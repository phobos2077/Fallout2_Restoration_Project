{100}{}{You see a chubby merchant with an eyepatch.}
{101}{}{One-Eyed Roy watches you intently with his good eye as he mops sweat from his forehead.}
{200}{}{[As you and Krom approach the meeting site, you're greeted by a chubby merchant with an eyepatch and a
 small entourage of bodyguards. Though the merchant is sweating profusely, he appears downright cheerful.]}
{201}{}{[MORE]}
{202}{}{[After the merchant gives Krom an enthusiastic greeting, he turns to you and looks you over. Though his grin
 never falters, his probing eye betrays a hint of suspicion.] So Krom here says I'm to do business with you today.
 [He shrugs.] Folks call me One-Eyed Roy, but I can't for the life of me figure out why. [He laughs heartily at his joke.]
 What's your name, friend?}
{203}{}{I'm }
{204}{}{ of Arroyo.}
{205}{}{. Now let's get this underway.}
{210}{}{A true pleasure to meetcha, }
{211}{}{. If you don't mind me saying, you're a bit of an odd sort for a tribal.}
{212}{}{I'm not your average tribal. In fact, I'm the Chosen One.}
{213}{}{I don't know what you mean. I'm just your average Joe Tribal. Nothing odd about me at all.}
{214}{}{Oh, because of what I'm wearing? You see, I'm trying to set a new tribal fashion trend. I'm tired of the same ol'
 brahmin hide pants with a strap across the chest. That look is *so* 2240.}
{215}{}{Who are you calling an "odd sort", you tubby one-eyed motherfucker? [Attack.]}
{220}{}{[His grin falters slightly and he nods.] Alright, down to business then. Tell me, friend, have you ever heard
 of a little item called... a stimpak? [As he dramatically speaks the last word, he produces a stimpak from his coat
 pocket and holds it up like a wondrous artifact.]}
{230}{}{[His eye goes wide and he lets out a low whistle.] The Chosen One, huh? Well color me impressed. Now let's say
 we get down to business. Tell me, friend, have you ever heard of a little item called... a stimpak? [As he dramatically
 speaks the last word, he produces a stimpak from his coat pocket and holds it up like a wondrous artifact.]}
{240}{}{Whatever you say, friend. Now let's get down to business, shall we? Have you ever heard of little item called...
 a stimpak? [As he dramatically speaks the last word, he produces a stimpak from his coat pocket and holds it up like a
 wondrous artifact.]}
{241}{}{Uh, yeah. Actually, they're pretty common.}
{242}{}{Of course. In fact, I hoard the things. Hell, I'm practically a stimpak junkie.}
{243}{}{[Shake your head and stare at the item in wonder.] What's... stim-pak?}
{250}{}{[He chuckles nervously.] I wouldn't say they're *common*, but they're certainly coveted by us civilized folks.
 [He looks at Krom.] And for good reason. You see, these little guys contain magical healing powers that will *astound*
 and *amaze* you. Of course, words mean nothing without proof, so allow me to show you the wonders of the stimpak in action.}
{251}{}{[His eye momentarily hardens, but he quickly regains his composure and looks at Krom.] You see, these little guys
 contain magical healing powers that will *astound* and *amaze* you. Of course, words mean nothing without proof, so allow
 me to show you the wonders of the stimpak in action.}
{252}{}{An excellent question my friend! A stimpak is one of the many great marvels left to us by the Old World. You see,
 these little guys contain magical healing powers that will *astound* and *amaze* you. Of course, words mean nothing without
 proof, so allow me to show you the wonders of the stimpak in action.}
{253}{}{This should be interesting. Let's see it.}
{254}{}{I already know how they work, I've used them myself plenty of times.}
{260}{}{[He grins at you and Krom, then turns to one of his bodyguards.] Warren, come give me your hand. [The guard frowns,
 but does as he's told. Roy quickly takes out a knife and slashes it across the top of Warren's arm. Warren
 winces with pain but does not cry out. Roy grins at you.] As you can see, Warren's got quite a nasty gash here.}
{261}{}{[MORE]}
{262}{}{I assure you friends, the cut, and Warren's pain, are quite genuine. You can see this is no trick blade. [He hands
 the knife to Krom, who hardly glances at it before nodding and handing it back.] But now, look. [He injects the stimpak
 into Warren's arm. Almost instantly, the bleeding stops. Roy uses a dirty rag to mop away most of the blood, revealing a
 gash that's nearly healed.]}
{263}{}{[MORE]}
{264}{}{Now just imagine the advantage having stimpaks would give you over your rival tribes. And unlike that healing
 powder you fellas like to brew up, the stimpak does *not* cause drowsiness. In fact, this little wonder is completely
 *without* side effects. But I know what you're thinking, they must cost a fortune, right? Wrong. Because I *like* you,
 I'm practically giving 'em away for nothing.}
{270}{}{[Ignoring your comment, he grins at Krom, then turns to one of his bodyguards.] Warren, come give me your hand.
 [The guard frowns, but does as he's told. Roy quickly takes out a knife and slashes it across the top of Warren's arm.
 Warren winces with pain but does not cry out.] As you can see, Warren's got quite a nasty gash here.}
{275}{}{How much?}
{276}{}{Practically giving them away? How much are you asking?}
{280}{}{I'll give you this entire crate full of 'em -- that's *fifty* stimpaks—and all I ask in return is a measly *twenty*
 golden gecko pelts. You just can't beat a deal like that.}
{281}{}{[To Krom.] He's right, that's a good deal. Great, actually. [To Roy.] We'll do it.}
{282}{}{That's a good deal alright. Too good. What's the catch?}
{283}{}{We'll offer you ten golden gecko skins. No more.}
{284}{}{Let me think it over for a moment.}
{285}{}{No deal.}
{290}{}{[Roy's face lights up.] Excellent choice! It's a deal then. [The items are quickly exchanged, then Roy hastens
 off to his next stop.]}
{300}{}{[Roy chuckles and glances at his bodyguards before returning his eye to you.] Look, a single stimpak is worth much
 more than a single golden pelt. So you see, I'm already offering them to you at an outrageous discount. To ask more of me
 would be robbery. Twenty pelts, or I'll move on to a tribe that's more reasonable.}
{301}{}{Alright. We'll do it.}
{302}{}{Then you better get moving. No deal.}
{303}{}{Let me think about it a moment.}
{305}{}{[Roy frowns and scratches his scruffy neck. Finally, he lets out a long sigh.] You're killing me, you know that?
 But as a favor to your tribe, I'll accept your deal. [The items are quickly exchanged, then Roy hastens off to his next
 stop.]}
{310}{}{[He frowns.] I don't know what kind of an idiot would turn down a deal like this. [He shakes his head and turns
 to his men.] Alright, let's go. [He glances back at you.] And fuck you for wasting my time.}
{311}{}{[Let them leave.]}
{312}{}{[Attack]}
{320}{}{No catch, my friend. I simply already have all the stimpaks I need, so I'm offloading my excess supply.
 Golden pelts, on the other hand... I could never have enough of those. Sure, fifty stimpaks are worth far more than
 a mere twenty golden gecko pelts, but I'm being realistic. I can't expect your tribe -- skilled hunters though I'm sure
 you are -- to have a hundred golden gecko hides laying around, so I'm making a more reasonable offer. *That's* why it's
 such a good deal.}
{321}{}{[To Krom.] He's right, that's a good deal. Great, actually. [To Roy.] We'll do it.}
{322}{}{Before we agree to anything, I'd like to have a look at the rest of the goods.}
{330}{}{[His eye narrows slightly, then he grins.] Of course. They're in this crate next to me.}
{331}{}{[DONE]}
{340}{}{Alright, but don't take too long. We've got another stop to make before nightfall.}
{350}{}{Alright, if you're done messing around, let's get this show on the road. I'm a busy man.}
{351}{}{Alright. We'll accept the deal.}
{352}{}{No deal.}
{353}{}{I need to think about this a little more.}
{354}{}{I've got a new deal for you: give us the stimpaks, and you get to keep your life.}
{360}{}{You're a busy guy, huh? You're also a liar and a cheat.}
{361}{}{Those stimpaks are fake. They're nothing but hypodermics filled with brahmin blood. You were trying to rip this tribe off.}
{362}{}{I need to think about this a little more.}
{363}{}{Alright. We'll accept the deal.}
{370}{}{[He shifts uncomfortably, and casts a nervous glance at Krom.] Wh-what are you talking about?}
{371}{}{Those stimpaks are fake. They're nothing but hypodermics filled with brahmin blood. You were trying rip this
 tribe off.}
{372}{}{Wha-- that's impossible. You saw the demonstration. They work fine. I'm not going to stand here and let you try
 and ruin my good name.}
{373}{}{Sure, the stimpak you used during the demonstration was real. But I'd like to see you try it again using one of the stimpaks in that crate.}
{374}{}{Fuck your good name. It's not going to be any use to you after I'm done. [Attack.]}
{380}{}{[He sneers.] Alright! Fine! If you say they're fake, then maybe they are. How should I know? I didn't make the
 fucking things -- I bought 'em. So *I'm* the one that was ripped off here -- not you. Now, since there's no deal, I'm not
 gonna waste my time here any longer. Bye.}
{381}{}{[Let them leave.]}
{382}{}{[Attack]}
{390}{}{Who the fuck do you think you are? [To his bodyguards.] Kill these goddamn tribals!}
