{100}{}{You have arrived on a desert plain outside of New Reno.}
{110}{}{You see several crates filled with chemicals.}
{120}{}{You see several crates filled with chemicals. You can't identify the chemicals,
 but they have been packed VERY carefully.}
{130}{}{Você vê um Vertibird.}
{140}{}{You see a Vertibird... an advanced form of helicopter. Unfortunately, you have no
 idea how to operate it.}
{150}{}{You have no idea how to operate it.}
{200}{}{(These guys give me the creeps...)}
{201}{}{(Shut up. Here they come.)}
{202}{}{*Zztttt* Do you have the cargo we requested? *Zzzttt*}
{203}{}{Yes, the chemicals are all here. You can check them if you like.}
{204}{}{*Zztttt* That will not be necessary. *Zzzttt*}
{205}{}{*Zztttt* You know what will happen if the chemicals do not meet the specifications
 we requested. *Zzzttt*}
{206}{}{Right, of course. Uh, and you brought the lightbringers...?}
{207}{}{*Zztttt* The laser weapons are in our cargo bay. *Zzzttt**}
{208}{}{*Zztttt* To ensure your cooperation, we will transmit the arming sequence for them
 once the chemicals are loaded. *Zzzttt*}
{209}{}{Uh...well...all right then. Load her up, boys --}
{210}{}{*Zztttt* No. *Zzzttt*}
{211}{}{*Zztttt* We will load the cargo. *Zzzttt*}
{212}{}{Uh, right...right. Of course. Give them room, boys.}
{213}{}{All right; we're good here. The rest of you guards head back to Reno. We'll meet up with you.}
{250}{}{Look! Someone's been watching us!}
{251}{}{Kill them!}
{252}{}{Looks like we got us a spy...!}
{253}{}{*Zztttt* Mission aborted. Cargo failsafe sequence engaged. *Zzzttt*}
{254}{}{*Zztttt* Terminate hostiles, then return to base. *Zzzttt*}
{300}{}{Don't get near those armored fellas. They'll carve you up.}
{301}{}{Get back in position.}
{302}{}{Stop twitching...those armored guys don't like it much.}
{350}{}{Dammit! What are you doing, dipshit?!}
{351}{}{Get back to your post! What the hell are you do --?!}
{352}{}{*Zztttt* Mission aborted. Cargo failsafe sequence engaged. *Zzzttt*}
{353}{}{*Zztttt* Terminate hostiles, then return to base. *Zzzttt*}
{400}{}{[Looks like there is a door. Open it and climb in?]}
{401}{}{Yup}
{402}{}{Wander off}
{403}{}{Board the Vertibird.}
{404}{}{Leave it alone.}
{450}{}{[Once you climb inside the cargo hold, the door seals behind you! You attempt to force it open, but it won't
 budge. As you try to think of a way out, you hear the armored soldiers board the Vertibird, which then takes off with
 you trapped inside!]}
{451}{}{Uh-oh}
{452}{}{Oh, shit...}
{500}{}{These crates are filled with heavy metal canisters. Judging from the care packing
 them, you suspect that they contain some sort of hazardous chemicals.}
{550}{}{Now's probably not the best time to be striking up conversation.}
