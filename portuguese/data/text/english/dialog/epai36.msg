{200}{}{Welcome to the EPA Petting Zoo! Here you'll have the pleasure of interacting with these unique creatures that
 look like hideously deformed humans! That's because these ugly beasts are the result of exciting experiments where our
 brilliant scientists are attempting to splice human and animal DNA!}
{201}{}{[MAIS]}
{210}{}{In theory, this new science might one day allow us to create a "Super Person". Imagine a US Soldier with the sight
 of an eagle, the speed of a cheetah, and the strength of an ape! Imagine how this "Super Soldier" would strike fear into
 the hearts of commies! It sounds like science fiction, but it may soon be science fact!}
{211}{}{[MAIS]}
{220}{}{The creatures you see here are the results of experiments that haven't quite met with success. Instead of euthanizing
 these failed abominations, we thought it'd be fun to put them in a petting zoo. Don't worry, despite their horrific appearance,
 they're not likely to attack as long as they're well fed. We're happy to report only three visitor casualties have occurred
 in the past year!}

{300}{}{Welcome to our newest exhibit! The strange looking tentacled creatures you'll see in this cage might look like they
 came from outer space, but they're not aliens, in fact, they were made right here in America! As you may have guessed,
 these guys weren't created by mother nature, they were created by science!}
{301}{}{[MAIS]}
{310}{}{That's right, these fearsome monstrosities were engineered by American scientists in top secret laboratories, as
 the newest weapon in the war for freedom. Their powerful tentacles and sharp teeth were specifically designed to tear
 apart America's enemies. Their tentacles also excel at digging, so the commies won't even be safe in their underground
 bunkers! Also, these ferocious killers have skin so thick, that bullets have a hard time penetrating it!}
{311}{}{[MAIS]}
{320}{}{You're looking at the future of biological warfare! But don't worry, these vicious slaughter machines can't get
 you, as they're safely locked within the confines of their highly secure cage. You'll have to excuse the dim lighting,
 but these guys are happiest when dwelling in cool, dark places, and you wouldn't want them to get angry, would you?}
{321}{}{[Fim de sessão.]}
{400}{}{Here you can see plant life unlike any you've seen before! This exciting new species, derived from the Venus Fly
 Trap, was specifically engineered by our brilliant scientists to be able to survive in a world devastated by a nuclear
 war. Why would we want to do that? It's simple.}
{401}{}{[MAIS]}
{410}{}{After a global nuclear war, scientists believe that much of the Earth will become a barren wasteland. Plant life
 will have a difficult time surviving in this harsh new environment. Now imagine us emerging from the safety of our
 Vault-Tec vaults only to find that all the plants are dead! That'd mean no more salads for Mom, and no more lawns for
 Billy and Rover to play fetch in.}
{411}{}{[MAIS]}
{420}{}{Sounds terrible, doesn't it? But don't worry. These new plants may be the answer to that problem. Instead of
 relying on fertile soil and rainfall, they're able to derive nutrients by killing and eating animals, just like
 people! All through the wonders of science!}
