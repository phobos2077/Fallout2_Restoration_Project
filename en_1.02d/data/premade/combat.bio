
NARG'S STORY:

Narg's exceptional
physique has made him
one of the best hunters
in the tribe. Narg's 
first, and usually only,
impulse is to crush 
anything that he can't
figure out. Narg has
become quite adept at
crushing, and slicing,
and dicing. Narg would
like to prove his
worthiness to lead the
tribe and he'll let
nothing stand in his
way.
