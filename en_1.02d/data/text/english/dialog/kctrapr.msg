{100}{}{You see a scruffy looking person.}
{101}{}{You see a citizen of Klamath.}
{102}{}{You see a squatter.}
{103}{}{You see a backwoodsman.}
{104}{}{You see a trapper.}
{105}{}{You see a hunter.}

{110}{}{Heh, heh - you reckon you’re one of us now?}
{111}{}{We ain’t got nothing left to steal here.}
{112}{}{Trapper Town’s got bigger rats everyday. Some even stand erect.}
{113}{}{No room for you here.}
{114}{}{No squats left here.}
{115}{}{What are you looking at?}
{116}{}{Damn tribals, always stirring up trouble.}
{117}{}{You should go south.}
{118}{}{Something smells worse than a gecko pelt.}
{119}{}{Rats everywhere!}
{120}{}{By the Great Rat Spirit, what’s next?}
{121}{}{I’d offer a prayer to the Great Rat Spirit if you’re in town for long.}
{122}{}{Watch out, or you’ll end up just like Phil.}
{123}{}{You’re just like the Duntons.}
{124}{}{I don’t think we want you in this part of town.}
{125}{}{What’s your problem?}
{126}{}{(Mumble, mumble)...only one kind of good tribal, and that’s a...(mumble)}

{130}{}{This part of town’s for us professionals only.}
{131}{}{Hmm... You don’t look as though you could find a gecko if it bit you.}
{132}{}{I’m surprised you made it all the way here from your tribe.}
{133}{}{Watch out for the rats here.}
{134}{}{Golden geckos can grow five times as long as a man is tall.}
{135}{}{Them golden geckos have a deadly poison in their fangs.}
{136}{}{Anyone seen Phil? I think we lost another trapper to the rats last night.}
{137}{}{Have you seen Phil?}
{138}{}{Those rats are so hungry these days.}
{139}{}{There are supposed to be old mine tunnels underneath here.}
{140}{}{Wish I could figure out how to get to that Corvega.}
{141}{}{Watch out for slavers. They just love to take tribals.}
{142}{}{I sure wish I had enough money to get a bath.}
{143}{}{I want to go visit my Jenny.}
{144}{}{Another few pelts and I’ll be able to buy myself a bath.}
{145}{}{Mmm, I love that Dunton’s Drymeat.}
{146}{}{If the bugmen ever show up here, the rats will eat them. Heh, heh.}
{147}{}{Yessir, there are old tunnels underneath Klamath. You better believe it.}
{148}{}{Lots of stuff crawling around in those buildings.}

{150}{}{You look as though you know your way around the woods.}
{151}{}{Trapping geckos is dangerous -- but it pays well.}
{152}{}{I hate all the rats here. They’re too dang smart for the traps!}
{153}{}{Watch out for golden geckos; they’re twice as tough as the ordinary ones.}
{154}{}{You’re from the Arroyo tribe, ain’t you? Can tell by your looks.}
{155}{}{Sometimes I think I’ve seen a really big rat back in the buildings here.}
{156}{}{It’s cheap to live here, but you have to put up with rats.}
{157}{}{(Chewing noisily) Rat tastes better than most people think. Hungry?}
{158}{}{You know, geckos taste a lot like something else if you cook them right. Can’t rightly
 remember what, though.}
{159}{}{Some animals like drymeat so much that they’ll run for it instead of you.}
{160}{}{Remember, if you ever sell too many gecko hides at once, their price will drop.}
{161}{}{Someday, I want to get a weapon with some range to it.}
{162}{}{I swear I’ve seen bugmen out near the brahmin grazing area east of town. }

{170}{}{I hated the rats here. I'm sure glad they're gone.}
{171}{}{Trapping geckos is dangerous but it pays well.}
{172}{}{Watch out for golden geckos, they're twice as tough as the ordinary ones.}
{173}{}{You're from the Arroyo tribe ain't you? Can tell by your looks.}
{174}{}{There used to be a lot more rats. Can't say's I miss 'em.}
{175}{}{Those rats been deserting this place like it was sinkin'.}
{176}{}{(Chewing noisily) Rat tastes better than most people think. Hungry?}
{177}{}{You know geckos taste a lot like something else if you cook them right. Can't
 rightly remember what though.}
{178}{}{Some animals like drymeat so much that they'll run for it instead of you.}
{179}{}{I haven't heard that weird voice comin' from the rat caves lately. Wonder
 where it went?}
{180}{}{Y'know, don't laugh at me, but I think the Rat God's dead.}
{181}{}{I heard that the Rat God's dead. Not that I believe in stuff like that.}

{200}{}{You see a rough-hewn person with leather boots.}
{201}{}{You see a person who must spend a lot of time outdoors.}
{202}{}{You see a person with roughly made and repaired clothing.}
{203}{}{You see a rough-hewn trapper with gecko-hide boots.}
{204}{}{You see someone who spends a lot of time in the wilderness. They're wearing
 a gecko-pelt shirt.}
{205}{}{You see a trapper who makes his home in Trapper Town.}
