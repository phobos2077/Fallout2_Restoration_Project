{157}{}{I do have a question for you.}
{158}{}{Goodbye, my friend.}
{159}{}{Oh, you're testing me. Go see Hakunin in the north corner of the village. He makes our
 medicines.}
{160}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{161}{}{Well, I've seen them when Mynoc has us guard the bridge, but he does all the dealing.

{174}{}{ Have a safe journey, dull one -- for our sake.}
{175}{}{????}
{176}{}{You betray us.  You must die.}

{178}{}{Why do you do this?}
{179}{}{Death to the evil one!}
