{100}{}{You see a nervous-looking fellow in a jumpsuit.}
{101}{}{You see Ferndown, the Vault City merchant agent.}
{102}{}{You see a frail and edgy-looking fellow in a dirty vaultsuit.}
{103}{}{I'm afraid that we can't pay you for abandoning the caravan. I'm sure that's what got Ben killed.}
{104}{}{Did you really think that I'd reward a thief? You're lucky that you weren't lynched on the
 trail. I won't pay you anything. Now get out.}
{105}{}{A thief? I resemble that remark, you damn ingrate! I'm leaving. Goodbye.}
{106}{}{Someday soon, you'll regret crossing me. Goodbye.}
{107}{}{Your caravan had so many losses that I can't think you really did your job. We can't reward that
 kind of failure.}
{108}{}{You cheap bastard! You'll pay for stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{109}{}{Well, sometimes you just get luckier than others. This was one of the unlucky times. Goodbye.}
{110}{}{We didn't quite lose everything on the caravan, but we lost more we can afford. If you'd done
 your job right, you'd be getting more than this $500.}
{111}{}{Well, something is better than nothing, I guess. Goodbye.}
{112}{}{You lousy bastard. Nobody could have done a better job. You'll regret stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{113}{}{That wasn't too bad at all. Here's your $1000. It'll be a while before we get another caravan
 master, so I don't know when we'll be travelling again.}
{114}{}{I don't think I ever want to spend so much time looking at the ass-end of a brahmin again. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{That wasn't too bad at all. See you later. Goodbye.}
{116}{}{That was a good run. Might not have worked out that way if you weren't along. Here's your $100,
 plus a $50 bonus for the great job. Thanks again. If only Ben had lived to see it.}
{117}{}{Nice to find someone who appreciates quality when he sees it. See you around, maybe. Goodbye.}
{118}{}{Always glad to make some extra money. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{119}{}{I can't believe that Ben took an idiot like you in. Well, I suppose that was his last work of
 charity. You were lucky to have survived. Goodbye.}
{120}{}{Ook?}
{121}{}{I'm sorry to lose Ben Wade. He was a good man and a hard one to replace. My name's Ferndown, and
 I'll take care of what we owe you.}
{122}{}{Uh, thanks.}
