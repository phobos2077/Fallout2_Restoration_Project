{100}{}{You see a sturdy, older woman with a tired smile.}
{101}{}{You see Ardin Buckner, the owner of Buckner house.}
{102}{}{You see a very fit and vivacious woman in her early fifties.}

{110}{}{You found my Smiley -- thank you so much! I just about gave him up for dead. I’m so angry with
 him! With him back I guess we won’t need Sulik anymore.}
{111}{}{Gecko bit Smiley. Smiley owie.}
{112}{}{I was happy to help out. I’m glad you’re letting Sulik go.}
{113}{}{I think he might still prefer you to the geckos. Tell me about something else though.}
{114}{}{Well, don’t be too hard on him. He wasn’t exactly enjoying himself, you know. Goodbye.}

{120}{}{I hear you hurt my boy Torr. I don’t know exactly what happened, but I don’t want you anywhere
 near here. Now get out.}

{130}{}{Hello there. My name’s Ardin Buckner and this is Buckner house.}
{131}{}{Argl. Goop}
{132}{}{Pretty, pretty house.}

{140}{}{You remind me of my boy Torr. I bet the two of you would get along just fine. Why don’t you run
 and talk to him? Goodbye.}

{150}{}{Hello there. My name’s Ardin Buckner and this is my place. Say, you didn’t see a trapper named
 Smiley outside of town did you? (Half to herself) He’s been gone for too long. Never should have let
 him go off on that fool quest of his.}
{151}{}{Smiley? No, I haven’t seen a trapper by that name. Tell me about him.}
{152}{}{I need something else right now.}
{153}{}{Hello, Ardin. I think I’ll be moving along now. Goodbye.}

{160}{}{You should talk to my daughter, Maida, about that. I don’t really keep track of what’s going on
 lately. Too much just keeping an eye on my own business.}
{161}{}{Oh, okay, I’ll do that. Right now, though, I need some information about something else.}
{162}{}{Well, I’ll talk to her about that then. Goodbye.}

{170}{}{You better not be planning any mischief here. What do you want?}
{171}{}{How can I help you, friend?}
{172}{}{Tell me about Smiley, the trapper.}
{173}{}{I was wondering if you’re the person to talk to about local news and events?}
{174}{}{I need a room, please.}
{175}{}{We need a room, please.}
{176}{}{I want to buy something.}
{177}{}{I guess I don’t need anything right now. Goodbye.}

{180}{}{Well, Smiley and me were getting downright serious with each other. I thought I had finally
 gotten him to agree to settle down here and help me run this place. But, he said he needed to go off
 on one last quest.}
{181}{}{A quest?}

{190}{}{I just handle the rooms here. If you want to buy or trade something, talk to my daughter, Maida.}
{191}{}{Oh, I see. Tell me something else then.}
{192}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}

{200}{}{We’re pretty full right now. Sorry.}
{201}{}{Well, let’s see here. We should have a room available. That will be $25.}
{202}{}{I’ll take it. Here’s the $25. Thanks.}
{203}{}{I don’t think I want that right now. Let me ask you something else.}
{204}{}{I don’t think I need the room after all. Goodbye.}

{210}{}{I’m afraid you don’t have enough money for that.}
{211}{}{Oops. I guess I am a bit light right now. Let me ask you something else.}
{212}{}{I’m sorry. I better go make some more. Goodbye.}

{220}{}{Thank you. I’m so happy you helped find my boy. I thought we’d never see his fool self again.}
{221}{}{Torr friend.}
{222}{}{I was happy to help.}
{223}{}{Wasn’t there something mentioned about a reward?}

{230}{}{Well, thank you. I think you might need someone with a few more smarts to help look after you -
 a travelling companion. I’ll talk to Maida about freeing up Sulik.}
{231}{}{Well, I just don’t know what we could ever do to thank you.}
{232}{}{Torr friend }
{233}{}{No thanks is necessary. Help was needed and I was there.}
{234}{}{Well, money is always a nice way of saying thanks.}
{235}{}{If you could consider Sulik’s debt paid, that would be reward enough.}
{236}{}{. Sulik friend?}

{240}{}{I’ll talk to Maida and she’ll take care of things with Sulik. You might want to talk to her
 also, though.}
{241}{}{Maida free Sulik. Maida }
{242}{}{Thank-you. I’m sure Sulik will be grateful for your forgiving his debt to you. I’ll talk to
 Maida right away. Goodbye.}
{243}{}{I’m glad that you don’t need Sulik anymore. There’s something I want to ask you.}
{244}{}{ friend.}

{250}{}{I don’t have much, but here’s $100. I wish it could be more, but with all the Brahmin we’ve
 lost that’s all we can afford. I’m sorry.}
{251}{}{Thanks Ms. Buckner. Goodbye.}
{252}{}{Maybe I should take a different reward.}

{260}{}{Well, surely there must be something that I can do to show you how grateful I am. Hmm, I’ll
 forgive Sulik’s debt. He’s free to go. I guess that not all tribals are troublemakers.}
{261}{}{That sounds good to me. Goodbye.}
{262}{}{Hmm, maybe I should take a different reward.}

{270}{}{I just don’t know what to think. My boy Torr’s missing. I sure wish someone would help me find
 him. He’s never been gone from home so long before.}
{271}{}{Torr?}
{272}{}{What happened?}
{273}{}{That’s nice, lady, but I need something from you.}
{274}{}{Well, I can tell you’re busy. I’ll come back later. Goodbye.}

{280}{}{He took off last night. I got mad at him after we lost those last few brahmin. We just can’t
 afford to lose any more, but all he would talk about is the bugmen taking them. That fool boy.}
{281}{}{Torr go?}
{282}{}{I think that the Duntons had something to do with the missing brahmin. You shouldn’t be too
 hard on Torr about it. Where do you think he went?}
{283}{}{Where do you think he went?}

{290}{}{Well, he kept saying that he was going to go get the bugmen where they live. You see, there’s
 a canyon just east of the field where we graze the brahmin. Lately, there’ve been some strange noises
 coming from there. }
{291}{}{Noises?}

{300}{}{Thank you for promising to look for my boy. I sure hope you can find him. I’m so worried about
 him. Hurry, please.}
{301}{}{Ok.}

{310}{}{Have you found my boy yet? I don’t know how long he can last out there on his own. Please find
 him for me.}
{311}{}{Torr?}
{312}{}{I haven’t given up yet, but there’s something I need first.}
{313}{}{I just wanted to see if he had come back yet. I’ll continue searching. Goodbye.}

{320}{}{Torr was sure that’s where the bugmen that he said were taking our brahmin came from. Said
 something about proving himself to us. I just wish someone would bring my boy back to me.}
{321}{}{Torr canyon. }
{322}{}{No go Torr.}
{323}{}{Sounds as though that canyon would be a good place to start looking. I’ll go look for your boy,
 Mrs. Buckner.}
{324}{}{I’d love to help -- if I weren’t quite so busy. I’m sure Torr will be alright on his own.
 Goodbye.}
{325}{}{ go Torr.}

{330}{}{Well, he called it a quest. He told me he thought he knew where all the golden geckos came from,
 and he wanted to find out for sure. He thought that maybe it was some kind of magical spring, or maybe
 a hidden cave or vault of some sort.}
{331}{}{Hmmm.}

{340}{}{Well, I don’t rightly know what all he said, but he seemed real excited about going. But I
 shouldn’t have let him go. He’s two weeks later getting back than he said he’d be and I’m worried.}
{341}{}{I’d like to help. I could look for him for you.}
{342}{}{Sorry to hear that. Let me ask you about something else.}
{343}{}{That’s too bad, Mrs. Buckner. Maybe he just ran out on you. I think I know why he would, too.
 Goodbye. }

{350}{}{Oh, thank you. Let me mark on your map where he talked about looking. I sure hope you can
 find him. He isn’t much, but I still love him and I miss him more than I thought I could. Please find
 him for me.}
{351}{}{I’ll do what I can. Let me ask you something first, though.}
{352}{}{I’ll do my best, Mrs. Buckner. Goodbye}
{353}{}{You know, I just don’t think I can help you right now. Goodbye.}

{360}{}{Have you found my Smiley yet?}
{361}{}{Sorry, Mrs. Buckner. I’m still looking for him. Let me ask you something else first, though.}
{362}{}{No, I’m just about to go look for him though. Goodbye.}

{370}{}{I think something horrible must have happened to my poor boy, Torr. I was counting on you (sob)
 to find him before it was too late. That poor simple boy. I can’t believe I counted on you.}
{371}{}{I wish you could have helped search for my poor boy, Torr. He was such a gentle soul and now
 he’s surely dead. I’ll miss him so.}
{372}{}{Sorry, Mrs. Buckner. I tried my best to find him for you. Uh, there was something I wanted
 though.}
{373}{}{Maybe I can help recover what’s left of his body for you. Goodbye.}
{374}{}{Torr? Who Torr? (you shrug) Goodbye.}
{375}{}{I’m sorry -- I wanted to help, but I couldn’t. Uh, I hate to mention it at a time like this,
 but there’s something that I want.}
{376}{}{I guess I should come back at another time. Goodbye.}

{380}{}{Well, somehow that doesn’t surprise me much. Oh my, I yelled at my poor boy when it wasn’t
 even his fault. (sob) I’ll get those Duntons. They’ve gone too far this time.}
{381}{}{I’m sorry about that. Where do you think Torr went?}

{390}{}{Ok.}

{400}{}{Have you found my Smiley yet?}
{401}{}{Who? Oh, uh, no. I don't know where he went. Uh, say, let me ask you about something else.}
{402}{}{He's dead. He was eaten by geckos.}
{403}{}{I, uh, saw him. He said he was running off with another woman. Whoa! Look at the time. I've gotta run.}
{404}{}{Uh, I, uh, we, that is...Uh, no. I'm still looking for him. I'm sure he'll show up any day now. Uh, Goodbye.}

{410}{}{Eaten by geckos? I just don't believe you. Geckos would never catch my Smilely, he's too good a trapper for that. You must be mistaken.}
{411}{}{Yeah, you're probably right. Sorry for the scare. Let me ask you about something.}
{412}{}{Nope, I saw him, or what was left of him anyway. Not a pretty sight. Well, see ya later. Goodbye.}
{413}{}{I guess you've got me there. Heh, heh, I was just pulling your, ah, leg. Yeah, that's it. Well, Goodbye.}

{420}{}{I thought they were up to their usual tricks! My poor little Torr. I'll take care of those two bullies right away. They won't be doing that again. Thank you.}
{421}{}{Happy to help, ma'am. Let me ask you about something.}
{422}{}{Those Duntons make me sick. I'm glad you'll take care of them. Goodbye now.}

{500}{}{I think the Dunton brothers are rustling your brahmin. I just thought you should know, ma'am.}
{510}{}{You didn't see a trapper named Smiley outside of town did you? (half to herself) He's been gone for too
 long. Never should have let him go off on that fool quest of his.}
{520}{}{You've been so helpful with things around here. Thanks.}
{530}{}{I was just wondering what else is going on around here.}

{600}{}{You're wonderful.}
{610}{}{You're wonderful. You've returned my son Torr and my Smiley to me. I can't thank you enough.}
{620}{}{You've found my son Torr. Thank you so much.}
{630}{}{You're the one that found my Smiley. Thank you, thank you so much.}
{640}{}{I'm glad I could help you out. It'd be a shame to lose two people so close to you like that.}
{650}{}{Torr just needs a little help from time to time. I'm glad I was there for him.}
{660}{}{Smiley got lucky this time. You just tell him to be a bit more careful.}
{670}{}{Happy to help, Mrs. Buckner. Let me ask you about something.}
{680}{}{Gurrrrg bloop?}
{690}{}{Think nothing of it, ma'am. Goodbye.}

{700}{}{Torr's dead.}
{710}{}{Smiley's dead.}
{720}{}{I, uh, I don't know where they are. Say can I ask you a question?}
{730}{}{They're both dead as doornails.}
{740}{}{Torr left? What do you mean?}
{750}{}{I don't know where he is. Let me ask you something, maybe they'll return while we're talking.}
{760}{}{I'm still looking for them. I better get back to it. Goodbye.}
{770}{}{I'm still looking for him. I better get back to it. Goodbye.}
{780}{}{I uh, don't know where he is. Hmm... Wow, look at the time. I've got to go.}
{790}{}{Say, let me ask you something.}
{800}{}{Well, there's a lot of work for me to get to. Goodbye.}
{810}{}{Urrrrrgh.}

{900}{}{Have you found my son, Torr, yet? I'm so worried about him.}
{910}{}{Have you found my Smiley yet?}
{920}{}{Have you found my son, Torr, or my friend, Smiley the trapper, yet?}
{930}{}{My poor Torr's run off.}

{940}{}{I don't believe you.}
{942}{}{Oh, it's true. They're probably both worm food by now - well, the few scraps that haven't been turned
 into gecko shit anyway. Well, them's the breaks. See ya.}
{943}{}{Uh, I guess that was a bad *joke*, sorry.}

{950}{}{I don't want to talk to you.}
{951}{}{Get out of here.}
{952}{}{Damn, tribals. Nothing but trouble.}
{953}{}{Get out of here, you savage.}
{954}{}{I don't tolerate your kind here.}
{955}{}{You'll get nothing from me, tribal.}
{956}{}{You've enough harm here.}
{957}{}{Just leave me alone.}
{958}{}{Tribal troublemaker, get out of my place.}
{959}{}{I've had enough of you. Get out.}
