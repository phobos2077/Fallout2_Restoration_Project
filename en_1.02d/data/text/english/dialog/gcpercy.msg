{104}{}{I was glad to help you out.}
{105}{}{What do I get?}
{106}{}{Well, it better be worth it. That sure was a lot of work, and a lot of travelling too. Hazardous, that's what it was. I coulda been hurt.}
{107}{}{You shore you don't want to help ole Percy out with his problem? I shore could use the help.}
{108}{}{Uh, let me think about it a bit longer. In the meantime, got anything to trade?}
{109}{}{Well, why don't you tell me about it again.}
{110}{}{I didn't know you were going to pester me about that everytime I came in. Sheesh. Goodbye.}
{111}{}{You find Woody yet? I'm a-gettin' real worried-like. He ain't never been gone so long afore.}
{112}{}{Uh, not yet, but I'm still looking. Hey, do you have anything I could barter for?}
{113}{}{No, I sure haven't. I better get back out there and keep looking.}
{114}{}{Hello there, Percy Crump here, Master Merchant in this locality. But you kin call me just plain ole Percy. Yes, you can.
 Heck, everybody does. Now, what can I do ya' for?}
{115}{}{What can ole Percy do fer ya?}
{116}{}{I was just wondering what's going on here in town.}
{117}{}{I was wondering if you had anything I could buy or trade for?}
{118}{}{Uh, nothing really, I was just looking around. Goodbye.}
{119}{}{Trade?}
{120}{}{Goo? Me go bye-bye.}
{121}{}{Jist wanna congra-chew-late you fer makin' our atomic reactor run so purdy. She's a purrin' like a kitten now.
 Anyhow's, t'other than that, my friend Woody's done gone missin'.}
{122}{}{I gotta be thankee-kindly for fixin' up our Atomic Reactor. That dang fool Festus tweren't never no darn good.
 Anyhow's, t'other than that, my friend Woody's done gone missin'.}
{123}{}{Not a whole lot new here in town. I hear Wooz rooked some newbie out of a Black Orchid the other day.  Heh, heh, hee.
 Anyhow's, t'other than that, my friend Woody's done gone missin'.}
{124}{}{Well, tell me more about that.}
{125}{}{Oh, that's too bad. Well, I hate sad tales. I'll leave you alone with your grief. Goodbye.}
{126}{}{Why I shore do, heck, got all kinds of stuff here fer the right price I do.}
{127}{}{Get everything you need or do you want some more?}
{128}{}{Me want stuff?}
{129}{}{Hmm, let's see what you've got.}
{130}{}{Let me take another look at your wares.}
{131}{}{That's it for me. Thanks, Percy. Goodbye.}
{132}{}{Oog. Me go bye-bye.}
{133}{}{This big ole chest of antee-radee-ation medicine shore ain't doin' me no good. Jist about a hunnert-sumpin' years too
 late fer me ta use it. Heh, heh, heee. Here ya go, I'm findin' that friends is worth more'n more every year. Thanks...friend.}
{134}{}{I was glad to help you and Woody. Thanks for the meds.}
{135}{}{Cool, easy job for lotsa loot. I like it.}
{136}{}{Well you see, I had a friend, name o' Woody. That Woody, he can sleep like nobody I ever did see. What's worse, he
 likes to travel. Really likes to kick up the dust that one does.}
{137}{}{Okay.}
{138}{}{Well, that ain't so much of a problem, 'round here that is. But, last I heard Woody was goin' to take a stroll over
 to the Den. You know where the Den is?}
{139}{}{Yes, I know where the Den is. Go on.}
{140}{}{Actually, I don't know where the Den is.}
{141}{}{Oh, it's real easy to get to. Here: I'll mark it in for ya on your little mappy-thing-doohickie.}
{142}{}{Hey, be careful with that! Okay, go on now.}
{143}{}{Well, anyhows, like I been sayin' that ain't so much of a problem 'round Gecko. But, ya see, people in other parts
 ain't so usta the way we look.}
{144}{}{So?}
{145}{}{Cain't ya put two an' two ta-gether? I'm worried that Woody might have takin' himself a nap in the Den - it's a long
 trip after all - and then they woulda buried the poor cuss alive! I need someone to go look fer 'im there.}
{146}{}{And...?}
{147}{}{Well, I miss 'im. That's why. (Percy blinks, moistly, at you) Oh, I see, you wanna know what's in it for you?}
{148}{}{This is usually the part where I get more interested. Tell on.}
{149}{}{Well, I know where I kin get ahold of a heck of a lot of pre-war stock of, jan-u-wine, Rad-X and RadAway. Don't do me
 no good no how, but I figure that outgha be worth sumpin to a smoothy like you. You gonna take the job fer me or not? I'll
 only pay ya off if'n I know Woody's safe.}
{150}{}{Just how much is a heck-of-a-lot?}
{151}{}{Yes, I'll do it. I'll get back to you soon.}
{152}{}{No, I don't think I want to help you out right now.}
{153}{}{Let me think about it. Goodbye.}
{154}{}{It's a darn sight more'n you'll ever need, that's how much it is. You gonna do it?}
{155}{}{Yes, I'll do it. I'll get back to you soon.}
{156}{}{No, I don't think I want to help you out right now.}
{157}{}{Let me think about it. Goodbye.}
{158}{}{Thankee-kindly for findin' my pal Woody. Now what kin ol' Percy do fer ya?}
