{116}{}{Okay... but I’m not happy about it. I may be forced to file a formal
 complain--}
{117}{}{Well, I’m staying.}
{118}{}{I do not want to use force, but I will if necessary. Do not make this any
 more difficult than this has to be.}
{119}{}{Okay, fine, fine... I’ll go.}
{120}{}{You so much as touch me, and you'll be wearing your ass as a hat.}

{137}{}{I'm sorry... I don't recognize you. I'm under orders to only let Citizens I know into the Vault.
 Perhaps First Citizen Lynette can help you. Good day.}
{138}{}{Hello, Captain. Can I help you?}
{139}{}{Oh, okay.}
{140}{}{Oh, sure. I was just looking.}

{147}{}{A mutant? Where?}
{148}{}{He's with me.}
{149}{}{He's traveling with me. If any of you racists have a problem with that, maybe we should settle it right here and now.}
{150}{}{If that creature is with you, then you both belong back out in the Courtyard, not in the Vault City streets.}
{151}{}{All right, we'll go peacefully.}
{152}{}{Why don't you try to escort us out of here? I guarantee it'll be an educational experience.}
{153}{}{How do these Outworlders get in here in the first place...?}

{160}{}{Guards! Intruders in the City!}
{161}{}{Hrnghhhhhhhh!}
{162}{}{You're going to be dead before those friends of yours show up.}
{163}{}{Hey! You're the one who defeated the Enclave!}
{164}{}{Look, it's the one who defeated the Enclave!}
{165}{}{Welcome to Vault City.}
{166}{}{Your battle against the Enclave impressed even the First Citizen.}
{167}{}{I heard you've traveled as far south as San Francisco. Is that true?}
{168}{}{Is it true that the U.S. was still fighting the war?}
{169}{}{You should catalog your travels in the Vault City computer.}
{170}{}{You're welcome to stay in Vault City as long as you want.}
{171}{}{You should catalog your exploits against the Enclave and put it up on the List Server.}
