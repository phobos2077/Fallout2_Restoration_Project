{100}{}{You see a short, swarthy man smiling at you.}
{101}{}{You see Sajag, the owner and barman of the Golden Gecko.}

{110}{}{Hello there, stranger. Welcome to the Golden Gecko Tavern, Hotel, and Trading Post. I’m Sajag;
 I run the place. What can I get for you?}
{111}{}{Oh eh oh?}
{112}{}{Grink! (point at glass)}
{113}{}{I’ll have a drink.}
{114}{}{I’d like to buy a round of drinks for the whole bar, to introduce myself.}
{115}{}{I’d like to trade.}
{116}{}{I’d like a room for the night.}

{120}{}{Well, if it’s not another dang idiot. Just like Torr. Get the hell out of my bar.}

{130}{}{You’re our kind of people. You came to the right tavern to spend your money. What can I do for
 you, pal?}
{131}{}{You don’t seem to be too popular in this part of town. Well, maybe the jury’s still out on you.
 How can I help you?}
{132}{}{I need some beer.}
{133}{}{I would like to buy a round of drinks for everyone in the bar.}
{134}{}{I’d like to trade.}
{135}{}{I’d like a room for the night.}
{136}{}{Thanks for your help. Goodbye.}
{137}{}{Goodbye.}

{140}{}{One tall mug of Golden Gecko Piss coming up. Only $5 for the best beer north of Redding.}
{141}{}{You poured me a mug of piss!?!}
{142}{}{Thanks for the beer. I need some information though.}
{143}{}{Thanks. That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.}

{150}{}{A round of piss for the whole bar then! Huzzah! That’ll be $30. (Big smile)}
{151}{}{Everyone in here is drinking lizard piss!?!}
{152}{}{Hope everyone enjoys the beer. Sajag, I need some information.}
{153}{}{Enjoy your piss, everyone. Goodbye.}

{160}{}{Looks as though you don’t have enough money for that right now. Sorry, friend. No credit here.
 (smiles)}
{161}{}{Just like one of your kind to try and get something for nothing. No money, no service; now get
 out.}

{170}{}{Relax, pal; it’s just what we call the beer here. (chuckles) This is the Golden Gecko, remember?}
{171}{}{It’s just beer. Golden Gecko, Gecko Piss? Are you slow or what? (shakes his head) Tribals,
 sheesh.}
{172}{}{Oh. Heh, heh; well, back at Arroyo we actually...Uh, never mind.}
{173}{}{Oh, I get it. Well, aren’t you folks clever.}
{174}{}{I’m not drinking piss! I don’t care where it’s being served or what you call it!}

{180}{}{Well, now that we’ve got first things first out of the way...how can I help you? (smiles)}
{181}{}{Nice of you to drink with us lowlifes. (snickers) Just what do you want anyway?}
{182}{}{I think I’ll have another drink.}
{183}{}{I’d like to buy a round of drinks for all my new friends here.}
{184}{}{I have some questions for you.}
{185}{}{I think that’s all I need for now, thanks.}

{190}{}{Well information’s what it’s all about, pal. What do you want to know about?}
{191}{}{Yeah? What the heck do you want to know about?}
{192}{}{Are there any other settlements nearby?}
{193}{}{Are there any traders here in Klamath?}
{194}{}{Anything unusual going on here in Klamath?}
{195}{}{I’m looking for a job. Any leads?}
{196}{}{Where can I get healing supplies?}
{197}{}{I’m looking for something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Know where I might find such a
 thing?}
{198}{}{That’s all I need to know for now. But there’s something else I need.}
{199}{}{I guess, that’s enough info for now.}

{210}{}{Hey there, friend. A little bird told me that you know where old Whiskey Bob has his still. I
 sure would like to know where that is.}
{211}{}{You’re mistaken. I’ve never met anyone named Whiskey.}
{212}{}{I don’t think I want to tell you that.}
{213}{}{Why do you want to know where that is?}
{214}{}{I might know that. What’s it worth to you?}
{215}{}{Can’t stand a little competition, huh?}

{220}{}{Forget I mentioned it then. Not a big thing. (smiles)}

{230}{}{Well, Bob’s getting in the way of certain business partners. I don’t mind the competition.
 (grins) But they sure do. I’ll pay $50 to a smart cookie that can tell me where the still is. No other
 action required. (smiles)}
{231}{}{The story is that Bob’s homemade hootch is making people sick. I’ll pay $50 just to know where
 the still is, and then we can get the town council to shut him down. (smiles warmly)}
{232}{}{$50 is a good price -- especially when I don’t need to do anything myself to get it.
 (you give directions to the still)}
{233}{}{I don’t think I should tell you where the still is.}
{234}{}{I just don’t think Bob’s whiskey is making people sick.}
{235}{}{I’ll tell you where it is for $50. But, I want to hear more about your business partners.
 (you give directions to the still)}

{240}{}{Thanks for the information, friend. I’ll make sure it’s put to good use. (smiles) Here’s your
 $50 and a piss on the house, too. Anything else I can help you with?}
{241}{}{I think I’d like to have a nice piss to celebrate.}
{242}{}{How about a piss for all of my friends here?}
{243}{}{I have some questions that I’d like to ask you.}
{244}{}{That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.}

{250}{}{Well, let’s just say that I have connections with some important people south of here -- in the
 Den.}
{251}{}{Well, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the money.}

{260}{}{I’ve got all kinds of things right here, kid: healing supplies, booze, all kinds of stuff. I've
 got special sources, ya' might say. Always willing to look at a good gecko pelt, too.}
{261}{}{Let me see what you’ve got.}
{262}{}{I guess I don’t need anything right now. But I do have some questions.}
{263}{}{Special sources? Then you should be able to give me a really good price.}

{270}{}{Always plenty of rooms here for our friends. Only going to cost you $20 for eight hours of safe
 and comfortable shut-eye. A whole room to yourself. Have a party.}
{271}{}{We don’t have any rooms here, pal. Sorry, full up.}
{272}{}{$20 sounds like a fair price to me. I’ll take it.}
{273}{}{I don’t think I’ll take you up on that offer just now, Sajag. What about something else?}

{280}{}{Hey pal, thanks for the information. My friends down in the Den aren’t worried about any
 competition anymore. (evil grin)}
{281}{}{Thanks for the information, friend. The town council, um, voted, to shut down Whiskey Bob’s
 still. He won’t be poisoning anyone else for a while. (sincere looking smile)}
{282}{}{I’m glad that I was able to help; of course, the $50 didn’t hurt, either.}
{283}{}{Well, I’m sure I’ll sleep easier knowing that Klamath is safe from Bob’s hooch.}
{284}{}{No skin off my back, pal.}

{290}{}{Well, let’s see. All sorts of things going on in town lately. (counts on his fingers) There’s
 brahmin-mutilating bugmen, rodents of unusual size, a walking spirit, and a missing hunter. Klamath’s
 become a real hot spot lately.}
{291}{}{Tell me about the brahmin-mutilating bugmen, please.}
{292}{}{Tell me about the RUS's, please.}
{293}{}{Tell me about the walking spirit, please.}
{294}{}{I’m not surprised that a hunter’s gone missing with all this excitement, but tell me about him,
 too.}
{295}{}{I’d like to ask about other things.}
{296}{}{I don’t want to know about anything else.}

{300}{}{Well, the Dunton brothers are always looking for someone to do their dirty work for them. And
 for that matter, Torr, the Buckner boy, is scared to go tend the brahmin at night on account of the
 bugmen.}
{301}{}{Thanks; I have another question for you.}
{302}{}{I guess that’s all I need to know. But I do need something else.}
{303}{}{That’s all I need for now. Goodbye.}

{310}{}{There are a couple of settlements nearby. There are some tribals northwest of us -— but I ‘spose
 you know about them. (smiles) Then there’s the Den a few days south of here -- that’s the closest --
 and there’s a mining town called Redding quite a ways to the southWest.}

{320}{}{Not too many traders in town. Just Vic, that I can think of. He’s got a house in the east
 part of town. He used to trade prewar stuff at the Den and to tribals. Haven’t seen him for a bit,
 though.}

{330}{}{Well, I don't have prices like this for just anybody. It's not easy to get this stuff from the
 Den.}
{331}{}{I’d like to make you one of my special friends, sweetheart. (grins) It’s not easy to get this
 stuff from the Den. Tell you what -— I’ll give you a special price on what I’ve got.}

{340}{}{I don’t know what you’re talking about, pal. Do you want to trade or not?}
{341}{}{Yeah, sure I want to trade. Sorry for asking.}
{342}{}{I guess I don’t want to trade with you after all.}
{343}{}{You’ve got connections to the Den. Come on - I know you can make me a better deal.}

{350}{}{Well, they say critters that look like man-sized bugs walking around on two legs are
 tearing open brahmin in the middle of the night. Only Torr’s caught a good look at them though. Scary,
 huh?}

{360}{}{Some say that there’s a gigantic rat, the size of a Corvega, that rules over all the rats over
 in Trapper Town (west of downtown). They say that it lives in an old mine underneath Trapper Town and
 that all the other rats bring it any shiny objects that they find. (licks his lips) Mmm, Shiny baubles.}

{370}{}{Well, west of town there’s a canyon. A few months back there was a bright light coming from there
 and then critters started disappearing. Tracks lead into the canyon, but none lead out. Spooky, huh?
 Some have heard a weird whining sound echoing off the canyon walls there, too.}

{380}{}{Well, Smiley was one of the best trappers there ever was. He up and left Mrs. Buckner one day,
 and said he was going to find where all the golden geckos come from. Said he’d be rich if he could
 find it. But he hasn’t come back -- and that was a while back, too.}
{381}{}{That’s incredible. Tell me more local news.}
{382}{}{That’s all I need to know for now.}

{390}{}{Garden of Eden, huh? Well, Jenny’s the closest I’ve been to the Garden of Eden. Only a few
 dollars to create that. (smiles) Sounds nice, but I don’t know where you’d find it. }
{391}{}{Well, that’s not quite what I was looking for. Let me ask you something else.}
{392}{}{That’s all I need to know for now.}
