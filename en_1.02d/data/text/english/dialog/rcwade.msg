{100}{}{You see a man dressed in a jumpsuit.}
{101}{}{You see Ben Wade, the caravan master for the Redding-Vault City run.}
{102}{}{You see a man dressed in a Vault Suit.}
{103}{}{You've got nerve coming 'round here for a job. You'll never work for me again.}
{104}{}{Get the hell out of my sight.}
{105}{}{Let's move 'em on out. Giddy-up!}
{106}{}{OK, let's go.}
{107}{}{Hello there. My name's Ben. Ben Wade. I'm in charge of trade caravans between Redding and Vault
 City. I can usually use an extra guard, and we're ready to leave right now.}
{108}{}{Hello there. My name's Ben. Ben Wade. I'm in charge of trade caravans between Redding and Vault
 City. I can usually use an extra guard or two. We leave town on the 1st of every month. If you want to
 sign on, make sure you're here then.}
{109}{}{What do you want now?}
{110}{}{Moo-moos?}
{111}{}{You need a guard, huh?}
{112}{}{What does this caravan transport?}
{113}{}{Why are you waiting until the 1st?}
{114}{}{I don't think that's for me. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{Seems like it gets harder every trip. }
{116}{}{Hah! They shoulda known better than to try to attack my caravan.}
{117}{}{Good thing you're along this trip.}
{118}{}{What a nuisance. Things just ain't what they used to be 'round here.}
{119}{}{These wastes just aren't as safe as they used to be.}
{120}{}{You're not a guard - you're a con-man. Get out of here, you coward.}
{121}{}{You left the caravan. Now leave here, as well.}
{122}{}{You're nothing but a thief. You've probably already taken your cut - now get out.}
{123}{}{A thief? I resemble that remark, you damn ingrate. I'm leaving. Goodbye.}
{124}{}{Someday soon, you'll regret crossing me. Goodbye.}
{125}{}{If you had done your job and guarded my caravan, then I'd have enough money to pay you. As it
 is...well, you reap what you sow. You get nothing.}
{126}{}{You cheap bastard! You'll pay for stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{127}{}{Well, sometimes you just get luckier than others. This was one of the unlucky times. Goodbye.}
{128}{}{That was a bad trip. I can only give you $500 - and even that will leave me broke. Sorry.}
{129}{}{Well, something is better than nothing, I guess. Goodbye.}
{130}{}{You lousy bastard! Nobody could have done a better job. You'll regret stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{131}{}{That caravan was a success. Here's your $1000. Pleasure working with you. Hope to see you again
 sometime.}
{132}{}{I don't think I ever want to spend so much time looking at the ass-end of a brahmin again. Goodbye.}
{133}{}{That wasn't too bad at all. See you later. Goodbye.}
{134}{}{Hoo-wee! That was a great run. $1000 for you, and another $200 as a bonus. You must be some kind
 of lucky charm. Join us again if you're going our way.}
{135}{}{Nice to find someone who appreciates quality when he sees it. See you around, maybe. Goodbye.}
{136}{}{Always glad to make some extra money. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{137}{}{Hard to say, really. I guess it depends upon how long it takes to get enough ore together. I'm
 no miner, but I'd guess it won't take longer than a couple of weeks.}
{138}{}{Well, because I'm not exactly sure how long it will take to get all the medical supplies together. Probably not much
 longer than a couple of weeks. Then we can go. Just keep checking back with me.}
{139}{}{What do you usually transport?}
{140}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{141}{}{Thanks, I'll do that. Goodbye.}
{142}{}{We're usually looking for caravan guards, but this caravan won't be ready for a while yet. Feel
 free to check back with me, though.}
{143}{}{When on the 1st?}
{144}{}{What does this caravan transport?}
{145}{}{Okay, thanks. Goodbye.}
{146}{}{Sorry, pal, we've already got enough throwbacks working in this caravan.}
{147}{}{Oh, okay.}
{148}{}{Well, we pick up mostly medical supplies in Vault City, and trade it to Redding in exchange for
 gold ore.}
{149}{}{That's interesting. You said you're looking for guards?}
{150}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{151}{}{Oh, okay. Goodbye.}
{152}{}{You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $1000, but I'm only
 paying you for the job since I only need one more guard. Ready to join us?}
{153}{}{You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $1000. Ready to join us?}
{154}{}{Sounds great. I'm ready. Let's go.}
{155}{}{I don't think I want to be a caravan guard. I'll see you around. Goodbye.}
{156}{}{You got safe transport and three hot meals a day. Now get out of here, you moron.}
{157}{}{Oooo? Bye bye.}
{158}{}{Arrrrrr! Me kill!}
