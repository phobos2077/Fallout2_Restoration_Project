{100}{}{You see a well-dressed man.}
{101}{}{You see AHS-9, the Great and Terrible.}
{102}{}{You see a well-dressed man.}
{103}{}{You blaspheme the Hub's name! You must die!}
{104}{}{Your perfidy knows no bounds!}
{105}{}{The Great Wheel will run you over!}
{106}{}{You are in the presence of AHS-9, the Great and Terrible. What is it you desire of him?}
{107}{}{Agh a nu, AHS!}
{108}{}{I'm looking for my people. I heard they came down this way in flying ships.}
{109}{}{I have many questions for you, AHS-9.}
{110}{}{The Enlightened One in NCR wanted me to deliver a letter. She said something about a reward?}
{111}{}{The Enlightened One in NCR wanted me to deliver a letter. Here you go.}
{112}{}{Oh, AHS-9, I come bearing a letter from your agent in NCR. I bow to your glory.}
{113}{}{Your death. Good bye, old man.}
{114}{}{Nothing, sorry.}
{115}{}{Yes, my child?}
{116}{}{Hinchoaf? [You can understand me?]}
{117}{}{Aagga diggle doodle doo! [Oh, thank goodness. I'm looking for my people. I need to get over the big water.]}
{118}{}{Poopy pants! [Well, thanks for your time. I have to be running along now. A pleasure talking to you.]}
{119}{}{I can't understand a word you're saying. Perhaps you should see Juan or Vikki about an alignment.}
{120}{}{Anks!}
{121}{}{Of course, child. The alignment has cleared your basic neurodynes and aligned them with mine and the spokes of the Great Wheel. What do you need?}
{122}{}{Aagga diggle doodle doo! [Oh, thank goodness. I'm looking for my people. I need to get over the big water.]}
{123}{}{B-b-b-enny [Nothing, thanks. It's just nice being able to talk to you. Bye!]}
{124}{}{If you'll agree to do me a favor, I can help you, child.}
{125}{}{Oik? [What is it? I'd be happy to be of assistance.]}
{126}{}{No!}
{127}{}{My counterpart, The Emperor of Shi-town, has been making my life miserable. I'd like you to end his. In return, I'll make sure you can get where you need to be.}
{128}{}{Ays! [I'll do it.]}
{129}{}{No!}
{130}{}{If you change your mind, let me know. Remember, I may be the only way you have of reaching your family.}
{131}{}{Ok. [What is this favor?]}
{132}{}{Didgeroo! [Thanks, I'd rather not owe anyone. So long!]}
{133}{}{Good. Let me know when you're done, and I'll begin making inquiries into ways we can achieve your goal at the same time. Farewell, child.}
{134}{}{D'bye! [So long, AHS-9. You're a great man.]}
{135}{}{Have you completed your task? Your future and that of the Wheel on this planet depend on it.}
{136}{}{Unh-uh [Not yet. I just wanted to say hi.]}
{137}{}{I'm working on it. I have some questions.}
{138}{}{Not yet. I'll get back to you.}
{139}{}{Greetings to you as well. Now, please finish your job so that I may aid you.}
{140}{}{Ng! Ng! [Yes, sir!]}
{141}{}{I can see by your emanations that you have succeeded in ridding the world of the polluting neurodynes of the Emperor.}
{142}{}{Jirsa! [Yes, I have. How is your part of the bargain coming along?]}
{143}{}{Yes, I have. Now I require your assistance in helping my people.}
{144}{}{If you go to Shi-town's docks, you will find the PMV Valdez. Enter the ship. Head to your right, and up to the captain's station. Hit the Go button, and the tanker will sail you to your destination.}
{145}{}{Anks! [It has been a pleasure, AHS-9. I wish you all the best. Good bye.]}
{146}{}{Flying ships? You must be referring to the Enclave and their vertibirds.}
{147}{}{Yeah, I guess so.}
{148}{}{Enclave? Enclave who?}
{149}{}{Trust me, child, you are referring to the Enclave.}
{150}{}{Yeah, okay. How do I find them?}
{151}{}{The Enclave are a remnant of the past - a neurodyne that has yet to be aligned. They have hidden bases all over the shards of old California, and their strongest stronghold is off to the west, over the waters.}
{152}{}{How do I get there?}
{153}{}{How do you know all this?}
{154}{}{That, my child, you will have to discover on your own. Ask around and you shall find the truth.}
{155}{}{Very helpful. I have more questions.}
{156}{}{How do you know all this?}
{157}{}{Whatever. Bye.}
{158}{}{Child, I am AHS-9.  I see many things that transpire in the fleshy world. Do you have more questions, or may I return to my meditations?}
{159}{}{More questions.}
{160}{}{Return to your meditations. I'm done.}
{161}{}{You have killed the Emperor and destroyed his minions?}
{162}{}{Yes, I have.}
{163}{}{Then there is no one who can stand in my way! But I see no need to be beholden to a mere tool. Farewell - and good riddance!}
{164}{}{Why, you scumbag. I'm going to kill you now.}
{165}{}{Oh. Well, if that's the way it's got to be. So long.}
{166}{}{A letter from the Enlightened One? Is that what she calls herself now? Bah. [he takes the letter from you] And she promised a reward? You have a reward - my gratitude. Good day.}
{167}{}{That's it? Old man, you're dead.}
{168}{}{Err, I had some questions.}
{169}{}{Gee, great. Bye.}
{170}{}{Address your questions to AHS-7. I am AHS-9, the Great and Terrible, and I have many matters on my mind. Trouble me not, meat.}
{171}{}{If you won't answer my questions, you'll answer my weapons.}
{172}{}{Whatever.}
{173}{}{Ahh, a letter from my field agent. Pity she calls herself "The Enlightened One" - it shows that she truly is not enlightened. You have my gratitude.}
{174}{}{No problem. I have a question or two, though.}
{175}{}{Great. Bye.}
{176}{}{Yes, my child?}
{177}{}{When does the spaceship take off?}
{178}{}{Do you have any tasks for me?}
{179}{}{Where does all the money we provide go?}
{180}{}{Oh, nothing. Forget it.}
{181}{}{My counterpart, The Emperor of Shi-town, has been making my life miserable. I'd like you to end his. In return, I'll make sure you can get where you need to be.}
{182}{}{Sure thing, boss. See ya.}
{183}{}{I'd rather not.}
{184}{}{Seek out Badger, whose caustic presence holds those  pathetic tanker vagrants together. Rid our fair city of him. When you have done so, visit AHS-7.}
{185}{}{Sure thing, boss. See ya.}
{186}{}{I'd rather not.}
{187}{}{I was not aware I had made it a request, child. Kill him!}
{188}{}{No.}
{189}{}{Oh, all right. I'll do it.}
{190}{}{You disobey the commands of AHS-9, the Great and Terrible? Then you shall die.}
{191}{}{Bring it on.}
{192}{}{Wait, I changed my mind.}
{193}{}{Too late, meat. You have shown you cannot be trusted. Die!}
{194}{}{-done-}
{195}{}{Child, there are some things you are not meant to know for now. [He smiles benignly.]}
{196}{}{All right. I have more questions.}
{197}{}{Hm. Bye.}
{198}{}{The ESS Quetzel will launch when the stars are right. }
{199}{}{Right-o. I have more questions.}
{200}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{201}{}{Your enburgled aura tells me that you come here meaning me no good. Tell me, child, do you wish to profit from your venture?}
{202}{}{Yes.}
{203}{}{No.}
{204}{}{No, I just want you to die.}
{205}{}{This, then, is my bargain: return to the Shi and eliminate Ken Lee and the Emperor. I will repay you with more money than you have ever dreamed.}
{206}{}{No, I don't think so.}
{207}{}{You've got a deal, fat man.}
{208}{}{Then go and smite those troublesome souls. I await word of your success. [He smiles beatifically.]}
{209}{}{So long.}
{210}{}{No, wait, I changed my mind. I want you dead.}
{211}{}{Ah, child, how could you stray from the path of truth like this? I see from your aura that you plan to kill me. I am bitterly disappointed. Bitterly. Ah well. Let us proceed.}
{212}{}{Yes, let's. Die.}
{213}{}{Remember, you will need to visit AHS-7 when you have completed your task.}
{214}{}{All our needs have been met. Now it is time for me to meditate.}
