{100}{}{You see a slender young man wearing glasses.}
{101}{}{It's Gunther, aide to President Tandi. At least that's what the sign on the door said.}
{102}{}{He looks officious and busy, the type born to be a bureaucrat that other folks hate.}
{103}{}{Can I help you?}
{104}{}{You again?}
{105}{}{Uhhhh - work. Work Tandi.}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{I'm here to see President Tandi about a job.}
{108}{}{Sorry, wrong office.}
{109}{}{You want job?}
{110}{}{Let's try this again. You help Tandi? Do job for Tandi?}
{111}{}{Yesyesyesyes!}
{112}{}{Tandi job. Me want.}
{113}{}{What you do?}
{114}{}{Uhhhh...me kill, me kill big!}
{115}{}{Uhhhh...me smart. Elder say I got brain-of-child. I got 2 brain. Me smart.}
{116}{}{You can't take the president's job!}
{117}{}{No?}
{118}{}{Oh. Okay.}
{119}{}{Right. I'm not sure that's what she's looking for. Oh well, she said send them all in.

You go. Talk Tandi now.}
{120}{}{NO! You are dumb. President must be smart, talk in two-syllable words! You no president.}
{121}{}{Oh. What me do?}
{122}{}{Me no like you. You yell. Bad man.}
{123}{}{My name is Gunther, personal assistant to President Tandi. Now, what can I do for you?}
{124}{}{I'm searching for Vault 13.}
{125}{}{I'm looking for the GECK.}
{126}{}{I understand the president has a job to be done.}
{127}{}{Madam President no longer grants interviews regarding Vault 13. I'm sorry. She's too busy to see every prospector who comes through.}
{128}{}{Huh? I don't get it.}
{129}{}{What about a GECK. She might know something about that?}
{130}{}{There was some talk about a job.}
{131}{}{You're useless. I'm going.}
{132}{}{Then I suggest you read the plaque on the statue outside. Now, good day.}
{133}{}{I have no idea what you are talking about. Do you have real question?}
{134}{}{I'm searching for Vault 13.}
{135}{}{I understand the president has a job to be done.}
{136}{}{Never mind.}
{137}{}{Ah yes. Well, she's instructed me to send in anyone asking about it. You're buzzed in. It's the door to my right.}
{138}{}{Madam President is finished with you? How did things go?}
{139}{}{Good. Me bye-bye.}
{140}{}{Just fine. Now, I'm out of here.}
{141}{}{Here to report the outcome of Vault 15?}
{142}{}{Yes.}
{143}{}{No.}
{144}{}{Well, I'm sorry, but Madam President is very busy. Why don't you come back when the job is done?}
{145}{}{Okay.}
{146}{}{Excellent! I'll buzz you right in.}
{147}{}{You bastard! Guards! Assassin! Murderer!}
{148}{}{Back so soon! Now what?}
{149}{}{Re-ward.}
{150}{}{The president said to see you about a reward.}
{151}{}{Mon-ey.}
{152}{}{I'm here to collect my pay.}
{153}{}{Your president said you should know there's a spy in your house - somebody named Feargus.}
{154}{}{Nothing.}
{155}{}{Of course, she just buzzed me about it. A reward of $6000 and NCR thanks you, she said. Now, there is work to be done. Goodbye.}
{156}{}{Let's see. Contract says $500. Here you are.}
{157}{}{In fact, she just buzzed me to change your amount - seems you earned a bonus. Here it is, $900 and NCR's thanks. Now, there is work to be done, so goodbye.}
{158}{}{Your president said you should know there's a spy in your house - somebody named Feargus.}
{159}{}{Goodbye.}
{160}{}{Feargus? I don't believe it!}
{161}{}{Take a look at this disk.}
{162}{}{Whatever. I'm out of here.}
{163}{}{Damn. Looks solid. Look, we'll take care of this. Here's $4000 for the info.}
{164}{}{I don't take blood money. I'm out of here.}
{165}{}{Thanks. Have a nice day.}
{166}{}{Oh, it's you. Look, this is not a good time. In fact, I think Madam President would rather not get you involved in anything else. Thank you and good day.}
{167}{}{Let me make myself clear. The President is not going to see you - now or ever. You've been paid. Now just leave.}

{171}{}{Me go.}
{172}{}{Absolutely nothing.}
{173}{}{You bitch! Guards! Assassin. Murderer!}

{174}{}{I've been to Vault 15 and I need to talk to your boss about it.}
{175}{}{Me need talk about Vault 15.}

{176}{}{You should know there's a spy in your house - somebody named F.}
