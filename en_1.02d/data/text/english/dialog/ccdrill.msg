{100}{}{You see a guard. }
{101}{}{You see the gate guard.}
{102}{}{You see a guard wearing power armor of an unusual design. There is an insignia on the breastplate that you are unfamiliar with.}

{103}{sgnt1a}{Welcome to Camp Navarro... a civilian! How in the hell did a civilian get on this base! I’ll have someone’s ass for dinner! Get this civilian off government property.}
{104}{sgnt1b}{Welcome to Camp Navarro... civilians! How the hell did civilians get on this base! I’ll have someone’s ass for dinner! Get these civilians off government property.}
{105}{}{Wait. I...}

{106}{sgnt2a}{Well I’ll be damned. I had you escorted off this base and here you are again. I don’t think you’re a civilian after all. More than likely you’re a spy! Sound the alarm and execute this maggot!}
{107}{sgnt2b}{Well I’ll be damned. I had the bunch of you escorted off this base and here you are again. I don’t think you’re civilians after all. More than likely you’re all spies! Sound the alarm and execute these maggots!}

{108}{sgnt3}{Welcome to Camp Navarro. So, you’re the replacement. What's your name, private?}
{109}{}{Uh... me }
{110}{}{I’m }

{111}{sgnt4}{Oh, lovely. They’ve sent me a mo-ron. Listen closely. You will stand guard at the hangar. This is your duty post. You will go there now and stay on guard until told otherwise. Now move it, soldier!}
{112}{}{Me go.}

{113}{sgnt5}{What was that? Did you forget something, maggot?}
{114}{}{My name is }

{115}{sgnt6}{I am not a Sir. I work for a living, you mo-ron. You will call me Sergeant or Sergeant Dornan. Do you understand me! }
{116}{}{Yes, Sergeant!}
{117}{}{Sure, Sarge. Whatever.}

{118}{sgnt7}{Outstanding. Proceed on the double to the hangar where you will stand guard duty. You will do a fine job. Do you understand?}
{119}{}{What am I guarding there, Sergeant?}
{120}{}{Yes, Sergeant!}

{121}{sgnt8}{You mo-ron, you are not to question my orders! When I say jump, you jump! When I say fight, you fight! When I tell you to die for your country, then you will certainly die! Have I made myself clear?}
{122}{}{Yes, Sergeant!}

{123}{sgnt9}{Welcome to Camp Navarro. So, you’re the new replacement... You are out of uniform, soldier! Where is your power armor?}
{124}{}{Uh... me not have.}
{125}{}{The base didn’t issue me any. They said it would be issued here.}
{126}{}{Uh... I wasn’t issued any armor.}
{127}{}{It so happens that you’re wearing it... I’ll just take it off your dead body!}

{128}{sgnt10}{Don’t have any? You expect me to believe that, maggot? The truth is you lost an expensive piece of army-issue equipment. That suit is going to come out of your pay, and you will remain in this mans army until you are five hundred and ten years old, which is the number of years it will take for you to pay for a Mark II Powered Combat Armor you have lost! Report to the armory and have a new suit issued to you, then report back to me, private! Dismissed!}
{129}{}{Okay. Me go get suit.}
{130}{}{Yes, Sergeant!}

{131}{sgnt11}{Those paper-shuffling jackasses! How the hell do they expect me to run this unit if they keep shortchanging me on supplies! Double-time it over to the armory and get your issue, then report back to me. Dismissed!}
{132}{}{Okay.}
{133}{}{Yes, Sergeant!}

{134}{sgnt12}{If I like you, you can call me Sarge. But guess what? I don’t like you! Do you understand?}
{135}{}{Yes, Sergeant!}

{136}{sgnt13}{Excellent! You’re in uniform now so I’m going to give you a rare opportunity. We are going to start over as if I never met your sorry ass. Would you like that, soldier?}
{137}{}{Yes, uh... Sargent!}
{138}{}{No! Me not care anymore. Me kick you ass.}
{139}{}{Yes, Sergeant!}
{140}{}{I don’t particularly care now that I’m wearing this nice armor. I’m going to kick your ass.}

{141}{sgnt14a}{Soldier, you are still out of uniform. I gave you a direct order to report to supplies and get your issue. Now, get out of my face and don’t come back until you look like a soldier!}
{142}{sgnt14b}{This is the second time you have come to me out of uniform, Soldier. There will not be a third!}
{143}{}{Okay! Okay! Me going.}
{144}{}{Screw this. Me tired of crap.}
{145}{}{Yes, Sergeant! I’m on my way.}
{146}{}{Fuck it. I’m not cut out for this.}

{147}{sgnt15a}{Trooper, what are you doing here? Get back to your guard post!}
{148}{sgnt15b}{Mo-ron. If I see you away from your post again, it will be the sorriest day of your short life!}
{149}{sgnt15c}{You are a danger to us all. That will end now.}

{150}{sgnt16}{This base is on alert and I don’t recognize you. Show me your papers, soldier.}
{151}{}{Me not have papers with on me.}
{152}{}{Me no need papers!}
{153}{}{I don’t have my papers with me. They’re in my footlocker.}
{154}{}{Papers? I’ve got your papers right here!}

{155}{sgnt17}{Wrong answer, maggot. You are to carry your papers with you at all times and you should know that!}
{156}{}{Oops.}

{157}{}{Stay alert, soldier!}
{158}{}{Good. You’re on the ball. Stay that way!}
{159}{}{Nothing to report, I see. Stay at your post.}
{160}{}{If I catch any of you sleeping I’ll make sure you sleep forever!}

{161}{}{Good! You found your duty station!}
{162}{}{Stay at your post until you’re relieved, soldier!}
{163}{}{At your duty post and awake. Excellent!}
{164}{}{Stay awake, stay alert, stay alive!}

{165}{}{Alert! Intruders on the base!}
{166}{}{Guards! Intruders!}
{167}{}{Who the hell let these bastards through? Guards!}
{168}{}{Alert! Spies in the complex!}

{169}{}{Where the hell is that screw-up private?!}

{200}{}{.}
{201}{}{, Sir!}

{300}{}{I told you not to come back here out of uniform!}
