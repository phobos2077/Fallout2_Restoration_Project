{100}{}{You see a person wearing dusty work clothes.}
{101}{}{One of Westin's ranch hands.}
{102}{}{Could be just a ranch hand, but could be a hired killer, too. Certainly looks ready for trouble.}
{103}{}{You supposed to be wandering around here?}
{104}{}{Talk to Felix if you're looking for a job, stranger.}
{105}{}{I'm so sick of brahmin.}
{106}{}{I hear the Bishops got it in for our boss.}
{107}{}{You wanna talk to somebody, talk to the foreman, Felix.}
{108}{}{You ain't with the Bishops are you?}
{109}{}{We know it was murder. We catch the snake, his death won't be quick.}
{110}{}{Felix swears the Bishops was behind this. Says there's money in it for somebody.}
{111}{}{Well, guess it's time to be moving. Things gone to hell around here.}
