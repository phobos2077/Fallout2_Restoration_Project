{100}{}{You see a tall man with a huge, misshapen belly.}
{101}{}{You see Hakeswill, a Morningstar Mine worker.}
{102}{}{You see a man with jaundiced skin, a scar ringing his neck, and a huge gut.}
{103}{}{Here now. What do you think you're doing?}
{104}{}{Hakeswill will teach you a lesson, 'e will.}
{105}{}{Bloody bugger all of you.}
{106}{}{Show proper respect for your betters.}
{107}{}{Do you love your mother?}
{108}{}{Clear off, you.}
{109}{}{No room 'ere for the likes o' you.}
{110}{}{We know how to handle your kind here.}
{111}{}{Whatcha gawkin' at?}
{112}{}{Move it, you, afore I lose my temper.}
{113}{}{Some day, I'll catch you when you're not lookin'}
{114}{}{You can't kill me. It's been tried before.}
{115}{}{I'll get out of here. You'll see.}
{116}{}{That bitch had it coming to 'er.}
{117}{}{That whore won't be nothing compared to what I do to you.}
{118}{}{I'm saving a flat-headed nail for you, guv.}
{119}{}{I'm bloody, fucking invincible, I am. This place won't hold me long.}
{120}{}{You did what's smart.}
{121}{}{Obidiah's mother loves 'im.}
{122}{}{I'll take care of Lou next.}
{123}{}{You're smarter than you look.}
{124}{}{Damn whores; they're all the same. Where's my razor?}
{125}{}{I hears that someone might want to talk to old Hakeswill. Someone's volunteered to bring
 Obidiah to justice. Is that you?}
{126}{}{I'm looking for the miner that cut Lou's gal. Sounds like you just made a confession to me.}
{127}{}{I'm bringing justice to you in person. 10mm justice, that is.}
{128}{}{It might be. What do you know about the affair?}
{129}{}{No sir, heh, heh. I wouldn't do that. G'goodbye…sir.}
{130}{}{I cut the bitch. She made a mistake, she did.}
{131}{}{A mistake?}
{132}{}{I don't care what she did to you. You're a mad dog, and I'm just the one to put you down.}
{133}{}{You made the mistake, you crazy fuck. I'm taking you to jail until you're tried and hung.}
{134}{}{Taking me to jail? I'll come peaceably. No sense in making more trouble. The bitch still got
 what she deserved. You can't kill me. I'm invincible, but you can sure piss off the other miners. Got
 eyes in the back of your head, do you?}
{135}{}{I can take care of myself. Right now I'm the Sheriff in these here parts, and I'm taking you in.}
{136}{}{On second thought, I have a better idea. Why don't I save the good people of Redding some time
 and trouble by just killing you here and now?}
{137}{}{I'm not sure that I want to upset all the other Morningstar miners. This time I'll let you off
 with a warning. But, if you ever do it again…}
{138}{}{Oh, thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Obidiah'll be careful, sir. Thank you.}
{139}{}{Thank you, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, Obidiah'll be careful, ma'am. Thank you.}
{140}{}{You just make sure that you are careful. I don't want to hear about this sort of thing again.
 Goodbye.}
{141}{}{She made fun o' me Mum. Nobody makes fun o' Hakeswill's Mum. She's the only good thing in this
 whole rotting world.}
{142}{}{I don't care why you did it. You're coming to jail with me. Right now.}
{143}{}{Your Mum should have used more reliable birth control.}
{144}{}{She made fun of your mother? Well, that's not right at all. But you overreacted.}
{145}{}{Well, that I did. But the lads and I here at the Morningstar don't think what she did was right,
 not right at all. But I promise to not do it again.}
{146}{}{Well, I should take you in for slicing off half that girl's face - but as long as you don't make
 a habit of it... I'll let you go, this time.}
{147}{}{I'm sure that the jury will take that into consideration. I'm still taking you in.}
{148}{}{If the other miners have the same brutish inclinations that you do, then they can benefit from
 the painful example that I'm going to make of you.}
