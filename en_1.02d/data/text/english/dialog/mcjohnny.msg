{168}{}{Have you talked to Vegeir about me going home?}
{169}{}{Yes. He says he wants your parents to come down and get you.}
{170}{}{No, not yet.}
{171}{}{My dad said Laddie went with you to look for me. Where is she? I miss her.}
{172}{}{I’m sorry Jonny. Laddie died while we were searching for you.}
{173}{}{Rose said she would look after your dog.}

{180}{}{Very nice to meet you .}
{181}{}{Your mother and father have sent me to find you.}
{182}{}{See you around kid.}
{183}{}{That’s swell! I wanted to go home, but Vegeir says his people can’t travel that far above ground and
 couldn’t take me…Not that I doubt you, but what’s my father’s name?}
{184}{}{Farrel}
{185}{}{Cornelius}

{187}{}{Davin}
{188}{}{Joshua}
{189}{}{Don’t you trust me Jonny?}
{190}{}{Hmm….no. Thank you, for bringing my dog back to me, but I have to go now. Bye.}
{191}{}{It was sure nice meeting you, but I have to go now. Bye.}
{192}{}{That’s right! Yipee! I’m going home. Ask Vegeir if it’s all right for you to take me home. He’s been
 so nice to me, I don’t want to leave until he says it’s all right. Please hurry, I’m homesick.}
{193}{}{Okay mister, I believe you. Ask Vegeir it’s all right for you to take me home. He’s been so nice to
 me, I don’t want to leave until he says it’s all right.}
{194}{}{Okay miss, I believe you. Ask Vegeir it’s all right for you to take me home. He’s been so nice to me,
 I don’t want to leave until he says it’s all right.}
{195}{}{No. I’m going to go play with my friends now. Bye.}
{196}{}{I’m not supposed to talk to strangers. Bye.}
{197}{}{Yes it is! How did you know? Laddie must have told you. She’s such a smart dog.}
{198}{}{Your mother and father have sent me to find you.}
{199}{}{You’re coming with me kid. There’s a reward for bringing you back.}
{200}{}{Yes, I think that’s best. Although I trust you, I’m sure Vegeir just wants to make sure I get home
 safely. Thank you for your help.}
{201}{}{Please hurry. I want to go home.}
{202}{}{No! I don’t believe you! Give me back my dog! [Waaaaa!]}
{203}{}{Oh no! Don’t you know Rose uses dog in her dishes! Laddie is probably a burger by now.}
