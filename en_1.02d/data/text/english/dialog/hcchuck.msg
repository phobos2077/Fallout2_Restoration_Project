{102}{}{You see a dusty, sleepy-looking man. His clothes look very, VERY old fashioned.}
{103}{}{::he rubs sleep from his eyes:: Wha'... huh? Where am I? How long have I been asleep?}

{105}{}{Who are you?}
{106}{}{I have no idea how long you've been asleep, but you're in Broken Hills, near the New California Republic.}
{107}{}{Oh no! I've slept so long the world has turned stupid! Aieeeeeeee! ::he flees in panic::}

{112}{}{Hey, now, wait a second...}
