{100}{}{You see a filthy trapper with torn and bloodstained clothing. He appears to be favoring one leg
 slightly.}
{101}{}{You see Smiley, the trapper. He’s limping a bit and looks unhappy.}
{102}{}{You see Smiley, the trapper. He looks a lot better since you rescued him from the caves.}
{103}{}{You see a middle-aged man wearing the bloody and torn clothes of a trapper. He doesn’t look
 very well.}
{104}{}{You see Smiley, the trapper. He looks as though his health has improved greatly since you
 rescued him from the cave.}

{110}{}{Hello there, stranger. People call me Smiley. I’m sure glad to see you. I thought I was going
 to die here for certain! I'm hurt too bad to get past those damn lizards on my own.}
{111}{}{Smiley, heh, heh, heh. Ook.}
{112}{}{What are you doing here?}
{113}{}{Nice to meet you, Smiley. I think I’ll be going now.}

{120}{}{Great. Another Torr. I (points at himself) need you (points at you) to help me get out of here
 (makes walking fingers motion on hand).}
{121}{}{Go? Now? Ook }
{122}{}{ go. Bad lizards! Bad!}

{130}{}{Yes! That’s it. We go (walking fingers again) together (clasps hands together). Right now!}
{131}{}{Smiley go with }
{132}{}{ now.}
{133}{}{Smiley no go with }
{134}{}{. No like Smiley. Goodbye.}

{140}{}{Hey! Wait! You can’t just leave me here.}
{141}{}{Oh, sorry. What was I thinking?}
{142}{}{Well, I guess not.}
{143}{}{I can and I will. I think I’m going to do just that. Goodbye.}

{150}{}{I always caught more golden geckos north and west of Klamath than anywheres else. So I figured
 that all the golden geckos lived someplace up here.}
{151}{}{Looks like you were right.}

{160}{}{I’d love to chat with you, but let’s just get out of here now and chat later. Okay?}
{161}{}{Uh, yeah. I guess that’s a good idea.}
{162}{}{Just one question, first. What do you know about these caves?}

{170}{}{Looks as though I was a little too right. I got in here okay, but then one of those damn geckos
 got behind me and damn near took my leg off. I just barely made it over here.}
{171}{}{I wonder why they didn’t finish you off?}

{180}{}{Well, I guess they don’t like to crawl through the goo too much. I can’t say as I blame them.
 It sure burns if gets on your skin. But that doesn’t seem to stop ‘em from licking up the darn stuff
 like it was Buckner’s Best.}
{181}{}{Interesting.}

{190}{}{Enough gum flapping. Now let’s get out of here. I figure that if I can join you we should both
 be able to make it out of here okay. I sure could use the help.}
{191}{}{Ok. You can join me. I’ll make sure you get out of here and back to Klamath. I think that Ardin
 is going to be glad to see you again.}
{192}{}{Well, OK. But I don’t want you whining for help all the time.}

{200}{}{These caves look like a prewar storage area. I think there must be more down below us but
 there’s some kind of fancy teck-no-logical lock on the door. Anyhow, I’ve had enough. Let’s git out of
 here.}
{201}{}{OK.}

{210}{}{Whew. I think I just used up some lives that time around. Why don’t you come over to the
 Buckner place a little later on, and I’ll make sure you get a nice reward for saving me.}
{211}{}{Thanks, Smiley. I was happy to do it. Goodbye.}
{212}{}{OK, whatever. Goodbye.}
{213}{}{About time you mentioned a reward. It better be a good one. Goodbye.}

{220}{}{Well, if’n it ain’t my idjit friend. Thanks a heap. Goodbye to you.}
{221}{}{Hello there, friend. Thanks again for getting me out of that tight spot. Anything I can help you
 with?}
{222}{}{Anything else, friend?}
{223}{}{Well, I had a few questions about hunting geckos.}
{224}{}{I have all sorts of questions about this area.}
{225}{}{Is Mrs. Buckner happy to see you back?}
{226}{}{No, I guess I just wanted to say hello. Talk to you later, Smiley. Goodbye.}

{230}{}{I sure owe you for saving my hide. Least I can do is to teach you something in return.}
{231}{}{Teach?}
{232}{}{Thanks Smiley. I'd sure appreciate any tips you could give me.}

{240}{}{Since those geckos nearly had my hide let me teach you how to get theirs. Here's how you skin 'em. (Smiley
 demonstrates) ...and when you kill 'em you can get their hides an' sell 'em. OK?}
{241}{}{Urk. Pretty, heh, heh, heh. Sell. Heh, heh, heh. Bye.}
{242}{}{Thanks, I'm sure that will come in handy. Tell me something else though.}
{243}{}{Thanks for showing me how to do that, Smiley. I think I'll go practice on some geckos. Goodbye.}

{250}{}{I think you know enough about geckos now. }
{251}{}{Heh, heh. I think maybe you could teach me something about geckos. I don’t think I can help you
 out with that.}
{252}{}{Well, I guess I know more about geckos than anyone alive. I was raised on gecko milk, you know.
 But it’ll take a few hours.}
{253}{}{I want to know all you can teach me about geckos.}
{254}{}{I guess I don’t need to know about that right now. Tell me something else though.}
{255}{}{Gecko milk? I thought geckos were reptiles.}

{260}{}{There’s more you need to know than you even know you need.}
{261}{}{Teach me, oh great trapper.}
{262}{}{Uh, yes. Go ahead. I’m listening.}
{263}{}{Well, okay. Spin your tall tales. I’ll listen.}
{264}{}{Maybe I don’t need to know about this. Goodbye.}

{270}{}{Well, you see it’s like this - golden geckos and regular geckos are basically the same critter
 except the golden’s got a big second helping of sheer cussedness... (time passes as you learn the lore
 of the Gecko)}
{271}{}{That was great. I think I know a lot more about geckos now. Thanks. Goodbye.}

{280}{}{Maida Buckner, Widow Buckner’s daughter, is the one to talk to about all sorts of town gossip.}
{281}{}{Let me ask you something else, then.}
{282}{}{Oh, I see. Thanks. Goodbye.}

{290}{}{Widow Buckner’s so darn happy to have me back that she may be Mrs. Smiley before too long. She
 was even talking about giving you a little something for finding my hairy butt and returning it to her.}
{291}{}{I’m happy for the two of you. Let me ask you something else.}
{292}{}{That’s great. I’ll have to talk to her. Goodbye.}

{300}{}{Hey, thanks for saving my sorry ass. I better high-tail it back to Klamath. See you there.}
{310}{}{Don't worry about me. I can make it back from here on my own.}

{320}{}{You gain }
{330}{}{exp. points for rescuing Smiley.}
