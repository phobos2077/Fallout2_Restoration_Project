# 4. Whiskey (From 3)

{302}{}{You okay? You want whiskey? Only $5.}

 all over the world.}

# 6. Why drinks are so cheap (From 5)
{330}{}{Well, since you're such a good customer, I'll let you in on a little secret.
 It's simple really - I have a still. A friend from a nearby town taught me how to
 make one. So, would you like another one?}
{331}{}{Sorry, it's a trade secret. Plus, I don't really know you that well. I wouldn't
 want Frankie finding out. He's enough trouble as it is.  Did you still want one? They
 really hit the spot.}

{334}{}{Okay, thanks.}

{353}{}{Derek borrowed a book of mine a while back. I'll pay $80 if you can get it
 back for me.}

{355}{}{What's the catch?}
{356}{}{Tell me more.}
{357}{}{Can I ask you a question?}
{358}{}{Bye.}

# 9. Job 1 & 2 Introductions (From 8)
{370}{}{Catch? Oh, well, if you knew Fred you'd understand. He's owed me the money
 for quite a long time. I'd written it off as a loss, but if you can get it back, I'd be
 amazed… and grateful. He's somewhere in town, I'm sure.}
{371}{}{The book was The Lavender Flower. Derek should be over around Mom's on the east side.}
{372}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{373}{}{Sure sounds easy.}
{374}{}{I already found it.}
{375}{}{I'll have to get back to you.}

# 10. (From 3, )
{385}{}{You didn't really get it did you? I'd be amazed.}

 middle. Thank you again, that was very honest of you.}

{402}{}{You're welcome.}

# 12. Deaths (From 10)
