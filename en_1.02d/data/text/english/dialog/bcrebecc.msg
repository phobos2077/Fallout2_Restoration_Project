{100}{}{You see an older woman.}
{101}{}{You see Rebecca.}
{102}{}{You see an older woman. Although she appears to have lived a hard life, she has not lost any of
 her natural beauty.}
{103}{}{Hi, I'm Rebecca. Can we talk privately, please?}
{104}{}{What talk about?}
{105}{}{Why need talk private?}
{106}{}{Okay.}
{107}{}{No. Me leave.}
{108}{}{Sorry, not interested.}
{109}{}{What do you want to talk to me about?}
{110}{}{Sure, where can we go for privacy?}
{111}{}{Why the need for privacy?}
{112}{}{(whispering) My daughter is missing and I need help finding her. I can't talk about it here,
 though. Can we go somewhere private?}
{113}{}{Okay.}
{114}{}{Why need talk private?}
{115}{}{No, me go.}
{116}{}{All right, let's go.}
{117}{}{Why the need for privacy?}
{118}{}{No thanks, I don't want to get involved.}
{119}{}{(whispering) You may think I'm crazy but I get the feeling I'm being watched all the time. It's
 rather disturbing, and I'm a bit on edge because of it.}
{120}{}{Okay, we go private.}
{121}{}{No time for sicky in head.}
{122}{}{All right; where can we go to talk?}
{123}{}{Sorry, I don't like the sound of this.}
{124}{}{Thanks; we can go to my tent.}
{125}{}{Okay.}
{126}{}{We should be able to talk here.}
{127}{}{Okay, what problem?}
{128}{}{Me got questions first.}
{129}{}{Okay, so what's so important?}
{130}{}{I have some questions for you, first.}
{131}{}{I have a daughter named Chrissy who's a bit of a tomboy. She likes to run around, explore,
 and pretty much stick her nose into things. Chrissy's a good kid, though. She doesn't
 cause trouble, she's always home on time and she's shown herself to be a very responsible young lady.
 I let her do as she pleases most of the time. Last week Chrissy didn't come home. I've asked
 around, and nobody's seen or heard from her. I tried to find her myself, but Zeke, he's... sort of the
 mayor here... stopped me. He said it wasn't safe for me to go out looking on my own; he'd have some of
 his men do it. They couldn't find her, either, and said that maybe the slavers got her.}
{132}{}{No, not get involved.}
{133}{}{Need think before decide.}
{134}{}{Ok, me seem be hero type lately.}
{135}{}{Sorry, not interested.}
{136}{}{I need to think about this.}
{137}{}{All right, Rebecca. I'll try to help you.}
{138}{}{If I help you, what's in it for me?}
{139}{}{What do you want to know?}
{140}{}{What go on here?}
{141}{}{Who boss?}
{142}{}{Me try find Vault 13. You know where is?}
{143}{}{Tell about vault.}
{144}{}{Tell about Darion.}
{145}{}{Thanks. We talk you problem?}
{146}{}{What's going on around here?}
{147}{}{Who's in charge around here?}
{148}{}{I'm looking for Vault 13. Do you know anything about it?}
{149}{}{Tell me about the vault.}
{150}{}{So tell me about Darion.}
{151}{}{Thanks Rebecca. Let's talk about your problem now.}
{152}{}{We call this place the 'Squat' because it was settled by the homeless of many cities. It's not
 much, but it's all we have. To the west is a city called the NCR. They've known about us for quite some
 time, and never offered us any kind of help or hindrance. Now, they are suddenly claiming this area as their
 ancestral home, and they want it back.}
{153}{}{Okay.}
{154}{}{What here they want?}
{155}{}{I see.}
{156}{}{What is here that they want so badly?}
{157}{}{Well... there is a vault here; I think it's number 15. They want to loot it for any of the old
 technology that may still be there.}
{158}{}{Ah. Me understand.}
{159}{}{I knew there had to be something here other than the waste-of-flesh inhabitants.}
{160}{}{Got it.}
{161}{}{That explains a lot. You've been very helpful. I need to ask some more questions, though.}
{162}{}{That would be Zeke. He runs everything up here. You can find him in the building over there.
 ::points north-east::}
{163}{}{Thanks. Ask more.}
{164}{}{Thank you. I need to ask you some more questions.}
{165}{}{I'm sorry, I have no idea. I would ask about it in NCR. They've taken a great interest in
 vaults lately.}
{166}{}{Okay, me do.}
{167}{}{All right, I will.}
{168}{}{Well... we're not supposed to talk about it, but since I need your help... The vault is being
 repaired by Darion. He's our benefactor. When it's fully functional, we're all supposed to move in
 where we'll be safe from raiders, slavers, and such. So far he has the food and water systems up, but
 that's about it.}
{169}{}{Me see. Need know more.}
{170}{}{I need to know more.}
{171}{}{There's not much to say, really. Darion keeps to himself and never leaves the vault. If he has
 anything to say, he says it through Zeke. I've only met him once, and he seemed like a nice guy.}
{172}{}{Okay.}
{173}{}{Nice guys finish last. I wonder what he's up to?}
{174}{}{I see.}
{175}{}{That's okay. You are very helpful.}
{176}{}{I have nothing to give you other than my undying gratitude.}
{177}{}{That's more than enough. I'll help you.}
{178}{}{It'll take more than that to buy my help.}
{179}{}{What the hell, I'll help you.}
{180}{}{Thank you so much. I'll never be able to repay you for this. I'll wait here until you bring...
 Hey, there was someone outside listening to us! I saw their shadow on the tent wall. They just ran off
 that way! ::points north-east:: They must have heard everything!}
{181}{}{Me stop, no get away!}
{182}{}{You no worry, me find girl.}
{183}{}{Ooops.}
{184}{}{I'll try and stop them.}
{185}{}{They won't stop me from finding your daughter.}
{186}{}{Oh well. Shit happens.}
{187}{}{Please, just go away.}
{188}{}{Have you thought things through?}
{189}{}{Me ask questions.}
{190}{}{No, still think.}
{191}{}{No, I'm still considering everything.}
{192}{}{I want to ask you some questions.}
{193}{}{Have you changed your mind? Will you help me?}
{194}{}{Sorry, no.}
{195}{}{Me help.}
{196}{}{Yes, I'll help you.}
{197}{}{You must be the person who saved my daughter. I can never repay you for your kindness.Thank you.
 Please wait here, I need to talk to Chrissy and then I'd like to talk to you.}
{198}{}{You saved my daughter. I can never repay you for your kindness. Thank you.
 Please wait here, I need to talk to Chrissy and then I'd like to talk to you.}
{199}{}{Okay.}
{200}{}{My daughter has told me everything. I find it hard to believe that Darion is such a monster
 after all he's been doing for us. And to think, we've been helping him hide his operations as a raider.
 I can guarantee you we won't stand for it any longer. I've already talked to Zeke, and he wants to see
 you. You should go see him now.}
{201}{}{I find it hard to believe that Darion is such a monster after all he's been doing for us. And to
 think, we've been helping him hide his operations as a raider. I can guarantee you we won't stand for
 it any longer. I'll talk to Zeke and explain everything. I'm sure he'll want to see you. You should go
 talk to him later.}
{202}{}{Thank you.}
{203}{}{I hope you find Chrissy soon.}
{204}{}{Me looking.}
{205}{}{I'll continue to search for her.}
{206}{}{Thanks for everything you've done for me.}

{207}{}{I can't explain why, but I don't believe the slavers took her. I've an uneasy feeling that
 something else is going on. And then there's this feeling that I'm being followed. I've had it ever
 since I talked to Zeke about Chrissy. I need someone to help me find my daughter. Will you help me,
 please?}
{208}{}{They keep sending people here to try and talk us out of our home, but they don't understand
 that we have nowhere else to go. We don't have the skills necessary to survive on our own if we leave
 here.}
{209}{}{You know, it's kind of funny that they managed to get something that complex fixed, but not the
 lights. The damn place is lit by torches. Anyway, Darion doesn't want anyone to know what's going on
 with the vault. He's afraid that someone will take it all away from us if they find out. So, we're told
 to drive off anyone who shows up here -- especially the NCR.}
