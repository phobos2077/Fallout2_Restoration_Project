{166}{}{You see a metal box talking to the air in a woman's voice. The woman must be inside the box! She must be really, really cramped in there.}
{167}{}{You have logged on to the Vault City Central Computer. The interface seems relatively easy to understand; everything seems to be broken down into archives.}
{168}{}{Hewllo? Hewllo?}
{169}{}{Try and pry open the box so the woman can get out.}
{170}{}{Shamble off}
{171}{}{Search the archives for location of Vault 13.}

{181}{}{You kneel down beneath the metal box. You dig your fingers into one of the boards under the box
 and yank it off. There isn't a woman in there! Just a bunch of dead snakes and sparkling lights.}
{182}{}{Reach in the snakes, feel around.}
{183}{}{Shamble off}
{184}{}{There is a GZZZZTTTTTT and then...}
{185}{}{...you wake up.}
{186}{}{Shamble off}
{187}{}{You pry open the panel beneath the machine and search for a voice recognition module. You don't
 see one...the circuit boards in this computer look much different than the ones in the Vault 13
 computer.}
{188}{}{Replace the panel and look through the computer archives.}
{189}{}{It was worth a shot. Better go look somewhere else.}
{190}{}{As you replace the panel, however, you suddenly notice a small picture of the Pip Boy located
 beneath the terminal. Next to the picture is a slot that looks about the size of your Pip Boy.}
{191}{}{Insert your Pip Boy into the empty slot.}
{192}{}{Leave the terminal.}
{193}{}{As you are about to shamble off, you see the smiling little person from your small blinky Pip
 Boy under the metal box! He's pointing to an empty space next to him. Maybe he wants to talk to your
 Pip Boy little person.}

{196}{}{Insert your Pip Boy into the empty slot.}
{197}{}{Leave the terminal.}
{198}{}{Boy! The two seem to have a LOT to talk about! They talk in funny words that sound like
 grinding, beeping, and mantis-chirping. Eventually, there is a beep, and your Pip Boy slides out.}
{199}{}{Take your Pip Boyeee and leave}
{200}{}{A small window opens on the terminal screen with a smiling Pip Boy next to it. As you watch, the
 Pip Boy starts whistling silently and tapping his feet. A red light is flashing beside the computer slot.}
