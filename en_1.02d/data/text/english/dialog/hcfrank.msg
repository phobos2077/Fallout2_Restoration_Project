{100}{}{You see a scruffy, dirty, angry man.}
{101}{}{You see Franc, one of the local mutant haters.}
{102}{}{You see a scruffy, dirty, angry man, who looks like he’d appreciate nothing more than putting a
 bullet in someone’s head. He carries himself like a rabid animal.}

{103}{}{Whadda you want?}
{104}{}{Aggggg! ::drool::}
{105}{}{You! Me! Go!}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{Why are you in jail?}
{108}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{109}{}{What can you tell me about Marcus?}

{110}{}{I got no idea what you’re saying, freak. Get out of my sight.}
{111}{}{Oooooh…}

{112}{}{I’m Franc. I’d ask who you are, but I don’t care.}
{113}{}{Oh, a tough guy, eh?}
{114}{}{That’s okay. I don’t care who you are, either.}
{115}{}{Yeah, whatever. Bye.}

{116}{}{I’m here because the "man" who runs this place from behind the scenes doesn’t trust me and what
 I’m telling the people of this town. I’m giving the truth about mutants and Marcus doesn’t like it.
 I’m being silenced for my beliefs.}
{117}{}{Sounds harsh.}
{118}{}{Or maybe it’s because you’re a hatemonger who’s trying to scare people into taking out people
 who are different?}
{119}{}{Yeah, that’s interesting. What can you tell me about Broken Hills?}
{120}{}{Suuuure. What can you tell me about Marcus?}
{121}{}{Oookay. Bye.}

{122}{}{Place used to be a paradise. Then the mutants came and turned it into a shithole. Now we’re all
 expected to forget about the past and live peaceful with ‘em. Not me! Live free or die!}
{123}{}{Not quite what I was looking for, but thanks anyway. What can you tell me about Marcus?}
{124}{}{Umm, okay. So long.}

{125}{}{Marcus tells everyone he helped discover the city. He didn’t. It was humans here first, and him
 and his crowd moved in and took over and expected ever’one else to bend over and let the mutants give
 it to ‘em. Marcus is the ringleader of that whole circus.}
{126}{}{You’re really crazy, I think.}
{127}{}{Damn mutants. Just as I thought.}

{128}{}{Yeah, I am a tough guy. If I weren’t in jail, I’d prove it to you. You think you’re tough?
 Think you can prove it, loser?}
{129}{}{Of course.}
{130}{}{I don’t have anything to prove to you, lowlife.}

{131}{}{Get the hell out of my sight, you jerk! I’d kill you if I had the chance!}
{132}{}{Bye.}

{133}{}{The law ‘round here is based on mutant love. Do you hate mutants?}
{134}{}{Yes.}
{135}{}{No.}

{136}{}{Yeah? Then go talk to Jacob, the chemist. I’ll catch you later.}

{137}{}{Mutie-lover! Get outta here! I don’t want to breathe the same air as you!}

{138}{}{You again? What do you want?}
{139}{}{Tell me about Broken Hills.}
{140}{}{Tell me about Marcus.}
{141}{}{Why are you in jail?}

{142}{}{You talked to Jacob? What are you waiting for? Get us outta here!}

{143}{}{Thanks for gettin’ us outta there. Too bad we didn’t get t’ kill anyone before we left.}

{144}{}{Ha! Killin’ those muties was almost worth being in the slammer!}

{145}{}{Just set up the explosive switch, and we'll do the rest.}

{146}{}{Great work, pal. We’re gettin’ outta town. You probably oughta, too. So long!}

{147}{}{You went and screwed that all up! You gotta die now, pal!}

{148}{}{Lets' get out of here.}

{149}{}{Nutting. ByeBye.}
{150}{}{Nevermind. Bye.}

{151}{}{This ain't justice. You oughta be ashamed of yourself.}

{152}{}{Thanks for your help, friend. Let's go talk to Jacob and Aileen.}

{153}{}{You have successfully performed the jailbreak.}

{154}{}{Thanks for your help in the slammer, stranger.}
{155}{}{No problem.}
