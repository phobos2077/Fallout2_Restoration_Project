# 21. WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR JET, JIMMY? (7, 8)
{490}{}{Glad you asked, my pilot friend, glad you asked. See, all them OTHER dealers, right, they get their shit second hand,
 watered down, diluted with all sorts o' shit.}
{491}{}{But your Jet, on the other hand…}
{492}{}{Actually, forget I asked. I had some other questions…}

# 22. WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR JET, JIMMY? (COMPANION: MYRON, NOT IN PARTY) (7, 8)
{500}{}{I used to get it from the god himself, Myron, see, but he up and left...or got aced. Now I mostly peddle straight from the
 Mordino Family.}
{501}{}{Well, I USEDTA get it from ol' Myron, before he got all uppity and left the business…ain't that right, Myron? Ha!
 Now I mostly peddle run-o-the-mill Mordino shit.}
{502}{}{Interesting. I had some other questions…}

# 23. WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR JET, JIMMY? VOL. 2 (8, 22)
{510}{}{Me, I got ties to the CREATOR, my pilot friend. I get my Jet straight from the brainiac, the living god of chem n' compounds,
 MYRON.}
{511}{}{Myron?}
{512}{}{Interesting. Say, I had some other questions…}
{513}{}{Myron, huh? Can I meet this…living god?}
{514}{}{Really? Well, I'll be sure to come back and buy some later on. Thanks, Jimmy.}

# 24. WHO'S MYRON? (23)
{520}{}{He's Family Mordino's golden boy. He MADE Jet. Buying from Jagged Jimmy is like buying from Myron himself, y'hear? That's
 why J-J got the pure Jet. The BEST Jet.}
{521}{}{Sounds good. Let's deal.}
{523}{}{Think I could meet this Myron?}

# 25. CAN YOU TAKE ME TO MYRON? (23, 24)
{530}{}{Hell, no! The Mordinos got that boy locked up tighter than a New Reno virgin. No way they gonna let anybody gonna touch
 their livelihood, know what I'm saying?}
{531}{}{I hear you. So how much security they got on this guy?}
{532}{}{Except that I heard Myron has a lot of prostitute…friends. How does that happen if he's locked up so tight?}
{533}{}{Understood. Say, I had some other questions…}
{534}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information, Jimmy.}

# 26. SECURITY? (25)
{540}{}{Guards, guards, and more guards. Plus, tightest electronic security in New Reno. You'd be lucky if you even HEAR
 about somebody seeing Myron, he's so well-guarded.}
{541}{}{Well-guarded, huh? Where, exactly?}
{543}{}{I see. Say, I had some other questions…}

# 27. STABLES? (26)
{550}{}{They got him stationed at this place called the "Stables," to the North, outside city limits. I only been there
 once - they never let me past the gates, and I WORK for the Family.}
{551}{}{Come on, there must be some way I could see him.}
{554}{}{The Stables, huh? Outside of town to the North…(I'll just record that on the Pip Boy real quick here)…thanks for the
 lowdown, Jimmy.}

# 28. HOW COULD I GET TO SEE MYRON? NO (27)
{560}{}{Beats the hell outta me, friend. I SELL for the boy, and I ain't hardly see him but once or twice from a hundred yards
 away. Big Jesus Mordino don't let nobody near him who ain't tight with the family.}
{561}{}{All right then, let's deal.}
{564}{}{All right then. Thanks, Jimmy. I got to be going.}

# 29. ANY WAY I COULD GET TO SEE MYRON? (25, 26, 27, 28)
{570}{}{Now, that's a…hole…different story, my pilot friend. Oh my, yes.}
{571}{}{I think this is a story I want to hear. C'mon, Jimmy…}
{572}{}{Nevermind. I had some other questions…}
{573}{}{I don't think I have time for this story, Jimmy. I got to be going.}

# 30. ANY WAY I COULD GET TO SEE MYRON 2? (29)
{580}{}{See, Myron is well taken care of…Mordinos give their little livelihood the BEST of New Reno.}
{581}{}{And by that, you mean…?}
{582}{}{You mean prostitutes, don't you? Out of idle curiosity, where do the Mordinos get these prostitutes and how are they chosen?}
{584}{}{I see. Thanks, Jimmy. I got to be going.}

# 31. ANY WAY I COULD GET TO SEE MYRON 2? (30)
{590}{}{Th' Mordinos deliver whores to the Stables personally, then escort them out again. Heh-heh. Myron's barely nineteen, and
 he's got the hormones o' twenty…twenty MEN, that is.}
{592}{}{Interesting….say, out of IDLE curiosity, where do the Mordinos get these prostitutes and how are they selected?}

# 32. HOW DOES MORDINO SELECT THESE PROSTITUTES? (30, 31)
{600}{}{(Shrugs.) One of Mordino's boys cruises the Cat's Paw down the street, I hear, picks one Myron might like from Miss Kitty's
 stock…(Jimmy suddenly stops talking. He squints at you and frowns.) Wait a minute...}
{601}{}{What's wrong?}
{602}{}{Uh…nevermind. Say, I had some other questions…}
{603}{}{Uh, well, thanks for the information, Jimmy.}

# 33. HOW DOES MORDINO SELECT THESE PROSTITUTES? (32)
{610}{}{Why you want to know shit like that? I got Jet, that's all YOU need to know. You don't need to know nothing about Myron,
 or what he had for dinner, or who he does 'fore he goes to bed at night.}
{611}{}{Why you want to know shit like that… (Pauses, then smiles and looks you up and down.) Aw, now I catch your drift.
 You gonna go straight to the source for yo Jet, right, sister?}
{612}{}{Not at the moment. Let's see what you got, Jimmy.}
{613}{}{Forget it, then. Let's deal.}
{614}{}{Nevermind then. I had some other questions…}
{615}{}{I might. Say, I had some other questions…}
{616}{}{No, just curious. Thanks, Jimmy. I got to be going.}
{617}{}{All right then. Later, Jimmy. I got to be going.}

# 36. YOU SAYING HE SELLS SHIT THAT KILLS PEOPLE? (7, 8, 43)
{625}{}{Hell, all's I'M sayin' is Jimmy likes his buyers happy and ALIVE. Draw yer own conclusions, my pilot friend.
 Is breathin' more important to you than shaving a few chips off your next Jet purchase?}
{626}{}{Understood. We gonna deal?}
{627}{}{Know anything about this empty Jet canister?}
{628}{}{I don't think the kid ODed on Jet. I think he was poisoned.}
{629}{}{I had some other questions…}

# 37. YOU KNOW ABOUT WRIGHT KID'S OD? (7, 8)
{635}{}{Aw, so NOW it comes out, does it?! You wanna know if ol' Jimmy got something to do with that, huh?!}
{636}{}{No, I was just ask --}
{637}{}{All right, nevermind that. We gonna deal?}

# 38. YOU KNOW ABOUT WRIGHT KID'S OD? (37)
{645}{}{FUCK you! I sell CLEAN shit! You wanna know who poisoned that Wright kid, you go ask that old fool Renesco, or that
 weasel Jules, and you see what they say!}
{646}{}{Okay, okay. Calm down --}
{648}{}{All right, all right. Look, I had some other quest --}

# 39. TRY AND LEAVE (38)
{655}{}{You listen, and you listen GOOD. If I hear you were talkin' shit 'bout me havin' anything to do with that Wright kid's
 death, I'll make sure you have a grave in Golgotha right next to him.}
{656}{}{Renesco said you sell Jet laced with arsenic.}
{659}{}{No problem. Look, I had some other questions…}
{660}{}{Dead, huh? Like Richard?}
{661}{}{Don't you threaten ME, you little cocksucker. Mess with me, and I'll kill you so many times you'll
 think you were Lazarus.}
{662}{}{Easy, Jimmy. Nobody's going to be talking.}
{663}{}{I'm not going to say anything, Jimmy. I'm going now, see? I'm going.}

# 40. CANISTER 1 (36, 39)
{675}{}{(Takes canister, studies it.) Naw, I... (Sniffs nozzle, then frowns.) Sheeee-it. This Jet's got radscorp juice in it.
 Whoever was sucking on this ain't long for this world... (Hands canister back.)}
{676}{}{It's poisoned?}
{677}{}{Hmmm. I had some other questions…}
{678}{}{I see. Thanks.}

# 41. CANISTER 2 (40)
{685}{}{Hell, yes! Gotta be careful in this town with shit like that being passed around...that's why Jimmy always says --}
{686}{}{Any idea where this might have come from?}

# 42. ANY IDEA . . . (41)
{695}{}{Naw, I don't...look, now, don't be spreading the word that's mine...if I were you, I'd ask Jules and Renesco
 about it...but you didn't hear that from me, right?}
{696}{}{All right then. I had some other questions…}
{697}{}{Renesco and Jules, huh? I'll ask them about it. Thanks for the tip.}

# 43. ANY IDEA . . . (36, 39)
{705}{}{Don't surprise me none.}
{706}{}{What are you saying?}
{707}{}{I see. I had some other questions…}
{708}{}{Nevermind, then.}

# 44. ANY IDEA . . . (39)
{715}{}{Yeah, he WOULD say that, cause he knows ALL about it.}
{716}{}{What do you mean?}

# 45. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? (7, 8, 44)
{725}{}{What do I mean? I mean Jimmy likes his buyers happy and ALIVE. Renesco don't draw no distinctions 'tween the two,
 though...so YOU draw yer own conclusions, my pilot friend.}
{727}{}{Thanks for the tip, Jimmy. I'd better be going now.}
