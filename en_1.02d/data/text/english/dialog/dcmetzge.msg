{101}{}{You see Metzger, the slaver master.}

{150}{}{Metzger's the head of the Slaver's Guild.}

# 1. CF: Hostile (From WTG)
{200}{}{You'll pay for that.}

# 2. 1st Time, Self Initiated (From 2-WTG)
{210}{}{What the fuck do you want? This is the Slaver's Guild not some safe
 house for you fucking jet heads.}
{211}{}{What the hell do you want, you ugly bitch? This is the Slaver's
 Guild not some fucking whorehouse.}
{212}{}{What the hell do you want, bitch? This is the Slaver's Guild not some
 fucking whorehouse.}
{213}{}{You're starting to piss me off. What the hell do you want now?}
{214}{}{Now what, damn it?}
{215}{}{What?}
{216}{}{Oh, you better make it quick.}
{217}{}{You here to work for a fucking change?}
{218}{}{I'm starting to get used to your ugly mug. So... are you here for a reason or what?}
{219}{}{Do I look like your fucking dad or something? I sure as hell hope not. Now spit it
 out, what do you want?}
{220}{}{Oh, look who's here. You think you're special or something? Speak up or get the
 fuck out.}
{221}{}{What do you want now, slaver?}
{222}{}{You just going to stand there or are you going to say something?}
{223}{}{Speak up. I don't have all day for this crap.}

# 3. Selling NPC (From 5, 13)
{230}{}{Oh, and 'who' would that be? I hope you don't plan on seeing this person again...}
{231}{}{You don't have anyone that I'm interested in. I'm only interested in people -
 normal ones, that is.}
{232}{}{You fucking moron, what do you think I am, a fucking store or something? If you get
 a slave you'd like to sell, let me know. If you want to sell something else, go to a fucking store.}
{233}{}{Miria}
{234}{}{Davin}
{235}{}{Vic}
{236}{}{Myron}

{249}{}{Shoot.}
{250}{}{Maybe.}

# 5. Main body, yes? (From 3)
{255}{}{I have something I'd like to sell.}
{256}{}{About Vic…}
{257}{}{I'm looking for a merchant.}
{258}{}{Lara wanted me to ask you for permission to fight Tyler.}
{259}{}{Can I join the guild?}

{261}{}{I'd like to go on a slave run.}
{262}{}{Never mind. Bye.}
{263}{}{ want to ill.}
{264}{}{Na.}

# 6. Want to join slaver's guild? (From 5, 7, 8)
{270}{}{You think you can cut it? I don't take in just anyone... What the hell. If
 you fuck up, I'll sell you off. You'll have to get a tattoo on your forehead
 identifying you as a slaver to everyone. It's permanent, so no second thoughts.}
{271}{}{So, our delicate little flower girl returns… You changed your mind then?
 Going to get that tat after all?}
{272}{}{Yeah, you might do... You don't need much in the way of brains to go on a run.
 If you fuck up, I'll just sell you off. If you think you can cut it you'll have
 to get a tattoo on your forehead identifying you to everyone as slaver.}
{273}{}{Let's do it.}
{274}{}{I have to think about it. I'll get back to you.}
{275}{}{Maybe not. Bye.}
{276}{}{Uya! [nod]}
{277}{}{No no no no no!}

# 7. Tell me about Guild (From 4)
{285}{}{What do you fucking think? This is a slaving guild. I buy and sell slaves.}
{286}{}{Where do you get the slaves?}
{287}{}{I'd like to join.}
{288}{}{Another question please.}
{289}{}{Oh, okay. Bye.}

# 8. Slaves from? (From 7)
{300}{}{Oh, here and there. We mainly collect primitives and nomads when we run across them.}
{301}{}{Sounds like fun. How can I get in on that?}
{302}{}{I have another question.}
{303}{}{Oh, okay. Bye.}

# 9. Self Initiated, Just got Tattoo (From WTG)
{310}{}{What do you know, you didn't even cry. I'm so proud of you... actually, that tat
 looks pretty good on you. Just give a holler when you're ready for your first slave run.}
{311}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{312}{}{I'm ready right now.}
{313}{}{Me Kill NOW!}
{314}{}{Okey-Dokey}

# 10. Slave Run (From 9)
{320}{}{Two of my men will get you fairly close to your targets. Your pay will be based
 on the number of the slaves you return, but watch each other's backs. If anyone
 gets killed, your pay will be severely cut.}
{321}{}{Damn, we're all farmed out. Have to wait for some primitives to move back into the
 area. Maybe we should start breeding them.}
{322}{}{Sorry, you're just not working out. Too many losses and this is a business. I need
 to make money, not lose it.}
{323}{}{All right. They're ready.}
{324}{}{Good, you can leave now.}
{325}{}{Get a move on it then.}
{326}{}{Good. See me when you're done.}
{327}{}{Okay.}
{328}{}{Uh.}

# 11. Slave Run Description (From 10)
{340}{}{Just kill all the hostile ones. If they attack you, kill them. I don't
 want to deal with them anymore, too big of a fucking hassle. Once you're done,
 the other slavers will round up and tag the rest.}
{341}{}{Okay.}
{342}{}{Oh.}

# 12. Slave Run Description 2 (From 11)
{350}{}{Once they start tagging the slaves, you can head back if you like. It takes
 special training, so don't try to subdue the others yourself. You can do whatever
 you want just as long as you don't damage the goods.}
{351}{}{All right.}
{352}{}{Uh huh.}

# 13. Selling other NPCs (From 3)
{360}{}{Ah, yeah. She's pretty nice. I'll give you $}
{1360}{}{ for her. How about it?}
{361}{}{He's okay. I could probably take him off your hands for, oh, say $}
{1361}{}{?}
{362}{}{You fucking idiot. What the hell makes you think I want that moron back? It took
 him forever to fix a damn radio! A radio! You're stuck with him. I don't want him
 breaking anything else around here.}
{363}{}{I don't know this one's pretty skinny... but a smart one? That might be worth something. I'll give you $}
{1363}{}{.}
{364}{}{This one looks like he could really put up a fight. Hmm… $}
{1364}{}{.}
{365}{}{Another primitive. This one's a freak show. Still, he looks strong and that look might fetch something extra. $}
{1365}{}{?}
{366}{}{How about someone else?}
{367}{}{Well, let me ask you another question then}
{368}{}{Okay.}
{369}{}{Fine.}
{370}{}{Okay.}
{371}{}{Not worth it.}
{372}{}{No.}

# 14. NPC Sold SPECIAL DIALOG (From 13)
{380}{}{All right, boys, put him in the pens.}
{381}{}{All right, boys, put her in the pens.}
{382}{}{Right, boss.}

# 15. Turned down Selling NPC (From 13)
{390}{}{Well don't waste my fucking time then. If you ever get something you're
 looking to part with, come see me.}
{391}{}{I've got another question for you.}
{392}{}{Okay. Bye.}

# 16. Permission (From 5)
{400}{}{What the hell crawled up her ass all of a sudden? I gave that bitch a chance
 a while back. Didn't think she had the balls to try this.}
{401}{}{What are you talking about?}
{402}{}{So it's okay?}

# 17. What kind of outfit… (From 16)
{410}{}{Oh, don't play coy with me. I know exactly what she's planning to do. I
 gave her a chance a while back and she couldn't cut it, but if she
 thinks she's up to it...}
{411}{}{So, it's okay?}

# 18. So it's okay? (From 17)
{420}{}{Well, I did say the offer would remain open. If she finally thinks she can kick his ass and
 is better able to guard my shit...}
{421}{}{Well?}
{422}{}{So, that's a yes?}

# 19. Permission Granted (From 18)
{430}{}{Look, I don't give a shit which of them guards it. Just as long as none of my goods are
 damaged, I don't care.}
{431}{}{Another question, please.}
{432}{}{Okay, thanks.}

# 20. I'm looking for a Merchant (From 5, 20)
{440}{}{What the fuck are you asking me for? Do I look like some kind of fucking… oh,
 wait. You're probably looking for Vic?}
{441}{}{He's the one that 'specializes' in vault technology, or so he says. He's my
 property now. He's not going anywhere.}
{442}{}{What about him?}
{443}{}{Yeah, that's him.}
{444}{}{Can I see him?}
{445}{}{Why are you keeping him here?}
{446}{}{Okay, thanks. Bye.}

# 21. Radio Fix/Not Fixed (From 20)
{455}{}{That little fuck - he sold me a radio that he said would be able to pick up
 some transmissions. It didn't. I caught his ass trying to sneak out of town before
 I found out. Bad mistake. No one fucks with me. He's lucky to be alive.}
{456}{}{Like I said. He needs to fix something first. After that we'll see.}
{457}{}{Well he's finally gotten that damn radio to work, but it doesn't mean I'm going to let
 him off that easy.}
{458}{}{He still tried to screw me over.}
{459}{}{Can I see him?}
{460}{}{What kind transmissions are you talking about?}
{461}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{462}{}{Maybe some money might help clear things up?}
{463}{}{What kind transmissions were you talking about before?}

# 22. Set See Vic is Okay (From 20-21)
{475}{}{What for? Ah, fuck, never mind. Just don't keep him from fixing that damn
 radio - and he better fix it soon. I'm sick of feeding his lazy ass.}
{476}{}{Why are you keeping him here?}
{477}{}{Thanks.}

# 23. Transmissions (From 21)
{485}{}{The Enclave and New… hey. What the hell you care for? It's business. I need to be sure no one's trying to fuck me over. That's all you need to know.}
{486}{}{Mind your own business.}
{487}{}{Okay.}

# 24. Pay for Vic (From 21, 23)
{495}{}{Sure, but it'll cost you $}
{496}{}{$}
{1496}{}{.}
{497}{}{Can't we work something out?}
{498}{}{Okay. Here.}
{499}{}{Can I ask you some more questions first.}
{500}{}{Sorry, can't afford that yet.}

# 25. Bought Vic (From 24)
{510}{}{Okay, he's yours, but get his ass out of here before I change my mind
 and put a bullet in that stupid fucking head of his.}
{511}{}{Can I ask you some more questions first?}
{512}{}{Thank you.}

# 26. Female Sex (From 24)
{520}{}{Oh, yes. We can work everything out nice and smooth... I'll give you
 half off if you make it worth my while...}
{521}{}{You had best stop teasing me, girly. I'm not much with patience.}
{522}{}{Only if you're good to me.}
{523}{}{Sure, why not.}
{524}{}{Maybe later.}

# 27. Good to me (From 26)
{530}{}{Oh, you better believe it.}
{531}{}{Good.}

# 28. Paying for Run (From WTG)
{540}{}{Here's $}
{1540}{}{. Pretty fucking good job .}
{2540}{}{.}
{541}{}{Here's your $}

{545}{}{Well it's $}
{1545}{}{ this time. Pretty good job.}
{546}{}{It wasn't that tough, now was it? Next time no mistakes. Here's $.}
{1546}{}{.}

{551}{}{You want to make any money or not? You're pissing me off. How fucking
 hard can it be? Now take your $.}
{1551}{}{ and get out.}
{552}{}{What the hell was your problem? You don't earn shit this time. We're
 in this to make money, not dick around.}
{553}{}{I'll do better next time.}
{554}{}{Thanks for nothing.}
{555}{}{Thanks}
{556}{}{Ug.}

# 29. (From WTG)
{570}{}{Damn bitch, was that your first time? There's no way that was not your first time.}
{571}{}{Damn girl, was that your first time?}
{572}{}{Pretty good, I guess.}
{573}{}{Very nice, maybe we can do it again sometime.}
{574}{}{Damn! That was... very well spent money.}
{575}{}{Damn! You were the best piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had a lot.}

# 43. Abandon Slave Run
{600}{}{YOU STUPID FUCK! How dare you abandon your fellow slavers out there. [Spits in your face] KILL HIM!}
{601}{}{But I...}
{602}{}{Alright, let's do this.}

# 30. Returned from run, attacked slaver and lived to tell about it. (From WTG)
{620}{}{Well, nice to see you could make it back.}
{621}{}{Yeah, it was a tough run.}
{622}{}{Thanks. Things got a little harry out there.}
{623}{}{Agra Moo ne!}

# 31. Dumb hostile run (From 30)
{630}{}{Oh, you want money? You want to be paid?}
{631}{}{Yah.}
{632}{}{Ugh.}

# 32. Dumb 2 (From 31)
{640}{}{Of course I'd LOVE to help you out but… there's this slight problem I have… something about attacking one of my men.}
{641}{}{Sorry! I didn't mean to- I mean… Ug?}
{642}{}{Uh, oh.}

# 33. Dumb 3 (From 32)
{650}{}{Oh, don't worry. I'm sure I can find it in my heart to pay- I mean repay you. Men, it's payday.}
{651}{}{Oh, don't worry. I'm sure I can find it in my heart to pay- I mean repay you. Men,
 take this bitch down.}
{652}{}{Oops.}
{653}{}{Garaka!}
{654}{}{Uh… Tank?}

# 34. Tough run, hostile (From 30)
{670}{}{Oh, I'm sure. This line of work isn't to be take lightly. It takes trust and loyalty. We watch each other's backs. Good policy don't you think?}
{671}{}{I guess.}
{672}{}{Uh, what's going on?}
{673}{}{Definitely.}

# 35. I guess (From 34)
{680}{}{You guess? I didn't think you were that smart. You really are a stupid fuck.
 [Metzger glares at you then looks to his guards and motions in your direction.]}
{681}{}{Actions?}
{682}{}{What?}

# 36. What's going on? (From 34)
{690}{}{Oh, so you aren't as dumb as you act. Well, that's a shame. You see, I'm having a bit of a dilemma. Someone had the nerve to attack my men.}
{691}{}{Really?}
{692}{}{It was an accident!}

# 37. Definitely (From 34)
{700}{}{Really? I'm so glad you agree. Now what would you do if someone betrayed this trust?}
{701}{}{Uh, give them a warning?}
{702}{}{Here. Let me show you. [attack]}
{703}{}{Make them pay.}

# 38. Trust, warn? (From 37)
{710}{}{You think so? Honestly? I don't know. I was thinking of something a little more… permanent. [With an evil grin, Metzger looks to his guards and nods.]}
{711}{}{What?}
{712}{}{Oh boy…}

# 39. Trust Pay? (From 37)
{720}{}{I'm glad we're in agreement. [Metzger looks to his guards.] Men, it's payday.}
{721}{}{Uh…}

# 40. Really? (From 36)
{730}{}{Yes. It's a shame really. This person just doesn't seem to get it, but
 I think they are about to. [You see Metzger making a small hand gesture to his
 men.] Play time.}
{731}{}{Oh really?}
{732}{}{Uh oh.}

# 41. Accident? (From 36)
{740}{}{Yes, I'm afraid accidents happen around here quite often. In fact, I'm afraid we're about to have another one. [Metzger smiles pleasantly and then nods towards his men.]}
{741}{}{Bring it on!}
{742}{}{I'm not getting out of this am I?}

# 42. Getting out? (From 41)
{750}{}{Oh, but this will be fun. Trust me.}
{751}{}{Fuck you.}
{752}{}{Uh, okay.}

{800}{}{You've killed the leader of the Slave Guild.}
