{100}{}{Greetings, human. I am the warrior Xarn. Are you to be my executioner?}
{101}{}{Yes.}
{102}{}{No, me here rescue you.}
{103}{}{Not know. Me want know why you here.}
{104}{}{Yes I am.}
{105}{}{No, I'm here to rescue you.}
{106}{}{I don't know. I'd like to know why you are here.}

{107}{}{So be it. I do not intend to go quietly, human. Let us make this a
 battle to remember!}
{108}{}{Okay.}
{109}{}{Wait. Me change mind. Why are you here?}
{110}{}{I'm ready. Let's party.}
{111}{}{Wait a minute. Why are you here?}

{112}{}{I find it hard to believe that an Enclave soldier is here to rescue me.
 More likely, you are here to build up my hopes so that you can dash them to pieces.}
{113}{}{No. Me here rescue you. Really.}
{114}{}{Look, I really am here to rescue you!}

{115}{}{You are my last hope so I will place my trust in you. That
 door over there leads to an airshaft that exits into the woods above.
 I should be able to climb the shaft and gain my freedom. However,
 the door is securely locked and requires a passkey to open.
 Find the key, unlock the door, and grant me my freedom.}
{116}{}{Okay, me do.}
{117}{}{Me think about it.}
{118}{}{Sure, I'll do it.}
{119}{}{I'll think about it.}

{120}{}{(Xarn stares at you intently for a moment) Very well.
 The Enclave created my people as a slave warrior race. They
 enhanced our intellect hoping we could better understand their
 commands, and yet not recognize our status as slaves.
 They failed; we are much more intelligent than they suspect.}
{121}{}{We decided to play the fool until we could gain our
 freedom. Our chance arrived when the Enclave decided to test
 us outside their control, here on the mainland. Doctor Schreber
 opposed their decision, but he was overruled.}
{122}{}{Not accepting the Enclave decision, he chose exile to this base,
 captured me, and has been performing experiments to determine my
 true nature. He has been successful. When he reports his findings
 to the Enclave my people will be hunted down and slain. I must
 escape and warn my people.}
{123}{}{(Xarn stares at you intently for a moment) I have nothing
 to tell you, human. I can sense the darkness of your soul.}
{124}{}{If doctor such threat why you no kill?}
{125}{}{Screw you then. Me shoot you ass.}
{126}{}{If this guy is such a threat, then why didn't you just kill him?}
{127}{}{Up yours, then. Die, deathclaw.}

{128}{}{(sigh) Recently I began to consider just such an action,
 even though it is not my way to kill. I am certain the doctor
 noticed because he stopped seeing me in person. The choice is
 no longer mine to make.}
{129}{}{You not worry. Doctor dead. He not make report.}
{130}{}{Me thank you for story.}
{131}{}{You don't have to worry. The doc is dead and he
 didn't make the report.}
{132}{}{Thanks for the story. It was interesting.}

{133}{}{I am sorry to hear of his death but it is for the
 better that this is so. I would ask you to help me escape
 this place. Will you?}
{134}{}{Yes, me do.}
{135}{}{Me think about it.}
{136}{}{No, me no think so.}
{137}{}{Yeah, I'll do it.}
{138}{}{No, but I'll think about it.}
{139}{}{No, I don't think so.}

{140}{}{Very well... I will wait here until you come to a decision.}
{141}{}{Done.}

{142}{}{Very well... I am saddened by your decision but it is
 your choice. If you change your mind, I will be here.}
{143}{}{Bye.}
{144}{}{Goodbye.}

{145}{}{I would ask you to help me escape this place. Will you?}
{146}{}{Yes, me do.}
{147}{}{Me think about it.}
{148}{}{No, me no think so.}
{149}{}{Yeah, I'll do it.}
{150}{}{No, but I'll think about it.}
{151}{}{No, I don't think so.}

{152}{}{Hello again. Are you ready for our battle?}
{153}{}{No want fight, want hear you story.}
{154}{}{Me not want fight. Me here rescue you.}
{155}{}{No. Me go.}
{156}{}{Yes. Me ready.}
{157}{}{I don't really want to fight. Can I hear your story instead?}
{158}{}{I'm here to rescue you, not fight.}
{159}{}{No. I'll be leaving now.}
{160}{}{All right, let's get it over with.}

{161}{}{Hello again. Have you changed your mind? Will you help me?}
{162}{}{Yes.}
{163}{}{No.}

{164}{}{Hello again. Have you changed your mind? Will you help me?}
{165}{}{Yes.}
{166}{}{No. Me still think about it.}
{167}{}{No. Me not help.}
{168}{}{No, I'm still thinking.}
{169}{}{I don't want to help you.}

{170}{}{Hello again. Have you found the key to the door?}
{171}{}{Yes, me open for you.}
{172}{}{Me still look.}
{173}{}{Yeah, I've got it. I'll open the door for you.}
{174}{}{I'm still looking.}

{175}{}{Thank you. I will not forget this.}
{176}{}{You welcome.}
{177}{}{You are welcome.}

{178}{}{Thank you again, my friend. I owe you a debt that can not be repaid.}

{179}{}{Greetings, human. The base is on full alert. Are you by any chance the cause?}
{180}{}{Hello again. The base is on full alert. Are you the cause?}
{181}{}{Yes, me cause. Who you, why you want know?}
{182}{}{Yes, me cause. Why?}

{183}{}{I am Xarn, pack warrior. Allow me to join you and fight at your side for our freedom. Together we stand a chance; alone... who knows?}
{184}{}{Then allow me to join you and fight at your side. Together
 we may be able to gain our freedom; alone... who knows?}
{185}{}{Before me decide you tell why you here?}
{186}{}{Uh... okay. You come me. We fight way out together.}
{187}{}{You on you own. Me out of here.}
{188}{}{Before I come to any decision I'd like to know why you're here?}
{189}{}{Fine. We're in this together. Load up your claws and let's party down!}
{190}{}{You're on your own pal. I'm out of here.}

{191}{}{Uh... okay. You come me. We fight way out together.}
{192}{}{You on you own. Me out of here.}
{193}{}{Fine. We're in this together. Load up your claws and let's party down!}
{194}{}{You're on your own pal. I'm out of here.}

{195}{}{I thank you, human. Let us kick some Enclave ass! Pack Gruthar! Grrrrrrrhh!}
{196}{}{Okay.}

{200}{}{[More]}
{201}{}{Yes. Who are you?}
{202}{}{Yes. Why?}
{300}{}{Very well. The Enclave created my people as a slave warrior race.
 They enhanced our intellect hoping we could better understand their
 commands, and yet not recognize our status as slaves. They failed; we are
 much more intelligent than they suspect.}
{301}{}{We decided to play the fool until we could gain our freedom. Our
 chance arrived when the Enclave decided to test us outside their control, here
 on the mainland. Doctor Schreber opposed their decision, but he was overruled.}
{302}{}{Not accepting the Enclave decision, he chose exile to this base, captured
 me, and has been performing experiments to determine my true nature. He has
 been successful. When he reports his findings to the Enclave my people will be
 hunted down and slain. I must escape and warn my people.}

{500}{}{You are a true Pack brother. May we meet again in more peaceful times.
 I must go now to prepare my people for war.}
{501}{}{I am going to tear off your limbs and beat you with them.}
{502}{}{Die, treacherous human!}
{503}{}{This will hurt you a lot more than it does me.}

{600}{}{Together we will crush our enemies.}
{601}{}{You line 'em up and I'll knock 'em down.}
{602}{}{Time for some serious head bashing.}

{700}{}{You see a deathclaw. It watches you with strangely intelligent eyes.}
{701}{}{You see Xarn, the deathclaw.}
{702}{}{You see a typical deathclaw. The creature is huge, with a powerful body, sharp teeth, and long claws.}

{800}{}{You killed Xarn.}
{810}{}{You freed Xarn.}
{820}{}{You joined Xarn.}
