{104}{}{Just before a big storm we hurl spears into the sea to show our bravery against the elements.
 If we have proven ourselves worthy, the Goddess rewards us with fruit.}
{105}{}{When the season of storms begins, we throw Broc flowers out on the sea with the tide.  After
 the Goddess works her magic, she returns the Broc flowers as the rare Xander root. }
{106}{}{We offer tribute to the Goddess of the Sea each year in the form of Xander root.  If the
 Goddess deems us worthy, she will turn the Xander root into Broc flowers. }
{107}{}{After a bountiful harvest, we give tribute to the Goddess of the Sea that she might watch over
 and protect us.  Every year she has rewarded our piety by sending spears on the tide as sign that she
 is watching over us.}
