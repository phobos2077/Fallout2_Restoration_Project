{100}{}{You see a short, spry gentleman.}
{101}{}{You see Micky, the treasure hunter.}
{102}{}{This very short man looks friendly and brave. His gaze darts around as if looking for shiny objects.}
{103}{}{Hey there, friend! Haven't seen any jewels or precious metals lying around anywhere, have ya'?}
{104}{}{Once again, you generously grace me with your presence. Any hidden treasure caches lying about that I should be aware of?}
{105}{}{So, any riches you need tracked down? I'm the best of the best!}
{106}{}{No trezhuur tooday.}
{107}{}{Yah. Need yur help.}
{108}{}{Who U?}
{109}{}{Bye.}
{110}{}{No, not today. If I run across any, I'll let you know, though.}
{111}{}{Well, yes, actually. I think you'd be the perfect partner for a, shall we say, "joint venture.".}
{112}{}{What's your name?}
{113}{}{Never mind.}
{114}{}{Me? I'm Micky, suave and debonaire Treasure Hunter of Broken Hills.}
{115}{}{Hunnterr?}
{116}{}{Bye-bye.}
{117}{}{Treasure Hunter?}
{118}{}{How nice. Good day.}
{119}{}{Don't tell me you haven't heard of me! You've never been told of the tales of the Fast Micky? Of his
 running gun battles, two-fisted action, and pernicious plunderings?}
{120}{}{Nup.}
{121}{}{I'm afraid I've never had the pleasure.}
{122}{}{Well, you're missing out, friend. One of these days I'll have to fill you in on the gory details.}
{123}{}{Goodeee.}
{124}{}{I'll be waiting with bated breath.}
{125}{}{Oh well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. The market for Treasure Hunters has really dropped in recent
 years. The whole death and famine and fight-for-survival thing really hurts people's sense of adventure. Keep me
 in mind, though, if anything comes up.}
{126}{}{Okee-dokee.}
{127}{}{You'll be the first on my list.}
{128}{}{Really?! That's great! What'll it be? Gold? Jewels? Sacred artifacts?}
{129}{}{Lotsa cash.}
{130}{}{Nebbermind.}
{131}{}{Apparently, a good bit of cash. Enough to live comfortably on for a long while.}
{132}{}{Well, actually, I think I'll work on it myself for a little longer.}
{133}{}{Wow! This is the break I've been waiting for. Whadda' ya say? Are we partners 50/50?}
{134}{}{Yahh!}
{135}{}{Nup. Bye}
{136}{}{Oh, you bet.}
{137}{}{On second thought, I think I'll see if I can't get it myself. See you later.}
{138}{}{Excellent! So what's the story? Where are the bad guys? Whadda' ya want me to do?}
{139}{}{Come wiff me! Go in dark place.}
{140}{}{Let's just say, you'll be spending some time in the local "caverns".}
{141}{}{Sweet! Just point me in the right direction!}
{142}{}{Where trezhur? Downtown?}
{143}{}{Well, I'm not really sure yet. I was told that I might find some treasure around here.}
{144}{}{What? In the downtown area? Ha! Whoever told you that is either lying or insane. With
 the exception of some of the more foul and dank localities of Broken Hills, I've been all
 through this entire town and I haven't found a thing. I'm actually thinking of moving on.}
{145}{}{Too baadd. Bye-Bye.}
{146}{}{That's too bad. I was really hoping for some pointers. Well, bye.}
