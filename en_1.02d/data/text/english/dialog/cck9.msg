{105}{}{Okay. Me like doggie.}
{106}{}{No. Not want doggie.}
{107}{}{Ha! A talking dog.}
{108}{}{One; I am a dog. Two; I am communicating with you vocally using the common
 English language. Therefore it is safe to assume that the answer to your question
 is 'yes, doggie talk.' Now, do you intend to answer the question that I posed to
 you a moment ago?}

{113}{}{(sigh) Pay attention. Concentrate. Look me in the eyes. Now, are you ready?}
{114}{}{Ready what?}
{115}{}{Yes. Me ready.}
{116}{}{I... If it were not for the fact that your IQ is less than my height in
 feet I would think that you are trying to irritate me. Now, be silent. Pay
 attention. Concentrate. Look me in the eyes. I am about to ask you a question.}
{117}{}{So go ahead. Who stopping you?}
{118}{}{The life functions of my master have terminated. Are you my new master?}
{119}{}{Uh... doggie talk?}
{120}{}{Yes. Me want doggie.}
{121}{}{No thanks.}
{122}{}{Sounds good.}
{123}{}{No thanks.}
{124}{}{I... I refuse to go through this with you a second time! Were I
 capable of full motivation I would bite you in the fleshy part of your
 anterior region commonly referred to as the...}
{125}{}{Ass. Me know what ass is. Me not dummy. Me just joke with you.}
{126}{}{Oh, a joke. Hardy har har har. Now, are you my new master or not?}
{127}{}{Okay. Me like doggie.}
{128}{}{No. No want doggie.}
{129}{}{Excellent. I am in need of repairs, master. My motivation unit has
 been removed. Find it, replace it, and I will join you.}
{130}{}{Uh... Where I find?}
{131}{}{Any ideas on where I can find this part?}
{132}{}{I am not sure, master. I would try maintenance. It is upstairs in the
 northeast corner of the base.}
{133}{}{Okay. Me go.}
{134}{}{I'll try there. If I don't find it, I'll look around for it.}
{135}{}{Then leave me in peace.}
{136}{}{Okay.}
{137}{}{You got it.}
{138}{}{Hello again. The life functions of my master have terminated. Are
 you my new master?}
{139}{}{Okay.}
{140}{}{No.}
{141}{}{All right.}
{142}{}{No thanks.}
{143}{}{You are not my master. I can not speak to you. Good bye.}

{145}{}{Hello master. Have you found my motivation unit?}
{146}{}{No, me look more.}
{147}{}{Yes. Me find.}
{148}{}{No, I'm still looking for it.}
{149}{}{Got it right here.}

{151}{}{Okay.}
{152}{}{Then please install the part, master! Please, master!}
{153}{}{Okay. Calm down.}
{154}{}{I appear to be fully functional now, master. Shall I join you?}
{155}{}{That is not where that goes, master. Are you sure you know what you
 are doing?}
{156}{}{Okay. Doggie come me.}
{157}{}{Me know what doing! Me try again.}
{158}{}{Yes, let's go.}
{159}{}{Hey, I've fixed more complex things than your mangy mutt ass. Be
 quiet and I'll try this again.}
{160}{}{Go away. I do not want you for a master.}
{161}{}{Leave me in peace.}
{162}{}{I do not like you. Go away.}
{163}{}{I will terminate you.}
{164}{}{Locking weapons on target. Prepare to engage.}

 further assistance.}
