{100}{}{You see a man wearing MKII power armor. He doesn't look friendly.}
{101}{}{You see Kaga in MKII power armor.}
{102}{}{A big hunk of metal with arms and guns.}
{103}{}{I tire of the chase. Let's finish this.}
{104}{}{This is the last time you will meet Kaga.}
{105}{}{You are no match for Kaga.}
{106}{}{I look forward to sending you on your next life.}
{107}{}{You have been a worthy enemy.}
{108}{}{This part of the wastes doesn't need a do-gooder like you.}
{109}{}{After I kill you, I will be the most feared person in this part of the wastes.}
{110}{}{I am looking forward to going home to Arroyo - to burn it down.}
{111}{}{Kaga will be famous for killing you.}
{120}{}{Kagaaaaaaaa!}
{150}{}{[A tall and powerfully built warrior stands before you, his eyes blaze with hatred as he looks you over.] So, they cast out Kaga, then deem YOU the Chosen One? Ha! You think being the grandchild of the Vault Dweller makes you special?! You think you are better than I, Kaga the Great?!}
{151}{}{Well, I AM the Chosen One, aren't I?}
{152}{}{Hey now, hold on a second. I never said I was better than you.}
{160}{}{That title will mean nothing when Kaga rips the head from your shoulders!}
{161}{}{No words can save your hide. With your death, Kaga's honor shall be restored. Kaga will now take his vengeance!}
{200}{}{Ooglie?}
{201}{}{What!? They picked *you* to be the Chosen One? Oh my, they've become desperate.}
{202}{}{Me no likie. U lookie bad.}
{203}{}{Kaga won't even bother speaking with you further. Prepare to die at the hands of Kaga!}
