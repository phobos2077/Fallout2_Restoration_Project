{100}{}{You see a man wearing combat armor.}
{101}{}{You see Kaga in combat armor.}
{102}{}{He is wearing combat armor and seems to have some decent weapons.}
{103}{}{This time I'm prepared for you.}
{104}{}{The Chosen One will never return to Arroyo!}
{105}{}{Kaga will crush you!}
{106}{}{Kaga fears no one!}
{107}{}{Hold still, so Kaga can get a good shot.}
{108}{}{We will meet again!}
{109}{}{This is not the last you will see of Kaga.}
{110}{}{Kaga definitely needs more training.}
{120}{}{Go away Kaga!}
{150}{}{[A tall and powerfully built warrior stands before you, his eyes blaze with hatred as he looks you over.] So, they cast out Kaga, then deem YOU the Chosen One? Ha! You think being the grandchild of the Vault Dweller makes you special?! You think you are better than I, Kaga the Great?!}
{151}{}{Well, I AM the Chosen One, aren't I?}
{152}{}{Hey now, hold on a second. I never said I was better than you.}
{160}{}{That title will mean nothing when Kaga rips the head from your shoulders!}
{161}{}{No words can save your hide. With your death, Kaga's honor shall be restored. Kaga will now take his vengeance!}
{200}{}{Ooglie?}
{201}{}{What!? They picked *you* to be the Chosen One? Oh my, they've become desperate.}
{202}{}{Me no likie. U lookie bad.}
{203}{}{Kaga won't even bother speaking with you further. Prepare to die at the hands of Kaga!}
