{500}{}{Looks like I killed them all.}

{601}{}{You see a coin bag. Someone probably tossed it into the well to make a wish.}

{1001}{}{Death to the Slags!}
{1002}{}{I wanna watch 'em scream!}
{1003}{}{Let's go get 'em!}
{1100}{}{You fall some 15 feet into a dimly lit cave. Various farming equipment lays neatly
 stored against the far wall.}

 sending you flying through the air.}
