{100}{}{You see a small, young man dressed in rags.}
{101}{}{You see the village shaman.}
{102}{}{This young man is staring off into the distance. He has a haunted look on his face.}
{103}{}{The shaman appears to be much more at ease.}
{200}{}{[He appears deep in thought. Upon noticing you, he does a startled jump, then quickly regains his composure.] Uh, yes, outworlder? If you come seeking spiritual guidance, I'm afraid I'm not up to it at the moment. Perhaps... perhaps some other time.}
{201}{}{Huh?! Oh, it's you again. You shouldn't sneak up on people like that. Look, I've got a lot on my mind at the moment. Perhaps I could help you some other time.}
{202}{}{It seems like something is troubling you. Is there anything I could help you with?}
{203}{}{I'll come back later.}
{204}{}{Huh-huh! I skeered yu! Booh!}
{210}{}{The offer is appreciated, but... No, no, this is a personal matter that I must face on my own.}
{211}{}{[He contemplates for a moment, then sighs.] This is rather embarrassing to admit but... You see, I've never actually *believed* in spirits, the afterlife, any of it. I know what you're thinking, what good is a shaman that doesn't believe? It's just that, well, it was either this or I take up a spear and hunt geckos with the warriors. Do I look like a warrior to you? Wait, don't answer that.}
{212}{}{So you're a coward and a deceiver. You disgust me.}
{213}{}{If you don't believe, then how do you tend to the spiritual needs of the village?}
{220}{}{Oh, I don't blame you. In fact, I disgust myself quite thoroughly. I don't know why I thought you might help me. I certainly don't deserve to be helped. I got myself into this situation, so it's up to me to get myself out of it. Now if you'll excuse me...}
{221}{}{Hold on there, Captain Pity. Why don't you tell me how exactly you thought I could help you?}
{222}{}{No. I'm not going to excuse you--I'm going to eliminate you and purge the world of your pathetic existence!}
{230}{}{Well, up until just recently I was merely the underling of the village shaman. That was easy, I just had to follow his lead. Then he went for a drunken midnight swim in the Great Salt Water and, well, I suddenly found myself promoted. I didn't think it would be so bad. I figured I could just spout off some mystical mumbo-jumbo and everyone would be happy. But no. The very day that I acquire the title of shaman I find myself dealing with something that's way over my head.}
{231}{}{What happened?}
{240}{}{There's an *actual* lost spirit roaming the woods just south of the village! It's true, I've seen her with my own eyes--a pretty girl with the blank look of the dead. The sight chilled me to the very core. The moment I saw her I pissed myself and ran as fast as I could. The others expect me to go back and guide her into the mists, but how can I? I'm too petrified to go near her again.}
{241}{}{So what could I do to help?}
{242}{}{Unless you got an extra pair of balls laying around that I could pin onto you, I don't know what I could do to help.}
{250}{}{You could go to her. Try to figure out why she lingers in the mortal realm. She appears in the woods to the south at night. If you could find out anything that could help me, I'd greatly appreciate it.}
{251}{}{Not my problem. It's time for you to man-up and do your job.}
{252}{}{I'll look into it.}
{260}{}{Did you change your mind? Will you help me with the lost spirit?}
{261}{}{Like I said before, it's not my problem. Bye.}
{262}{}{Eh, I suppose I could look into it. I'll let you know what I find out.}
{270}{}{You're back. Did you discover anything about the lost spirit?}
{271}{}{I'm working on it. I'll get back to you.}
{272}{}{I spoke to--er, listened to--the spirit. It seems she was betrayed and murdered by her lover, someone named Thorg.}
{280}{}{Thorg?! He was the shaman that I served as an apperceive under. Wow, I knew he was a bit of an asshole, but I didn't take him for a slayer of pretty young girls. Hmm, I suppose a guilty conscience helps to explain that drunken midnight swim that lead to his death. So Thorg is a murderer... how 'bout that...}
{281}{}{So what now?}
{290}{}{[Heavy sigh.] Now I suppose I have to send her into the mists. I think I'll be able to do it, but I need you to come with me. There's just no way I'd be able to face her alone and none of the others in the village will go--they believe it's an ill omen for a non-shaman to encounter a lost spirit.}
{291}{}{Nah. I've already done too much for you. You're on your own.}
{292}{}{Don't worry, I'll help you get through this.}
{293}{}{Okay, I'll do it. But only because it'll be fun to watch you squirm.}
{300}{}{Please tell me you've reconsidered. You'll come with me to take care of the lost spirit, right?}
{301}{}{Wrong. You're on your own. Bye.}
{302}{}{Okay, I'll do it. But only because it'll be fun to watch you squirm.}
{310}{}{Oh, shit... oh, shit... No, I can do this... Okay. Nessa?}
{311}{}{Ohhh... So cold and alone...}
{312}{}{Nessa, you must hear my voice. I am calling to you from the mortal world.}
{313}{}{I... I hear someone! Who is there? }
{314}{}{I am the shaman of this village. You must enter the mists. There, you will find peace.}
{315}{}{Yes! Yes I see the mists now. I see spirits beckoning to me.}
{316}{}{Go to them, Nessa. Go into the mists and join your ancestors.}
{317}{}{I'm not alone anymore.}
{320}{}{Thank you for helping us rescue Serin. I gave him some herbs to help him rest and ease his pain. Spirits willing, he should be back up and about after a couple days.}
{330}{}{Let's see here... Oh, excellent. These will work well. Here, take some healing powder for your time. May your ancestors guide you well.}
{400}{}{Yes, yes, very funny. Now run along. I'm busy.}
{401}{}{::Turn to leave, then quickly whirl back around:: Booh!}
{410}{}{Ah! Dammit! Get out of here! Go!}
{411}{}{Huh-huh! Bu-bye!}
{420}{}{I told you before, Simple One, go on and leave me be.}
{500}{}{You've given me the courage I need to serve this village. I can't thank you enough.}
{501}{}{I will forever be in your debt.}
{600}{}{Thank you for helping us rescue Serin. I gave him some herbs to help him rest and ease his pain. He should be back up and about after a couple days.}
{601}{}{That's good to hear. Anything else I can do?}
{602}{}{I'm glad Serin will make it. Take care.}
{610}{}{Actually, yes, I suppose there is something. Healing Serin has exhausted most of my herb supply. If you could fetch me five Xander Roots and three Broc Flowers, I'd be most grateful.}
{611}{}{Five Xander Roots and three Broc Flowers, got it. I'll return once I've found them for you.}
{612}{}{Looks like today's your lucky day. I already have what you're looking for right here. Take em, they're yours.}
{613}{}{Sorry, but I'm far too busy to go gallivanting through the woods, gathering herbs for you.}
{614}{}{Why such an exact amount?}
{620}{}{Because, I'm very... particular about things. It's all about balance, certain numbers... [He frowns.] Look, I
 don't expect you to understand, but that's just the way I am. I need five Xander Roots and three Broc Flowers, no more,
 no less. Will you help me?}
{630}{}{Have you obtained the items I need?}
{631}{}{Yup, I have everything right here.}
{632}{}{I'm still looking. Bye.}
{640}{}{Lets see here... Oh, excellent. These will work well. Here, take some healing powder for your time.}
{641}{}{Thank you. Bye.}
{1000}{}{You relieve the Tribe's Shaman of his troubles.}
{2000}{}{You deliver the herbs to the Shaman.}
{3000}{}{I knew you were a great hero all along... The spirits told me so.}
{3001}{}{I'm glad my healing powders protected you from the Enclave.}
