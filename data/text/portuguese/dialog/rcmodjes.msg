{100}{}{You see Madame Modjeska.}
{101}{}{You see Madame Modjeska.}
{102}{}{I want to be alone.}
{103}{}{Please just go away.}
{104}{}{Não me incomode.}
{105}{}{Please leave me.}
{106}{}{I have no tolerance for the simple.}
{107}{}{Most of the rabble are just working to get enough Jet. They need something to take their minds
 off this place.}
{108}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{109}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{110}{}{Entendo, adeus.}
{111}{}{Jet does have its uses. It tends to make one care somewhat less about the surrounding squalor.}
{112}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{113}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{114}{}{Entendo, adeus.}
{115}{}{Jet is so expensive lately. It's just criminal. Speaking of which... I hear that our cherished
 Mayor Ascorti is working to get us more Jet. Always a champion of the masses, that man is.}
{116}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{117}{}{Mayor Asctorti? Who is that exactly?}
{118}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{119}{}{Entendo, adeus.}
{120}{}{Seems like everyone's sick. That last batch of Jet had everyone swearing off the stuff. My
 guess is that they'll be back on Jet soon enough, though.}
{121}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{122}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{123}{}{Entendo, adeus.}
{124}{}{Looks like I was wrong. Most of the people who were real Jet pilots have sworn off the stuff.
 After that last bad batch, most of us can't so much as smell the stuff without getting sick to our
 stomachs.}
{125}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{126}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{127}{}{Entendo, adeus.}
{128}{}{I am... Madame Modjeska. What do you wish of me?}
{129}{}{Com o que posso ajudar?}
{130}{}{I don't have time to waste. What do you want of Madame Modjeska?}
{131}{}{I can hardly be bothered with this now. What do you want?}
{132}{}{Madame Modjeska feels indisposed today. What do you want of her?}
{133}{}{My head feels as though it must surely split in twain. What do you want of me?}
{134}{}{I'm Madame Modjeska. One time Jet user, amongst other things. Now I only dabble in other things.
 I find that Jet no longer agrees with me.}
{135}{}{What can the Madame do for you?}
{136}{}{What do you do here Madame Modjeska?}
{137}{}{Looks as though a lot of people here are drug-users. What's going on in town lately?}
{138}{}{Hear any interesting rumors?}
{139}{}{Why do they call you Madame Modjeska?}
{140}{}{Qual é o problema com você?}
{141}{}{What happened to you?}
{142}{}{Lately, I don't do much at all. I used to run part of Lou's operation at the Malamute Saloon -
 but we had a falling out, so I quit.}
{143}{}{Deixa eu te perguntar outra coisa, então.}
{144}{}{I understand. Well, that's all I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{145}{}{All I hear about are politics. That always seems to be the big stir in discussion.}
{146}{}{Politics? What do you mean?}
{147}{}{Of course. Let me ask you about something else.}
{148}{}{Well, that's all I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{149}{}{I used to work in the Malamute Saloon. As part of that job, people called me Madame. The name
 just stuck, even though I don't work there any more.}
{150}{}{Where do you work now?}
{151}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{152}{}{Acho que é tudo que preciso saber. Adeus.}
{153}{}{I flew a bit of Jet a few days back and it made me feel quite unwell. Must have been a tainted
 batch. I 'm not eager to try that again. Oh well, back to the bottle, I suppose.}
{154}{}{Sounds bad. Let me ask you something else, then.}
{155}{}{I understand. Well, that's all I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{156}{}{I feel better than I look. Not by much, but enough.}
{157}{}{What do you mean? What happened?}
{158}{}{Have you ever seen a greased brahmin contest?}
{159}{}{Sure I have. Uh, plenty of times. Let me ask you something else.}
{160}{}{Nope, never heard of anything like that. Tell me about them.}
{161}{}{I don't know what that has to do with local politics, and I don't think I want to know. Goodbye.}
{162}{}{After that last tainted batch of Jet, I've sworn off the stuff. Maybe when I feel better I'll
 get drunk instead. (she laughs)}
{163}{}{Well, good for you, I guess. Let me ask you something.}
{164}{}{Interesting. Well, I'll leave you to your recovery. Goodbye.}
{165}{}{What they do is grease up a brahmin calf, and then everyone in the crowd tries to catch the
 calf. If you can't catch it yourself, you make damn sure nobody else can, either.}
{166}{}{I don't see what that has to do with politics.}
{167}{}{Yeah, sure. I've heard enough, Madame Modjeska. Goodbye.}
{168}{}{In this game, Redding is the greased brahmin - and a golden one at that. New Reno, the New
 California Republic, and Vault City are all trying to catch us... or at least keep the others from
 catching us.}
{169}{}{O que você quer dizer?}
{170}{}{That's nice. Well, I better be going, Madame. Thanks for the insight. Goodbye.}
{171}{}{Here in Redding we mine gold. Then we ship it to New Reno, the NCR, and Vault City in return for
 goods. Each of those places would like to have the gold - and the trade - all to themselves.}
{172}{}{Why don't they just attack you and take it, then?}
{173}{}{Who wouldn't? I think I'll try to find some of that gold myself. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{174}{}{We're big enough, and far enough away, to make a take-over expensive as well as dangerous. Much
 more efficient to have us join willingly.}
{175}{}{O que você quer dizer?}
{176}{}{That makes sense. Thanks for clueing me in. Goodbye.}
{177}{}{The three powers are trying to get Redding to choose which side to ally themselves with. They've
 all got powerful allies in town, and it looks like things are coming to a head. Soon, Redding's going to
 have to make a choice.}
{178}{}{A choice?}
{179}{}{Who's working for whom?}
{180}{}{Money. Hmm. Well I've got to be going. Goodbye.}
{181}{}{The grease on this Brahmin calf is getting a bit thin. Soon, one of the powers is going to have
 to make a major play to take Redding before the others do. When that happens, people are going to get
 hurt. A lot of people.}
{182}{}{Who's working for whom?}
{183}{}{Why are people going to get hurt?}
{184}{}{Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
{185}{}{I'm not altogether sure, but I think the lineup's like this: Dan McGrew's all for New Reno,
 Marge LeBarge's for the NCR, Doc Johnson's for Vault City, and I don't know yet who Mayor Ascorti's for.}
{186}{}{How can those people help a takeover?}
{187}{}{Who's Marge LeBarge?}
{188}{}{Who's Dan McGrew?}
{189}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{190}{}{Who's Mayor Ascorti?}
{191}{}{Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
{192}{}{People are going to get hurt because this kind of change doesn't come easy. Those that think
 they're not going to get the prize get it in their mind to not let anyone else get it, either. The
 only way to avoid that is if we decide to go with one of the powers and make a quick alliance before
 the others catch on.}
{193}{}{O que você acha que acontecerá?}
{194}{}{Entendo. Obrigado, tchau.}
{195}{}{I think that the folks here will follow Mayor Ascorti's lead. He's a crook, but people trust
 that. He'll go with whoever's strongest. You see, whatever's good for Ascorti is also going to be good
 for Redding. I think he just hasn't figured out who's closest to being on top yet. But he's got to
 choose soon.}
{196}{}{Deixa eu te perguntar outra coisa.}
{197}{}{Thanks for letting me know what's going on here. Goodbye.}
{198}{}{Marge LeBarge is the owner of the Kokoweef Mine. It and the Morningstar Mine are the only two
 working mines left in Redding. I think that Marge's more of an NCR type. I don't think she likes their
 prudishness, but she recognizes power when she sees it.}
{199}{}{Who's Dan McGrew?}
{200}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{201}{}{Who's Mayor Ascorti?}
{202}{}{How can these people help a takeover?}
{203}{}{Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
{204}{}{Dangerous Dan McGrew, ah, yes. He's the owner of the Morningstar Mine. It and the Kokoweef Mine
 are the only two working mines left in Redding. I think Dan is leaning more towards New Reno, if I had
 to guess. He likes his miners doped up and happy.}
{205}{}{Who's Marge LeBarge?}
{206}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{207}{}{Who's Mayor Ascorti?}
{208}{}{How can these people help a takeover?}
{209}{}{Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
{210}{}{Ascorti's the Mayor. He runs Ascorti's Ace downtown. He takes care of buying and selling a lot
 of stuff. He's right in the middle of all kinds o' thangs.}
{211}{}{Ascorti é o prefeito de Redding. Mas não sei direito onde ele está, faz um bom tempo que não
 o vejo por aí.}
{212}{}{Deixa eu te perguntar outra coisa.}
{213}{}{Acho que já ouvi você o suficiente. Adeus.}
{214}{}{Jet is a wonderful drug that helps me to take the edge of this miserable existence, darling.}
{215}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{216}{}{Interessante. Obrigado e adeus.}
{217}{}{Jet's a drug that helps me to feel truly alive. I'm a real sky-pilot with Jet.}
{218}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{219}{}{Interesting. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{220}{}{Mmmm, I'll tell you what Jet is. It's delicious, that's what it is. Jet has something for
 everybody.}
{221}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{222}{}{Interesting. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{223}{}{Jet used to be the thing. Now it's turning my guts around and around like a worn-out washing
 machine. I wouldn't recommend any of the current batch. This Jet has run out of fuel and crashed,
 darling.}
{224}{}{Sure, sorry. Let me ask you something else.}
{225}{}{Interesting. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{226}{}{Something was desperately wrong with the last batch of Jet that went through town. It crashed
 and burned on take-off. I think I'm through flying. Now, drinking - there's something that you can
 depend on.}
{227}{}{Deixe-me perguntar-lhe algo mais.}
{228}{}{Interesting. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{229}{}{Painless Doc Johnson's sort of a mystery man. I don't know where he came from, but he's a real
 M.D., all right. Only place he'd get training like that is Vault City. I'm betting he's been planted
 here to further their interests. He must've pissed off someone there to get the assignment, though;
 those VC'ers don't like the outside much.}
{230}{}{Who's Marge LeBarge?}
{231}{}{Who's Dan McGrew?}
{232}{}{Who's Mayor Ascorti?}
{233}{}{How can these people help a takeover?}
{234}{}{Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
{235}{}{The Mayor's a man that knows how to play both sides while he's stealing the middle. He's got a
 few scruples left, but mostly he'll do what's right for Redding in order to keep his own interests safe.}
{236}{}{Who's Marge LeBarge?}
{237}{}{Who's Dan McGrew?}
{238}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{239}{}{How can these people help a takeover?}
{240}{}{Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
