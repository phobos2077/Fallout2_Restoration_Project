{100}{}{Você vê um escravista carrancudo coberto de sujeira.}
{101}{}{Você vê um escravista de aparência dura. Ele parece estar no comando aqui.}
{102}{}{Você vê Don, o escravista responsável por este acampamento.}
{105}{}{Ei, que porra é essa!? Quem é você?}
{106}{}{Eu sou o seu pior pesadelo. Prepare-se para a morte!}
{107}{}{Metzger me enviou.}
{108}{}{Estou aqui para me unir.}
{109}{}{Uhh, não foi aqui que deixei meu carro...}
{200}{}{Você primeiro, babaca.}
{201}{}{I don't have time for this, get 'em boys.}
{202}{}{Join us? This aint a fuckin recruiting center. If you want to join the slavers go to the Den and speak with Metzger.
 Now do you need something or are you just here to piss me off?}
{203}{}{Metzger sent you? [He fidgets uncomfortably.] Don't tell me he wants more slaves already -- for fuck's sake, we just sent a shipment last week.}
{300}{}{Actually yes, I do need something.}
{301}{}{Então, por que você está aqui?}
{302}{}{I don't think I need anything else.}
{303}{}{Well then get the fuck outta here. You're trespassing and you ain't wanted.}
{304}{}{Estou de saída.}
{305}{}{Oh, I'll leave--but not until I've killed you and your buddies.}
{307}{}{As a matter of fact, he does. He's going to be entertaining some big shot from New Reno, and wanted a couple more girls for the occasion. But, hey if you can't spare any... I'm sure the boss will be thrilled when I return empty handed.}
{308}{}{[Sweat begins to form on the man's tattooed head.] Whoa, hold on a second. I never said I couldn't spare a few. In fact, here, take the key to the shack, that's where we keep our, uh, personal favorites. The pick of the litter, you might say. [He hands you a key and smiles nervously.]}
{309}{}{Thanks. I'll put in a good word for you. Bye.}
{310}{}{Metzger sent you, huh? Do I look blind to you? You're not even wearing our fuckin mark. I don't know who you are, but you're full of shit and you're wasting my time. For that, you die. [Signals to his men.] Let's waste this loser.}
{311}{}{Yeah right. You're full of shit and you're wasting my time. For that, you die. [Signals to his men.] Let's waste this loser.}
{400}{}{I'm busy. Go see Metzger in the Den if you want to do a run.}
{450}{}{Didn't I tell you to scram? We don't take too kindly to trespassers. Time to die.}
{500}{}{[FEITO]}
{600}{}{Agora é a hora que você vai morrer!}
{601}{}{Die Ranger scum!}
{800}{}{Umm... Give Metzger my regards.}
{900}{}{No, actually, he sent me to have a look at your stock. You see, I have very particular tastes, but I'm willing to
 pay a premium price.}
{901}{}{Bullshit. Metzger's never sent a customer out here before. I don't know what you're trying to pull, but you've
 got three seconds to get the fuck outta my face before I have my boys pump you full of lead.}
