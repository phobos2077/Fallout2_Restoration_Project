{370}{}{Thanks, I'm flattered. Just stopped by to say hello.}
{375}{}{Nope, it's just stubborn... just like him. It could probably use a little repair work, but we ain't got no slot
 mechanics that can fix that damn thing.}
{376}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{377}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information.}
{385}{}{Yeah, that son of a bitch came in here about a week ago, ripped off one table of about a thousand chips, then bailed.
 Don't know where he is now, but he used to have a room at the Desperado.}
{386}{}{Yeah, some guy by that name was rentin' one of th' rooms upstairs...204. He was all paid up, but he bailed
 a few days ago and nobody saw him leave.}
{387}{}{Mr. Salvatore mentioned that there was a specific dealer that Lloyd won the money from. Who was that?}
{388}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{389}{}{Obrigado pela informação.}
{395}{}{Nikki? Yeah, she's over there, at the middle table. Is there some sort of problem?}
{396}{}{Sem problemas. Só queria conhecê-la. Só tenho algumas perguntas...}
{397}{}{Obrigado pela informação.}
{405}{}{Her name WAS Nikki. She used to work here but she got aced... not too long ago.}
{406}{}{Hmmm. Você se importa se eu te fizer outras perguntas...?}
{407}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information.}
{415}{}{Her name was Nikki. She used to work here but she took off not too long ago. Just packed her shit and bailed.}
{416}{}{Você se importa se eu te fizer outras perguntas...}
{417}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information.}
{425}{}{Sure, be good for business. Dressing room's in the back...}
{426}{}{Excellent. I'll be on stage in a few minutes...}
{427}{}{Não agora. Eu tenho outras perguntas...}
{428}{}{Not right now, but I'll be back.}
{435}{}{No, we're still recovering from your last gig. You might want to check some of the other casinos.}
{436}{}{Que bom, obrigado. Olha, eu tenho outras perguntas...}
{437}{}{Certo... Mas eu voltarei.}
{445}{}{[You count up the evening's chips. Not a bad haul.]}
{446}{}{The leather was a nice touch. }
{447}{}{That ball gag you had with you didn't hurt, either. }
{448}{}{[CONTINUAR]}
{455}{}{Yeah, he stinks worse than brahmin shit. Still, you...? Aw, why the hell not. A little improv ain't gonna hurt, but
 it's a rough crowd... better hope you're good.}
{456}{}{Oh, I'm good... just watch me go.}
{457}{}{Not right now, but I'll be back.}
{500}{}{That was some funny shit. You're the next Milton Berle. Come back in a week for another show.}
{501}{}{That was a great show. You got a great routine. Come back in a week for another show.}
{502}{}{I will. See you around.}
{510}{}{That was just awful. I don't know how you do it, but you are actually worse than the regular. I don't think we will be needing you again.}
{511}{}{Fine, I'll go take my talent to someone who WILL actually appreciate it.}
{512}{}{Seja o que for. Tchau.}
{520}{}{You were smokin' out there. The next Traci Lords. }
{521}{}{I don't think I have seen anyone move like that on stage. You got real talent. }
{522}{}{I will. See you around.}
{523}{}{Come back in a week for another show.}
{530}{}{Sorry, you're not up to our standards.}
{531}{}{Whatever. I got some other questions.}
{532}{}{Fine, I'll go find someone who WILL appreciate my talent. Bye.}
{620}{}{Interested in me doing another comic routine?}

{1001}{}{My doctor recently told me that jogging could add years to my life. I think he was right. I feel ten years older already.}
{1002}{}{Folks who don't know why America is the Land of Promise should be here during an election campaign.}
{1003}{}{Politicians have always made me laugh.}
{1004}{}{Someone once told me I don't exercise enough. Well, they're wrong. I get my exercise running to the funerals of my friends who exercise.}

{1347}{}{Quem é você?}
{1348}{}{Who owns this casino?}
{1349}{}{Okay, thanks. Sorry to bother you.}
{1355}{}{ Family. They pumped a lot of life into this place, made it a real night spot, a shining jewel in New Reno.}
{1356}{}{ Family. That a problem? Cause if you ain't here to gamble, then this ain't the place for you. Understand?}
{1361}{}{. Love your films.}
{1365}{}{That guy? Old Man McGee? Crazy sumabitch... he's been playing that machine
 there for the past few years, waiting for the big jackpot. His life fortune
 must be sitting in that thing, but it won't give him a single chip.}
{1366}{}{That guy? Old Man McGee? Crazy sumabitch, that's for sure. Heh.
 Sure was pissed about you winning his fortune. I'd be careful around him.}
{1367}{}{Is the machine rigged?}

{1425}{}{Sure. Let's hope you are as good as last time.}

{1503}{}{Ok, why were the suspenders arrested?}
{1504}{}{Ok, why couldn't the woman buy a bakery shop?}
{2000}{}{Your comic routine was a success.}
{2001}{}{Your comic routine was a flop.}
{2003}{}{In Washington, a man gets up to speak and doesn't say a thing, and the other men disagree with him for three hours.}
{2010}{}{Your erotic dance routine was a success.}
{2335}{}{. Need anything, just ask.}
{2336}{}{. At least, last time I checked the sign outside the door. Now what can I do for you?}
{2500}{}{[2 hours pass.]}
{2501}{}{[1 hour passes.]}
{2502}{}{Lunch is on me.}
