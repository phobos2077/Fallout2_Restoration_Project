{100}{}{You see an elderly man with deep wrinkles along his face. If he notices you looking at him, he gives no sign.}
{101}{}{You see Cassidy.}
{102}{}{You see an elderly man with deep wrinkles along his face. He nods at you.}
{103}{Cas0103}{Well, now. I ain't seen you around before, stranger. Name's Cassidy. I run this place. What can I do for you?}
{104}{Cas0104}{Bem, se não é o meu herói. O que a mãe pode fazer por você hoje?}
{105}{}{Ug Nog?}
{106}{}{Desliga}
{107}{}{Estou a procura da Vault.}
{108}{}{You looking to get out of here yet?}
{109}{}{What have you got on tap?}
{110}{}{Anything interesting going on around here?}
{111}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{112}{Cas0112}{Hit on the head a little too often, eh? Sorry, I don't speak imbecile.}
{113}{}{Bee-sil?}
{114}{Cas0114}{Vault? Only Vault I know of is the one inside the city. Big friggin' hole... you can't miss it, trust me.}
{115}{}{What do you have to drink here?}
{116}{}{Anything interesting going on around here?}
{117}{}{Obrigado pelas direções. Tchau.}
{118}{Cas0118}{Beer for $20, shot of whiskey for $30. Nothing special. Why, you want something?}
{119}{}{Estou a procura da Vault.}
{120}{}{I'll take a beer.}
{121}{}{I'll take a shot.}
{122}{}{Anything interesting going on around here?}
{123}{}{Not really. Thanks anyway.}
{124}{Cas0124}{"Interesting?" Heh. Friend, Vault City ain't an "interesting" place... unless the guards get bored, then you
 better take cover. Why you asking? You looking for something in this sinkhole?}
{125}{}{What do you have to drink here?}
{126}{}{Actually, I'm looking for the Vault.}
{127}{}{It can't be that bad here.}
{128}{}{Not really. Thanks anyway.}
{129}{Cas0129}{Here you go. Drink up. It might help you forget where you are.}
{130}{}{This place can't be that bad.}
{131}{}{Thanks for the drink. I have to be going.}
{132}{Cas0132}{Oh, really? Well, hell then, I must be mistaken, considering YOU'RE the authority and all. Guess you must have been napping during the raid last week?}
{133}{}{Raid?}
{134}{Cas0134}{Aw, yeah, a beautiful sight it was. A guard patrol broke in here looking for "illegal substances." They busted down the door, busted up my stock, then busted up a few of my customers, too.}
{135}{}{What happened after that?}
{136}{}{Sorry to hear it. I'll talk to you later.}
{137}{Cas0137}{After they hauled away this one guy, Joshua, for resisting arrest, they fined my ass for finding - get this - REAL whiskey on the premises. Nevermind that I got a permit from Stark three months before. Bastards.}
{138}{}{Whoa. No kidding.}
{139}{}{Sorry to hear it. I'll talk to you later.}
{140}{Cas0140}{It gets better. Now I'm in debt to the guards for the fine, an' I had to buy a new case of alcohol from a merchant at triple my standard rate. I'm expecting the guards to come knocking again soon, just to bust my chops. }
{141}{}{What's it like most of the time?}
{142}{}{Hope things look up for you in the future. See you.}
{143}{Cas0143}{Even the good days ain't worth a damn. The Citizens don't drink much, so I'm stuck here pouring drinks for merchants. The next cheap sonuvabitch who haggles for a drink is going to be wearing his ass as a hat.}
{144}{}{Why are you here if you hate it so much?}
{145}{}{Sorry to hear that. I'm looking for a Vault. Can you help me out?}
{146}{}{Sorry to hear it. Hope things get better.}
{147}{Cas0147}{I have a bad heart. Need cardio booster shots to keep it beating. This city's the only place to get real medical care, so I thought I'd settle here, try and make a living.}
{148}{}{You sound pretty fed up with the place.}
{149}{}{I see. Say, I'm looking for a Vault. Can you help me out?}
{150}{}{Hope things get better for you from here on. See you.}
{151}{Cas0151}{Makes me want to close up shop and let this City rot. Screw 'em all.}
{152}{}{Why don't you leave?}
{153}{}{Sorry to hear it. Hope things work out for you.}
{154}{Cas0154}{Go into the wastes by myself? Ha! I'm sick of this place, but I ain't stupid.}
{155}{}{I'm heading out that way again. Why don't you come along?}
{156}{}{Well, good luck to you then.}
{157}{Cas0157}{No offense or nothin', but you don't look too capable of leading anybody. It looks like the wastes would have you for dinner.}
{158}{Cas0158}{Naw, I don't travel with slavers. They have a nasty habit o' selling you when they get low on cash. No offense.}
{159}{Cas0159}{Naw, you have the look of somebody with one foot in the grave and the other in hell. I don't think I need to stain my reputation any more than it is.}
{160}{Cas0160}{Naw... you look like you got enough of a crowd already.}
{161}{}{All right. Well, good luck.}
{162}{}{Forget I asked then, asshole. Go back to tending bar in this shitwater burg.}
{163}{}{Nevermind then. Your loss.}
{164}{Cas0164}{Ei, tá falando sério?}
{165}{}{Sure. Why the hell not? You look like you know how to take care of yourself in a fight.}
{166}{}{On second thought, it's pretty dangerous out there, especially for someone with heart trouble. You'd be better off here.}
{167}{Cas0167}{Tudo bem, conte comigo.}
{168}{}{Let's hit it.}
{169}{}{}
{170}{}{}
{171}{Cas0171}{What's up? You got that "I need to tell you something you might not like" look again.}
{172}{Cas0172}{Sim?}
{173}{Cas0173}{What's up? You got that "I'm pulling rank" look again.}
{174}{}{Eu gostaria de lhe fazer algumas perguntas...}
{175}{}{You look like you've taken some damage. Use some stims and heal yourself.}
{176}{}{Cassidy, I need you to wait here until I come back.}
{177}{}{Coloque sua arma de distância.}
{178}{}{Ficar perto de mim.}
{179}{}{Não fique muito longe.}
{180}{}{Devemos espalhar um pouco.}
{181}{}{C'mon, Cassidy. Time to head out.}
{182}{}{Nada, esquece.}
{261}{Cas0261}{You want me to put a bullet in Myron's head, is that it? It'd be no trouble. Just give the word.}
{262}{Cas0262}{O que tem em mente?}
{263}{}{Why do you want to cap Myron?}
{264}{}{What weapons are you skilled with?}
{265}{}{Actually, I had something else I wanted you to do...}
{266}{}{Actually, I had something I wanted you to do...}
{267}{}{Nevermind. Let's move on.}
{268}{}{No, don't hurt Myron. Not today, anyway. I'll keep you posted.}
{269}{Cas0269}{Well, shotguns and rifles, mostly... just personal preference. I ain't a bad shot with pistols, neither.}
{270}{}{Mais alguma coisa?}
{271}{}{OK. Eu tinha algumas outras perguntas...}
{272}{}{All right. Just checking.}
{273}{Cas0273}{If you ever need to learn somebody some manners up close and personal, slip me some brass knuckles, and I can tapdance on their face with my fists.}
{274}{}{Great. Anything else?}
{275}{}{OK. Eu tinha algumas outras perguntas...}
{276}{}{All right. Just checking.}
{277}{Cas0277}{Uh, well... just between you and me, I can also use a spear pretty good. Me and my buddies used to hunt radscorpions with spears way back when... fact I'm alive and they ain't might tell you something.}
{278}{}{Nothing wrong with using a spear.}
{279}{}{OK. Eu tinha algumas outras perguntas...}
{280}{}{All right. Just checking.}
{281}{Cas0281}{Says you. Just don't be calling me no tribal, and we'll get along just fine.}
{282}{Cas0282}{Don't want people mistaking me for ol' Bone-nose over there. Heh-heh. I ain't never seen no tribal do something as dumb as jam a bone in his nose.}
{283}{Cas0283}{Of course there isn't. Spear's a fine weapon. Lots of tribal friends of mine use 'em.}
{284}{}{Did you know that I am a "tribal?"}
{285}{}{Hmmm. Look, I had some other questions...}
{286}{}{All right. Thanks for the rundown.}
{287}{Cas0287}{Aw, don't be playing with ol' Cassidy now. You ain't no tribal.}
{288}{}{Sim, eu sou.}
{289}{}{Whatever. Look, I had some other questions...}
{290}{}{Forget it. I don't want to get into this with you right now.}
{291}{Cas0291}{Uh, well... damn it all, you can have my apology right here and now. I didn't mean any offense.}
{292}{}{Sure you didn't. Look, I had some other questions...}
{293}{}{Forget it. Let's move on.}
{294}{Cas0294}{Well, now, before you go, I got a question for you. What are we doing out here? We seem to be running all over the place looking for something. Have we got some sort of plan?}
{295}{}{We're looking for a GECK - a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. My village needs it to restore their crops.}
{296}{}{We're going to the Vault, then return the GECK to my village.}
{297}{}{My village has been kidnapped. I'm trying to find out what happened to them.}
{298}{Cas0298}{Them things come in kits now, huh? Man, the good book don't mention that, does it? Well, all right then. Let's get hunting.}
{299}{Cas0299}{Ok, certo, apenas verificando.}
{300}{Cas0300}{I wouldn't mind plugging a few holes in some kidnappers. A little frontier justice never hurt anyone... well, at least not me.}
{301}{}{All right. Let's go.}
{302}{Cas0302}{The things that little cuss says ain't fit for decent ears.}
{303}{Cas0303}{Especially a woman's.}
{304}{}{Why, Cassidy, I didn't know you cared. My heart's all a-flutter.}
{305}{}{So? What are you saying?}
{306}{}{You know, you cuss a lot, too, Cassidy.}
{307}{}{Tell me about it. Let's get going.}
{308}{Cas0308}{Yeah, but when I do it, it's got style. He's just a little trash mouth.}
{309}{Cas0309}{E eu também não gosto do jeito que ele olha para você.}
{310}{}{Why, Cassidy, I didn't know you cared. My heart's all a-flutter.}
{311}{}{So? What are you saying?}
{312}{}{Tell me about it. Let's get going.}
{313}{Cas0313}{Espere um pouco, eu não quis dizer nada disso.}
{314}{Cas0314}{All I'm saying is that bona fide little asshole's gonna get his number clocked one day when it's just me and him and a hole in the desert.}
{315}{}{Well, life can be a harsh teacher on its own. I had some other questions for you...}
{316}{}{Well, he's bound to bite it any time now anyway. I wouldn't worry about it.}
{317}{}{Just calm down, Cassidy. Leave Myron alone.}
{318}{}{I hate this place.}
{319}{}{I was hoping we'd steer clear of this place for good.}
{320}{}{City of tight-asses...}
{321}{}{This place looks worse than Vault City.}
{322}{}{Good thing I checked my weapons before I came in here.}
{323}{}{If I kick the bucket, don't bury me here.}
{324}{}{Cuidado por aqui. Os locais não são muito amigáveis.}
{325}{}{Hehe. Nunca pensei que veria São Francisco.}
{326}{}{Nunca pensei que você manteria um veterano como eu por tanto tempo. Vamos fazer este trabalho e ir para casa.}
{327}{}{Redding é uma cidade mineira. Ouro, principalmente. Muitas caravanas vieram para Vault City daqui.}
{328}{}{Broken Hills é uma cidade mineira... principalmente minério de urânio. Pode ser um lugar difícil, então tome cuidado.}
{329}{}{Eu tenho algum veneno pelo meu corpo. Tem algum antídoto?}
{330}{}{Estou brilhando como um letreiro de néon aqui. Tem algum remedio anti-radiação?}
{331}{}{Estou sofrendo muito aqui. Tem algum stimpack?}
{332}{}{Fique longe de problemas, Myron. Estou te vigilando.}
{333}{}{Saia da linha, Myron, e eu te quebro.}
{334}{}{Droga, Lenny, você precisa de um banho. Ou algum desinfetante.}
{335}{}{Ghoulzinho do céu, fica mais longe, vai. Porque, meu amigo, você fede.}
{336}{}{Esse é o cachorro mais feio que eu já vi.}
{337}{}{Calma, cachorrinho. Cassidy é sua amigo, certo?}
{338}{}{Me pergunto o que esse cachorro robô come. Humanos, provavelmente.}
{339}{}{Se esse cachorro robô começar a trepar com a minha perna, vou mata-lo.}
{340}{}{Ahhhh. Rapaz, estou feliz que eles fizeram milhões dessas coisas antes da bomba cair.}
{341}{}{Muito obrigado, amigo.}
{342}{}{Espero que tomar esses stimpacks não machuque meu coração...}
{343}{}{O que...?! Não, meu coração! Eu... *hrrrkk*}
{344}{}{Desculpe, só estava admirando a vista.}
{345}{}{Maldição, eu vou ficar aqui, então.}
{346}{}{Perdão, amigo. Não quis bloquear seu caminho.}
{347}{}{Ahhhh. Isso atingiu o alvo. Muito obrigado.}
{348}{}{*Hic* Heh-heh. Nothing like some good ol' firewater to get the blood pumping.}
{349}{}{Thanks. Hell, you should take a swig, too.}
{350}{}{That's the Vault. Big friggin' thing, innit?}
{351}{}{You want me to join you again?}
{352}{}{I'm good to go whenever you are.}
{353}{}{Sure you don't need my help?}
{354}{}{I'm itching to get going.}
{355}{}{Sure could go for a smoke.}
{356}{}{Dad named me after some comic book character from before the war. Said he was a mean sonuvabitch, too.}
{357}{}{It's good to be traveling again. Living in Vault City was giving me an ulcer.}
{358}{}{Hope my heart doesn't act up while we're travelling...}
{359}{}{Sure could use a drink.}
{360}{}{Better check my gear again.}
{361}{}{Goddamn arthritis...}
{362}{}{If I was twenty years younger, I'd go east and explore the Midwest. Too late now, I s'pose.}
{363}{}{I hear they got twisters miles wide in the Midwest. It's a big ol' radioactive dustbowl now.}
{364}{}{Wonder if Texas survived the war...}
{365}{}{Thanks, friend. I... whoa. Now my vision's getting all cloudy.}
{366}{}{I heard this stuff makes you hallucin... whoa! Where the hell did all these snakes come from?!}
{367}{}{Whenever I take this stuff, I have flashbacks.}
{368}{}{Nothing like a little backwater tribal healing...}
{369}{}{I'm about due for some crutches and a wheelchair over here.}
{370}{}{Cassidy dies of a heart attack.}
{371}{}{You have convinced Cassidy to join your party.}
{372}{}{Just let me pop a heart pill first...}
{1000}{Cas1000}{Bem... tudo bem então. Vou esperar aqui até você voltar. }
{1100}{Cas1100}{Sure. Can't promise I won't pull it out again if there's trouble, though.}
{1200}{Cas1200}{All right, I'll stick close to you then. You must be expecting trouble.}
{1300}{Cas1300}{All right, I'll keep some distance. Get a better vantage point that way.}
{1400}{Cas1400}{All right, I'll be watching your back. You need me, holler, and I'll come running.}
{2000}{Cas2000}{No offense or nothin', but you don't look too capable of leading anybody. It looks like the wastes would have you for dinner.}
{2100}{Cas2100}{Naw, I don't travel with slavers. They have a nasty habit o' selling you when they get low on cash. No offense.}
{2200}{Cas2200}{Naw, you have the look of somebody with one foot in the grave and the other in hell. I don't think I need to stain my reputation any more than it is.}
{2300}{Cas2300}{Naw... you look like you got enough of a crowd already.}
{2400}{Cas2400}{Tudo bem, então.}
{2999}{}{All right. Take care, then.}
{3000}{}{Vamos sair.}
{3100}{}{Esqueça que eu disse, idiota.}
{3200}{}{Deixa pra lá então. Pior pra você.}
{4100}{Cas4100}{Ok, está tudo remendado. Estou pronto para ir.}
{4200}{Cas4200}{Ok, praticamente tudo está remendado.}
{4300}{Cas4300}{Eu consegui muito bem, mas eu poderia usar mais alguns estimulantes.}
{4400}{Cas4400}{Usei o que pude, mas ainda estou muito confuso. Se você tiver mais estimulantes sobrando, eu gostaria de usá-los. Mas eu ainda posso andar.}
{9999}{}{Eu gostaria de lhe fazer algumas perguntas...}
{10001}{}{Tome um estimulante e se cure.}
{10002}{}{Cassidy, I need you to wait here until I come back.}
{10003}{}{Coloque sua arma de distância.}
{10004}{}{Ficar perto de mim.}
{10005}{}{Não fique muito longe.}
{10006}{}{Devemos espalhar um pouco.}
{10007}{}{Vamos sair.}
{10100}{}{C'mon, Cassidy. Time to head out.}
{20000}{Cas20000}{Tudo bem, estou ouvindo.}
{20001}{Cas20001}{Meu equipamento? O que tem ele?}
{20002}{Cas20002}{Sem problemas. Muito calor para esse tipo de equipamento, de qualquer forma. Me faz suar como uma prostituta de New Reno.}
{20003}{}{Vamos tentar uma formação diferente.}
{20004}{}{Eu preciso falar com você sobre seu equipamento.}
{20005}{}{Esqueça. Vamos manter a formação que temos agora.}
{20006}{}{Deixa para lá. Não há nada que eu precise saber sobre seu equipamento.}
{20007}{}{Preciso que remova essa armadura que está usando.}
{30000}{}{Ah, isso realmente é bom. Eu sinto que posso manejar com as coisas muito melhor agora.}
{30001}{}{Uau, isso parece diferente. Essas pílulas para o coração devem estar funcionando.}
{30100}{}{Sim, por que não... Vai me ajudar a sentir que estou morto.}
