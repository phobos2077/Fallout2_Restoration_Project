{100}{}{You see Mrs. Bishop.}
{101}{}{You see a screaming Mrs. Bishop.}
{150}{}{You see an attractive middle-aged woman. She looks bored.}
{151}{}{You see Mrs. Bishop. She looks distracted, and she is staring off into the distance.}
{200}{}{(The woman turns to face you. She is quite attractive, with a low cut dress made out of Gold Gecko
 skin. She studies you for a moment, then frowns.) Yes, what is it?}
{201}{}{(Frowns slightly.) Yes? What is it this time?}
{203}{}{Knock-knock}
{204}{}{(Stare at her breasts and drool.)}
{205}{}{Cai fora}
{206}{}{Quem é você?}
{207}{}{I wanted to ask you some questions, Mrs. Bishop.}
{208}{}{Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Goodbye.}
{210}{}{*What?*}
{211}{}{Knock-KNOCK!}
{212}{}{(Stare at her breasts and drool.)}
{215}{}{(Blinks.) Who's there?}
{216}{}{Boo}
{217}{}{Me forget}
{218}{}{Who where?}
{220}{}{(She seems puzzled.) Boo who?}
{221}{}{Boo hoo? No cry, pretty lady! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Hah Hahhh... hoooo... u get it?}
{225}{}{(She glares daggers at you.) Leave at once before I have you shot, you insipid insect.}
{226}{}{Boo... HOO... hee-hee-hee-hee... Boo who? Boo HOO! HA HA HA HA HA...}
{227}{}{Me no instooppid incest...*snfff*...me funneee... MOM sayz so...*snfff*...}
{230}{}{(She follows your eyes down to her breasts. She flushes angrily, opens her mouth... then pauses.) You're
 not terribly bright... (Studies your frame.) However, you are quite... strong. Come with me a moment.}
{231}{}{(She follows your eyes down to her breasts. She flushes angrily, opens her mouth... then pauses.) You're
 not terribly bright... (Studies your face.) However, you do have a certain... charm. Come with me a moment.}
{232}{}{(She follows your eyes down to the curvature of her breasts. Her tone becomes glacial.) Subtlety isn't
 your strong suit, is it? (She looks at you in disgust.) Leave before I have you shot.}
{233}{}{(A segue.)}
{234}{}{We go good place?}
{235}{}{You go. Me stay}
{236}{}{Desliga}
{240}{}{(She smiles faintly.) Yes. *Very* good place. Now come along.}
{245}{}{(She frowns, and her face reddens.) Get out of here before I have you shot.}
{246}{}{Sorreee... me go}
{250}{}{(She raises an eyebrow.) I think *I* should be the one asking that question. (She crosses her arms.)
 I am Leslie Anne Bishop. }
{251}{}{My husband is the head of the Bishop family here in New Reno. And YOU are...?}
{252}{}{My late husband was the head of the Bishop family here in New Reno. And YOU are...?}
{253}{}{Meu nome é }
{254}{}{I am a simple traveler.}
{255}{}{I'm a traveler, looking for Vault 13. Have you heard of it?}
{256}{}{Sou um viajante... você sabe onde posso encontrar um negócio chamado 'Kit de Criação do Jardim do Éden?'}
{257}{}{Look, maybe I better be going. Goodbye.}
{260}{}{Sim?}
{261}{}{Can you tell me about Mr. Bishop?}
{262}{}{Can you tell me about the Bishop Family?}
{263}{}{Have you ever heard of a place called Vault 13?}
{264}{}{Do you know where I could find something called the 'Garden of Eden Creation Kit?'}
{265}{}{Deixa pra lá. É melhor eu ir.}
{270}{}{My husband? That is simple. He is deceased. SUCH a tragedy. I'm still recovering from all the
 champagne I drunk when I heard.}
{271}{}{My husband? He is the head of the Bishop family. In matters of diplomacy, business, and criminal
 pursuits, he possesses a certain animal cunning that one cannot help but admire, however contemptible
 his other qualities.}
{272}{}{Yes, his tactic of hiring those 'raiders' to lean on Vault City seems to be pretty effective.}
{273}{}{Other qualities?}
{275}{}{Sorry I asked. I better be going.}
{276}{}{Sorry, Mrs. Bishop. I didn't mean to pry. I'll leave.}
{280}{}{(She frowns.) I'll leave that to your imagination. (Looks irritated.) Is that *all?*}
{281}{}{Na verdade, eu tinha outras perguntas...}
{285}{}{There really is nothing to say about the Bishop 'Family.' Oh... there is the extended family
 of hired thugs, mercenaries, whores, pushers, and slaves, but that is really all that the Bishop 'family'
 amounts to.}
{286}{}{It sounds as if your marriage life isn't as healthy as it could be.}
{287}{}{Well, there's also that 'family' of mercenaries he hired to raid Vault City.}
{288}{}{Oh. Ei, tenho algumas outras perguntas…}
{295}{}{(She throws an amused glance at your spouse.) And yours is? (She frowns again.) }
{296}{}{No... my late husband was in the business of accumulating power. That seldom leaves room for...
 anything else. }
{297}{}{No... my husband is in the business of accumulating power. That seldom leaves room for... anything
 else. }
{298}{}{In addition, my precious daughter has quickly learned what being a woman means in New Reno.}
{299}{}{Your daughter?}
{300}{}{Your daughter Angela?}
{301}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{305}{}{Yes, the Angela you *slept* with. Surely you remember? (She gives you a withering look.) I *hope* you
 used a prophylactic. Her hormones are so out of control that even the mere mention of sperm would make her
 pregnant.}
{306}{}{Yes, my daughter, Angela. She has become quite the little tramp. (Smiles ruefully.) Like mother, like
 daughter...(Sighs in irritation.) Now, is that *all?*}
{308}{}{Uh, proph... proph-o-lak...? Uh, well, I think we did use one... whatever it is. You know what? I think
 I'm going to go check right now.}
{309}{}{Uh, condom? Sure we did. I think. I mean, I'm pretty sure. Maybe I'll just go check right now.}
{315}{}{'}
{316}{}{(Frowns.) A simple traveler. How remarkably open and trusting of you. And what, pray
 tell, do you think I can do for you, "simple traveler?"}
{321}{}{Nothing, thanks. I really must be going.}
{325}{}{I know where you could find *a* Creation Kit... but it will do you little good. It has
 already been used.}
{326}{}{Where is this Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{328}{}{Then it's no use to me... thanks anyway.}
{330}{}{(Smiles faintly, as if remembering something pleasant.) Have you ever been to Vault City?
 It is northeast of New Reno. They had such a kit... once, long ago, but they used it when they left
 their Vault for the surface.}
{331}{}{Can you tell me about Vault City?}
{332}{}{Posso fazer mais algumas perguntas?}
{333}{}{I'll go check out Vault City then. Thanks for the information.}
{335}{}{(Her smile fades, and her expression becomes hard and distant.) There is not much to tell.
 I think you'll find the climate there... different. Now, is that all?}
{336}{}{No, actually, I had some other questions...}
{337}{}{Yes, it is. Sorry to bother you.}
{340}{}{As I said, there is Vault City to the northeast. Is that the place you are referring to?}
{341}{}{I know of Vault *City* to the northeast. Is that the place you are referring to?}
{342}{}{No. Wrong place.}
{343}{}{It could be.}
{345}{}{Might be... I'll go check it out. Thanks.}
{350}{}{Hmnnn. Well then, I'm afraid that I can't help you.}
{352}{}{Do you know anyone who might know?}
{353}{}{Sim, certo... obrigado de qualquer forma.}
{354}{}{Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Bishop. I appreciate it.}
{360}{}{You might want to head there, then.}
{362}{}{All right then, I'll go check it out.}
{363}{}{Very well, thanks for your time. I appreciate it.}
{370}{}{Dear boy... }
{371}{}{Dear girl... }
{372}{}{the people of Reno have enough difficulty remembering which whore they left their
 cocks in when they wake in the morning, much less know where to find anything such as what
 you describe.}
{374}{}{All right... I was just asking. Later, then.}
{375}{}{Very well. Thanks for your time.}
{380}{}{Hold on a moment. (Studies you.) You seem to be... new in town. Would you care to join
 me for a drink in my chambers? We can discuss New Reno; it's a dangerous place to those
 unfamiliar with its ways.}
{381}{}{A moment before you leave. (She studies you again.) Do you have the time for that
 drink now? Or must you dash off again?}
{382}{}{Only if the drinks are just the beginning.}
{383}{}{Sure. A drink would be welcome.}
{384}{}{I'm sorry, Mrs. Bishop, but I'm married.}
{385}{}{No, thanks. I really have to go.}
{386}{}{No way. I don't want to make your husband... upset.}
{387}{}{I work for your husband, Mrs. Bishop. It wouldn't be right.}
{390}{}{(She raises an eyebrow.) We shall see.}
{391}{}{Well, that's all I need to hear. Let's go.}
{392}{}{Sra. Bishop, sinto muito, mas tenho que recusar... desta vez.}
{393}{}{I'm sorry, but I can't, Mrs. Bishop. I really have to be going.}
{394}{}{No way. I have no desire to cross your husband.}
{400}{}{(She laughs.) You flatter yourself. It's merely a drink. }
{401}{}{And IF anything were to happen, I assure you, my husband is QUITE dead. }
{402}{}{And IF anything were to happen, I assure you, my husband is NOT the jealous type. }
{404}{}{Sra. Bishop, sinto muito, mas ainda tenho que recusar... desta vez.}
{410}{}{(She raises an eyebrow.) My husband may be dead, but his men are at my disposal.
 They can become quite... irate... when an invitation from Mrs. Bishop is refused. Are you
 *quite* certain you will not join me?}
{411}{}{(She raises an eyebrow.) My husband is not the jealous type, but he can become
 quite... irate... when a gracious invitation from a Bishop family member is refused. Are you
 *quite* certain you will not join me?}
{412}{}{I still have to say no.}
{413}{}{Okay. Just a drink, then.}
{414}{}{Look, I have to go, Mrs. Bishop.}
{415}{}{(She frowns.) Leave then. If we cross paths again, rest assured that I will not
 be the least bit interested in talking to you.}
{416}{}{All right then... goodbye.}
{420}{}{(She nods and smiles.) Very well. Follow me.}
{425}{}{Return at some point, then. The offer is a standing invitation.}
{426}{}{Uh... okay. Goodbye.}
{430}{}{We have nothing to say to each other. Leave before I summon the guards.}
{435}{}{(Mrs. Bishop smiles slightly when she sees you.) Why, hello again. Is there
 something I can do for you?}
{436}{}{I'd like to join you for that drink now, if you have the time, Mrs. Bishop.}
{437}{}{I'd like to join you for another... drink, if you have the time, Mrs. Bishop.}
{438}{}{Eu tenho algumas perguntas…}
{439}{}{Not at the moment, thanks. I have to go.}
{440}{}{So? So am I. What are you suggesting that my invitation is? Some sort of prelude
 to adultery? Come now, don't be foolish. Now, are you coming?}
{441}{}{Okay, then. Just a drink.}
{443}{}{I'm sorry, but I can't, Mrs. Bishop. I really have to go.}
{445}{}{Oh, yes... my husband's well thought-out attempt at forcing others to accept his
 gesture of good will. I had rather hoped those raiders had been incinerated by Vault
 City's laser cannons.}
{446}{}{"Gesture of good will?"}
{447}{}{Entendo. Eu tenho outras perguntas...}
{448}{}{Interesting... well, thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{449}{}{Hmmm... interesting. Thanks for your time, Mrs. Bishop.}
{450}{}{Yes. His initial offer of an alliance were refused, so he reiterated his peaceful
 intentions by using violence to drive Vault City into submission... through an intermediary,
 of course.}
{451}{}{Well, I was wondering about that. Wouldn't Vault City turn to someone else for help
 rather than agree to join with Bishop?}
{452}{}{Well, I was wondering about that. Wouldn't Vault City turn to someone else for
 help... like NCR... rather than agree to join with Bishop?}
{453}{}{Do you have any proof of this?}
{460}{}{(She smirks.) Well, aren't *you* a sharp one...}
{461}{}{So? Do you know what Bishop has planned?}
{462}{}{Well, sometimes... depending on who you ask. I had some other questions...}
{470}{}{(Frowns.) No. Should I? (Studies you carefully, then smirks.) }
{471}{}{(Frowns.) No. Should I? (Studies you carefully, then smirks again.) }
{472}{}{You certainly do ask a lot of dangerous questions about my husband's business.
 I'd be *very* careful if I were you.}
{473}{}{Uh, thanks for the advice. I had some other, safer, questions...}
{474}{}{Eu vou. Adeus.}
{475}{}{Thanks for your time... and your advice, Mrs. Bishop.}
{480}{}{*Suspiro*}
{481}{}{Another BEAUTIFUL Reno day. The devil must be dancing a jig.}
{482}{}{Judging from the crowd in the casino, looks like more human sewage has washed into Reno...}
{483}{}{Reno... "the biggest little cesspool in the world." Hmmmph.}
{490}{}{You see Mrs. Bishop, who is currently asleep. She is smiling contentedly.}
{491}{}{You see Mrs. Bishop, who is currently asleep. As you
 watch, she sighs contentedly and turns in her sleep.}
{500}{}{You see Mrs. Bishop. It's hard to concentrate on her appearance while she is
 shouting for the guards.}
{510}{}{Mmmmm... oh, }
{511}{}{Mmmzrrmnmn....again, }
{512}{}{Combinnnazion t'safe... }
{515}{}{Intruder! Help!}
{516}{}{Thief! Thief!}
{517}{}{Intruder! Guards! Guards!}
{520}{}{(She takes you upstairs to a strange, nice-smelling room. Once there, she starts
 giving you strange directions that make you feel both happy and uncomfortable.) Don't you
 want to touch me?}
{521}{}{hã-ham.}
{522}{}{hã-hã}
{525}{}{Hmmmm. Very well. Just lay down on the bed then and I'll do the rest.}
{526}{}{Me refuse me no WANT to me want to go HOME to Arroyo-yo}
{527}{}{Do what she tells you to.}
{530}{}{(She takes a big breath of air, then she starts yelling so loud it hurts your ears!
 Something about 'gards' and 'theef' which you can't make out because she's yelling so loudly.)}
{531}{}{Shhh! Se você não ficar em silêncio, George não me deixará brincar com os coelhos! Shhh!}
{532}{}{Whatz wrong with yor teef? What you need gardz for?}
{533}{}{No screem! No screem!}
{535}{}{Yes, I know; gossip travels quickly in Reno. (Sighs.) No matter... I think you'll
 find that I am much more experienced in the ways of pleasuring a man than she is.
 (Pauses.) You DID use a prophylactic, didn't you?}
{536}{}{A pro... prof-o... a condom?}
{537}{}{Condom?}
{538}{}{Yeah, it got used from my inventory. I didn't know what had happened to it at
 first, but I figured it out.}
{539}{}{Um... I REALLY should be going, Mrs. Bishop.}
{540}{}{Yes, a *condom.* (Glares at you.) Great. Just great. (Shrugs.) Oh, well. Maybe
 I'll have a grandson. Oh, well. Stop talking and come here.}
{541}{}{Yeah, it's not as obvious as you'd think. Designer humor, I bet. (Shrugs.) Oh,
 well. Stop talking and come here.}
{542}{}{More experienced than Angela, you said? This I HAVE to see.}
{543}{}{I got to go.}
{545}{}{(You join Mrs. Bishop for a drink in her chambers. The two of you talk for a
 while, then she comes over and starts caressing you.)}
{546}{}{[Go to it.]}
{547}{}{Embrace her...}
{548}{}{Uh, Mrs. Bishop, I slept with your daughter. Maybe we shouldn't...}
{549}{}{Before we "do" it, aren't you going to open your wall safe like your daught
 - er, as is customary?}
{550}{}{Look, I really should be going, Mrs. Bishop.}
{555}{}{No. Now come here.}
{556}{}{[Go to it.]}
{557}{}{Look, I REALLY have to go, Mrs. Bishop.}
{560}{}{Oh?! Where do you have to go right now?}
{561}{}{Anywhere.}
{562}{}{I have to meet Jules by the front for a... special transaction.}
{563}{}{I have to go meet a friend and can't be late.}
{564}{}{My reasons are my own. Goodbye, Mrs. Bishop.}
{565}{}{You try and leave this room, and I'll scream for the guards.}
{566}{}{All things considered, I'm probably safer with the guards. Goodbye.}
{567}{}{I have to meet Jules at the front of town for a... special transaction... very soon.}
{569}{}{All right, all right. I just wish you wouldn't play so hard to get. Come here.}
{570}{}{I just want you to know this is wrong, and if I had stronger moral fiber, I'd
 give you a stern lecture. Now come here.}
{575}{}{Guards! An intruder! Thief! Guards! Intruder in the penthouse!}
{576}{}{Where? What are you talking about, Mrs. Bishop?}
{577}{}{Fuck! I hate this game!}
{580}{}{Fine. If you won't sleep with me this time, I want you to know that you can
 come see me anytime you want, and we'll make some kind of arrangement. Do you
 understand what I said?}
{581}{}{Yes. Now let me out.}
{582}{}{Yes, I understand.}
{585}{}{(You both leave the room, and Mrs. Bishop escorts you out. You both descend
 back to the second floor.)}
{586}{}{Whew.}
{590}{}{(You make love. It's not the best. It's not the greatest. But, for a brief
 moment in your turbulent lives, you and Mrs. Bishop forget the cruelties of the
 world and lose yourselves in each other...) }
{591}{}{(Passionate lovemaking commences. At the end of your sexual marathon, Mrs.
 Bishop curls up against you, smiling contentedly.) Mmmmm, }
{592}{}{You are the *man.* (Shivers.) That thing with your tongue was --}
{593}{}{You are the *woman.* (Shivers.) That thing with your tongue was --}
{594}{}{So... what do you want to do now?}
{595}{}{Mmmmm, Leslie.}
{596}{}{Uh, look, just in CASE someone is watching us from above right now and listening
 to everything we say and do, let's keep some secrets to ourselves. Instead, let's
 indulge in some distracting pillow talk.}
{600}{}{(Mrs. Bishop sighs contentedly and stretches.)}
{601}{}{Tell me about your husband.}
{602}{}{Tell me about your daughter.}
{603}{}{Tell me about your family.}
{604}{}{You're not from New Reno, are you, Mrs. Bishop? You talk differently than
 a lot of people around here.}
{605}{}{Are you from Vault City?}
{606}{}{Look, I better go, Mrs. Bishop.}
{610}{}{(Mrs. Bishop frowns slightly and pulls the sheets tighter around her body.)
 MUST we talk about him? Let's not ruin the mood.}
{611}{}{I really want to know. Tell me about him.}
{612}{}{Okay, then, how about...}
{615}{}{(She laughs.) Who cares? John's dead. Long live John! The bastard...}
{616}{}{Ha! I assure you John and I have no love for each other. What small fraction
 existed has degenerated into a healthy amount of spite. He has his women, and I have
 my... pleasures.}
{617}{}{Surely you two must still love each other, if even a little.}
{618}{}{What's the deal with him and NCR?}
{619}{}{What is the deal with him and these 'raiders' I've been hearing about?}
{620}{}{Do you know what the combination to Bishop's safe is?}
{621}{}{How about we talk about something else...}
{625}{}{(Frowns.) I'll leave that to your imagination. Can we *please* drop it? Let's
 talk about something else.}
{630}{}{Want me to kill him?}
{635}{}{Oh... that. Well...*yawn*...I think John wants to get in good with themmmm...
 (stretches) ...and then get their help to wipe out the other families.}
{636}{}{Is that all Bishop wants from NCR?}
{637}{}{Okay, then, let's talk about something else...}
{638}{}{I wanted to know some other things about what John's been up to...}
{645}{}{(Rolls over.) John sent some mercenaries East, near Vault City to 'lean'
 on the city. Wants to try and apply pressure on 'em, make them beg NCR for help.}
{646}{}{Beg *NCR* for help? Why?}
{650}{}{Mmmmm... oh... well... (Turns over.) John promised NCR he'd give Vault City to them.
 So he sent out some of his men, told them to act like raiders until Vault City caved.}
{651}{}{Do you know where these raiders are?}
{652}{}{Uh... is there any PROOF of this anywhere?}
{655}{}{No... John probably has a map of their location somewhere around here...
 (Sniffs slightly, rubs nose.) Mmmmm....}
{657}{}{Let's talk about something else...}
{660}{}{, Eu acho... algo assim...}
{663}{}{Excellent... time to go crack a safe... sleep well, Mrs. Bishop.}
{665}{}{Oh, }
{666}{}{Oh. Thanks.}
{670}{}{(Frowns.) What *about* her? }
{671}{}{If you're going to talk about the two of you fornicating, I *don't* want
 to hear it. For your sake, I hope you used a condom. }
{672}{}{Little tramp'll sleep with any tribal that shakes his peace pipe at her...}
{673}{}{Uh... well... let's talk about something else...}
{675}{}{(Shrugs slightly.) Nothing to say. Bunch of hired thugs, mercenaries,
 whores, pushers, and slaves...(Rolls over.) ...that's the Bishop 'family.' Wish
 I'd never hooked up with John...}
{677}{}{Hmmmm. I had some other questions...}
{680}{}{And yours is? Hmmmph. }
{681}{}{No, my 'marriage' was not a healthy one. My late husband was in the business
 of accumulating power, and that seldom leaves any room for... anything else.}
{682}{}{No, my 'marriage' is not a healthy one. My husband is in the business of power,
 and that seldom leaves any room for... anything else.}
{683}{}{You sound unhappy. You should leave here, go somewhere else.}
{684}{}{Hmmm. Eu tenho outras perguntas…}
{690}{}{Why, what a BRILLIANT idea! And where would I go? Into the Wastes to live
 amongst the savages? South, to NCR? Northwest, to Redding, to rent my body to miners?}
{691}{}{Why is leaving Reno so impossible? You're not a stupid woman. I would think
 that you could pick up any trade you put your mind to.}
{692}{}{Nevermind then. Look, I had some other questions...}
{700}{}{I leave, and my husband will bring me back. The Family watches out for their
 own, whether they want to be watched or not.}
{701}{}{Hmmm. Perhaps I will... now that John had his much-deserved accident.
 (Smiles ruefully.) Maybe I will at that. Reno has become... tiresome. (Thinks.)
 Or maybe it just needs new management...}
{702}{}{Say, I had some other questions...}
{705}{}{No. (She rolls over, mumbles in her sleep.) Don't be an idiot. Soon as people
 find out, you'll be on the run for the rest of your short life.}
{706}{}{But what if people didn't know it was me?}
{710}{}{(She stirs, blinks.) What are you TALKING about? Don't talk foolish.}
{711}{}{I don't know, maybe a trap? Or something that looks like an accident?}
{712}{}{All right. Look, I had some other questions...}
{715}{}{(Her eyes snap open.) His safe... he has explosives set up to it if it's tampered
 with. Only if you enter a certain combination is it safe. Of course, if that combination
 was changed... "fixed"... without his knowledge...}
{716}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe if I "repaired" the lock on his safe... It's something to keep in mind.
 Say, I had some other questions...}
{720}{}{No, I *don't* talk like everyone around here. It's called an 'education.' (She
 rolls over.) Go to sleep.}
{721}{}{Where could I get an education?}
{725}{}{*Yawn*... You're already as smart as I want you to be... now go to sleep. If you're
 pumping me for information, then you're creating a deficit.}
{726}{}{Deficit? Here in the bed? I did not!}
{730}{}{(Cracks open one eye.) Who told you that?}
{731}{}{I guessed after I heard you talk about Vault City. You got this nostalgic look
 in your eye.}
{735}{}{(Her expression crumbles for a moment, then she rolls over so you can't see her.)
 Don't mention that place.}
{736}{}{O que aconteceu?}
{740}{}{JOHN happened. I used to live there. He visited once, I was pleasantly charmed because he was so... rough, I guess. Different from most Vault Citizens. Of course, he let me try some drugs and... (Sighs.)}
{741}{}{E?}
{745}{}{They had memory enhancers for the Pip-Boys there. Had dictionaries
 and encyclopedias stored on them. Took one of the lingual enhancers when I left, though I don't know why.}
{746}{}{Where is this enhancer?}
{750}{}{*Yawn*... (Curls up.) It's in my safe. Not much use without a Pip-Boy, though.
 Don't know why I still keep it.}
{751}{}{Can I have it?}
{752}{}{Hmmmnn. I had some other questions...}
{760}{}{(Shrugs.) Sure, if you want them. Combination is }
{761}{}{How do I use it?}
{762}{}{Thanks. Say, I had some other questions...}
{770}{}{(Mrs. Bishop rolls over and closes her eyes. In a few seconds, she's asleep.)}
{771}{}{Quietly slip out of bed and get dressed.}
{780}{}{The only 'love' we have consists of his forcing his way into my bedroom and
 mounting me like a drunken brahmin. And that is perhaps his least contemptible
 quality, considering his other pursuits.}
{781}{}{Other pursuits?}
{790}{}{He also probably wants a say in who controls the drug trade in the new California
 Republic... him. He's been looking into rigging elections down soooouth... *yawn*}
{791}{}{So he's actually planning to have Reno JOIN the Republic... hmmmm. Okay, then,
 let's talk about something else...}
{792}{}{Interesting. I wanted to know some other things about what John's been up to...}
{800}{}{Drugs are illegal in Vault City, of course. The other Citizens found out and revoked my Citizenship. John was the only one I could turn to... he knew that, of course. He'd planned the whole thing.}
{801}{}{So you got your education in Vault City? That's why you sound different than
 everyone else here in New Reno?}
{810}{}{Just attach the headgear, place the optic sensor over your right eye, then connect
 the other end... hmpphh... (Rolls over.) ..to the Pip-Boy. You'll feel a slight rush,
 some nausea, then your head will feel... clearer.}

 Soft snores begin to emanate from her body.)}
{826}{}{(Finish up, then leave.)}
{900}{}{You have convinced Mrs. Bishop that she can change her life... for the better.}

 His safe is trapped. So be careful, all right? You are no good to me with no
 fingers. (Smiles, rolls back over.)}
{1760}{}{. The enhancer is in a compartment in the bottom of the safe... a thief isn't
 going to find it unless they know what to look for.}

{2511}{}{... mmm}
