{101}{}{Você vê um membro da tribo.}
{102}{}{You see Marli.}
{103}{}{You see a warrior with a scowl on his face.}
{110}{}{Be gone. I'm seeking council with the spirits and they don't like you, outworlder. If you must speak to me, do it another time.}
{111}{}{No need to be so rude. Bye.}
{112}{}{Hmph. I didn't ask for your help, outworlder. I could have taken care of the well myself.}
{113}{}{Right. No thanks required.}
{114}{}{Whatever. Way to be ungrateful.}
{120}{}{O que você quer?}
{121}{}{I see you're having some trouble with that well. What's wrong, exactly?}
{130}{}{What's wrong? I dropped the rope, that's what's wrong. [He shifts uncomfortably.] I was fastening a new rope to the well and then I looked up and saw this fine young maiden stretching in the sunlight. Spirits of lust distracted me and the rope slipped from my hands and... What's it to you anyway, outworlder? Unless you got a new rope for me, you be wasting my time.}
{131}{}{I don't have a rope on me, but I'll see if I can come up with one. I'll get back to you.}
{132}{}{As a matter of fact, I do. I'll see if I can fix that well for you.}
{133}{}{Nope, I'm afraid you're just going to have to admit to the others what happened. Try to keep your spirits of lust under control next time. Bye.}
{140}{}{So is the well fixed yet, or what?}
{141}{}{No, not yet I'm afraid.}
{142}{}{Está olhando o que? Você está parado ao lado dessa porra, idiota.}
{150}{}{Então, você já consertou o poço?}
{151}{}{Sure, I got the rope in place now. See?}
{160}{}{[He glances at the well, then snickers.] What good is a rope if you don't have a bucket attached? Or do you outworlders drink by licking water off a wet rope? [He shakes his head and mutters something under his breath.] Just attach the bucket, and I'll see that you be gettin' a reward.}
{161}{}{Certo.}
{162}{}{How 'bout *you* reattach the bucket, and I'll see if I can restrain myself from beating your ass.}
{170}{}{Did you attach the bucket?}
{171}{}{Não, ainda não.}
{172}{}{Does it *look* like I attached the bucket?}
{180}{}{So the well is fixed, yes? With the bucket attached and everything?}
{181}{}{Yes, it's all done.}
{182}{}{...}
{190}{}{[The corner of his mouth twitches up into a hint of a smile.] Ah, I suppose you outworlders aren't all bad, after all. Here, take this money. The spirits tell me you be needing this more than I.}
{191}{}{Obrigado.}
{200}{}{May your ancestors guide you well.}
{201}{}{Obrigado por sua ajuda.}
{202}{}{Nice to be seeing you again.}
{210}{}{You won't take us alive, slaver!}
{300}{}{All right, calm your spirits of anger. I'll do it myself. [He mumbles.] Crazy outworlder...}
{301}{}{[FEITO]}
{310}{}{[He narrows his eyes at you, then glances at the well.] No.}
{311}{}{Then no, I guess I didn't attach it yet.}
{320}{}{Hey, did you hear me? I asked if the well be fixed yet.}
{321}{}{... [You sigh, then point at the well.]}
{330}{}{[He turns and looks at the well, then turns back to you.] Yeah, looks right an' proper now. Why not just say so? Here, take this money. The spirits tell me you be needing this more than I.}
{331}{}{... [You take the money and walk away.]}
{400}{}{[As you're about to walk away, Marli looks at you closely and his eyes light up.] Ah! I see you have sub-machine gun. [He gazes longingly at the weapon.] We had one once, but Sulik always be hogging it. Got lost in a battle. Such a pity. My magic would be fearsome strong if I had a soul-taker such as that.}
{401}{}{If you want this one, you can have it. I'm sure I'll find another. [Hand Marli the SMG.]}
{402}{}{Just take it. I don't even want it after the eye raping you're giving it. [Hand Marli the SMG.]}
{403}{}{Yeah, I bet. Anyway, me and my soul-taker are going elsewhere now.}
{404}{}{You keep your magic to yourself, pal. Bye.}
{410}{}{[He grins like a maniac as he looks over the weapon.] Oh, you be a good friend to Marli, outworlder. Here, was saving this sweet bubble-water, but I think you should be having it. [He hands you a Nuka-Cola.] Now I be off to spit fiery death at some geckos. [He runs off to the hunting grounds.]}
{411}{}{My magic be fearsome now!}
{1000}{}{You fix the Tribe's well.}
{2000}{}{Sorry if I was a jerk to you, hero.}
{2001}{}{Sorry, I lost your sub-machine gun. That gecko be a fierce one.}
