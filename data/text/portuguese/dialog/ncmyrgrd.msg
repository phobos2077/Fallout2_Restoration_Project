{151}{}{You see one of Myron's bored-looking guards.}
{152}{}{You see one of Myron's bored-looking guards. He looks like he would rather be anywhere else.}
{200}{}{Touch my shit again, and I'll kill you.}
{205}{}{Go on in. Everything's cool.}
{206}{}{Head on in. It's cool.}
{210}{}{Grab for that door again, and you'll pull away a stump.}
{211}{}{Get away from there.}
{215}{}{Hey, Myron. You takin' a walk?}
{216}{}{Watch yourself, Myron.}
{217}{}{Don't get into any trouble, Myron, awright?}
{218}{}{Don't go too far, Myron.}
{225}{}{Ei, }
{230}{}{It's one of the }

{245}{}{Guarda essa arma... A não ser que você PROCURE problemas.}
{250}{}{Intruso!}
{260}{}{Tire essa lixeira rolante daqui.}
{261}{}{Robôs não são permitidos aqui. Caia fora.}
{262}{}{Esse robô vai virar sucata se ficar aqui.}
{270}{}{I *thought* I smelled mutant. Get him outta here 'fore we get mad.}
{271}{}{Gostas de mutantes? O lugar dele é LÁ FORA. Ou então...}
{272}{}{Esse mutante quer virar alvo de tiro? Continue aqui e ele vai ter o desejo realizado.}
{280}{}{Eu *pensei* sentir cheiro de algo podre. Tire esse seu ghoul daqui.}
{281}{}{Get that stinky ghoul mother fucker outta here. Now.}
{282}{}{Se esse ghoul não sair daqui em um minuto, vai ficar mais morto do que já está.}
{290}{}{::Whoa.:: Check THAT out.}
{291}{}{Hey, chica, you looking for some company?}
{292}{}{Wanna waste some time with us, chica?}
{293}{}{::Howls like a wolf when he sees you:: Awooooooo!}
{300}{}{What the hell do you want, slaver? Slaves are upstairs.}
{305}{}{What happened to Myron?}
{310}{}{Myron still sleeping it off?}
{311}{}{I'm bored.}
{312}{}{Viu a luta de ontem a noite?}
{313}{}{Can't wait until this shift is over.}
{320}{}{Help you with somthin', amigo? This area's off-limits.}
{321}{}{Well, well, well... we got us a star in our midst. You got an appointment with Myron, chica?}
{322}{}{Help you with somthin', chica? This area's off-limits.}
{323}{}{(The guard smiles, looks you up and down.) Got an appointment with Myron, chica?}
{324}{}{Quero a paz mundial}
{325}{}{Me want to go past door}
{326}{}{Quem você.}
{327}{}{Cai fora}
{328}{}{Off-Limits? What's behind that door?}
{329}{}{I'm here to see Myron.}
{330}{}{I'm here to see Myron. I have a badge.}
{331}{}{I'm here to see Myron. Me and him got a "special appointment," see?}
{332}{}{Sure do. You gonna keep me standing here, handsome, or have your eyes had their fill yet?}
{333}{}{I'm sorry? What appointment?}
{334}{}{Sorry, wrong room. I'll be going now.}
{350}{}{You escape from your stall, slave? Maybe you better get your ass back upstairs before we put you in one
 of the cages.}
{351}{}{EU QUERO PAZ MUNDIAL EU QUERO PAZ MUNDIAL}
{352}{}{ME SAY ME WANT TO GO PAST DOOR}
{353}{}{QUEM VOCÊ.}
{354}{}{[Shamble off]}
{360}{}{(Readies weapon.) I'm gonna enjoy this. I ain't beaten a slave for at least an hour...}
{361}{}{(Readies weapon.) I'm gonna enjoy this. I ain't killed no one for two days...}
{362}{}{VOCÊ SERÁ UMA PESSOA FERIDA.}
{363}{}{ SMASH}
{364}{}{[Try and run.]}
{365}{}{Pal, you're about to get the ass whipping of a life time.}
{370}{}{(Sneers.) Sorry. "Need-ta-know" basis. Now get lost... amigo.}
{371}{}{(Sneers.) Sorry. "Need-ta-know" basis. Now get lost, chica.}
{374}{}{Let me by. I have to get past that door.}
{375}{}{Tudo bem, tudo certo.}
{380}{}{Oh, you ARE, are you? Well, goddamn, why didn't you say something earlier? We could have avoided
 this talk altogether, and I could have told you to piss off right from the start.}
{381}{}{Myron's expecting me. You better let me see him, or you'll hear about it later.}
{390}{}{Nah. You ain't gonna see him. Now piss off before you make me angry.}
{391}{}{Can you at least give him a message for me?}
{400}{}{Nope. Now piss OFF, you little shit.}
{401}{}{I'm staying until you let me in. In fact, I'd like to see you TRY and move me.}
{402}{}{I'm staying until you let me in. In fact, I'd like to see you sorry sacks of shit TRY and move me.}
{404}{}{Tudo certo.}
{411}{}{Vamos ver isso...}
{412}{}{Defend yourself.}
{425}{}{Yeah? Lemme see. Hmmmm. (Checks badge, shrugs.) All right, but keep it quick. Myron's busy, and he don't
 like being disturbed.}
{426}{}{Tenho-o.}
{435}{}{(Eyes roam up and down your body.) Yeah, for now... heh heh... though, I might need ANOTHER fill a little
 later on. When you're done inside, that is.}
{436}{}{Eu... vou manter isso em mente. Posso entrar?}
{437}{}{We'll see, all right?}
{445}{}{Sure, sweetheart. Head on in.}
{446}{}{Yeah, head on in.}
{447}{}{Obrigado.}
{455}{}{You? Ha! Chica, unless Myron suddenly went blind, you ain't going in there. I know his tastes, right?
 He ain't interested in any skanky Jet-begging whore.}
{457}{}{Look, I'm here to see Myron. I have a badge.}
{458}{}{Eu vou estar indo agora.}
{465}{}{Oh, sorry. Thought you were someone else. What do you want, chica?}
{466}{}{O que há atrás daquela porta?}
{475}{}{Myron expecting you?}
{477}{}{Yes. Can I head on in? We have business to discuss.}
{478}{}{No, not right now. Take care, you guys.}
{479}{}{Yes. Can I head on in? We have "business" to discuss. If you know what I mean. (You wink at the guard.)}
{480}{}{Heh, I sure do. Try not to make too much of a ruckus while you're here. (To himself) Damn, Myron's such a lucky
 man.)}
{485}{}{Myron ain't in.}
{487}{}{Can I head in anyway?}
{495}{}{(Shrugs.) I don't care. If you wanna wait for him, go ahead. I don't know when he's gonna be back... or if
 he is gonna be back.}
{5225}{}{! Whazzup?}
{5230}{}{s! Waste 'em!}
{5236}{}{ man who don't know when he's about to die.}
{5240}{}{ kennel, puta?}
{5241}{}{ bitch who don't know when she's about to die.}
{5476}{}{! Myron's right behind that door. He expecting you?}
{5486}{}{, whatzzup? Oh, hey... Myron ain't in.}
