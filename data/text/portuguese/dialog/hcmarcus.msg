{100}{}{Você vê um velho mutante corpulento.}
{101}{}{Você vê Marcus, o Mutante, xerife de Broken Hills.}
{102}{}{Você vê um velho mutante corpulento com um rosto cansado. Ele ainda parece vigoroso e resistente.}
{103}{mcs1a}{Bem, olha só. Fazia muito tempo que não via uma dessas roupas. Me trás recordações.}
{104}{mcs1b}{O que você quer, humano?}
{105}{mcs1c}{Você queria algo mais?}
{106}{}{Feio.}
{107}{}{Quem é você?}
{108}{}{Qual é a história desse lugar?}
{109}{}{Por que os mutantes não estão me atacando?}
{110}{}{Quais as novidades?}
{111}{}{Tenho algo que eu queria te dizer.}
{112}{}{Quer viajar comigo?}
{113}{}{Adeus.}
{114}{mcs3}{Sim, eu sou um mutante feio. Eu também tomo conta deste lugar. Algum problema com isso?}
{115}{}{Uh!}
{116}{}{Nuh.}
{117}{mcs4}{Quer lutar contra mim?}
{118}{}{Uh!}
{119}{}{Nuh.}
{120}{mcs5}{Mostre seu melhor golpe, humano.}
{121}{mcs6a}{Bom.}
{122}{mcs6b}{Mantenha seu nariz fora de onde não te interessa e você não terá problemas.}
{123}{}{Uh?}
{124}{mcs7}{Eu sou Marcus. Ajudei a construir esse lugar e agora sou o xerife.}
{125}{}{Você ajudou a construir este lugar? Isso deve ter sido há muito tempo...}
{126}{}{Besteira. Como você pode ter vivido tanto tempo?}
{127}{}{Adeus.}
{128}{mcs8}{Longa história. Quer um resumo ou a história completa?}
{129}{}{Pode me fazer um resumo.}
{130}{}{Estou de boa agora, pode me contar tudo, quero ouvir.}
{131}{}{Nem um nem outro. Eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{132}{}{Nem um nem outro. Nos vemos depois.}
{133}{mcs9}{Muito bem. Eu, junto com um humano chamado Jacob, construímos este lugar ao redor da velha margem cerca de 60 anos atrás. Todos são bem-vindos aqui, desde que mantenham a paz.}
{134}{}{Grande. Eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{135}{}{Me parece justo. Tchau.}
{136}{mcs10}{Certo... Depois da destruição do Mestre, seus tonéis e sua base, eu vaguei sem um rumo pelo deserto. Um dia fui atacado por um maluco vestindo uma power armor.}
{137}{}{Realmente?}
{138}{mcs11}{Esse era Jacob, membro da Irmandade do Aço. Ele fez algum juramento em destruir os mutantes. Nós lutamos um tempo - talvez um dia ou dois. Mas depois de pensar, começamos a rir. Qual era o sentido nisso?}
{139}{}{Então o que ?}
{140}{mcs12}{Nós nos tornamos amigos e partimos juntos. Outras pessoas também começaram a nos seguir. Acho que eles perceberam que se não estivessem seguros com um super mutante e um cavaleiro da irmandade, eles não estariam seguros em lugar nenhum. }
{141}{}{Então você se estabeleceu por aqui. Por quê?}
{142}{mcs13}{Mina de urânio. De acordo com mapas antigos elas ficavam por aqui. Agora, qualquer um é bem-vindo aqui - desde que aja corretamente. O resto do mundo pode o que quiser, mas ninguém é mais livre do que nós aqui.}
{143}{}{Espere... você era amigo de um cara da Irmandade?}
{144}{}{O que, você não está mais matando humanos?}
{145}{}{Obrigado. Preciso ir, tchau.}
{146}{mcs14}{Oh, de que buraco você saiu? Mutantes e normais fizeram as pazes há muito tempo.}
{147}{}{Eu sou de uma vila fundada pelo Morador da Vault original.}
{148}{}{De uma aldeia a noroeste.}
{149}{}{Oh, erro meu. Bem, obrigado. Tchau.}
{150}{mcs15a}{Noticias… noticias…}
{151}{mcs15b}{Well, gettin' kind of worried about one of our caravan guys. Chad. He might be skimming. You up to checking him out for me?}
{152}{}{O quê tem pra mim?}
{153}{}{Sure. I'll do it.}
{154}{}{I'm a little busy.}
{155}{}{You have anything else?}
{156}{mcs16}{My undying gratitude. Right?}
{157}{}{Good enough for me.}
{158}{}{No good. I want something.}
{159}{}{Que tal algumas perguntas enquanto eu penso sobre isso.}
{160}{}{Let me think about it. Bye.}
{161}{mcs17}{That ain't good enough for you? Then get out.}
{162}{}{Adeus.}
{163}{mcs18}{Got a little trouble with the mine. If you're interested in helping fix it, go talk to Zaius, the mine foreman.}
{164}{}{Aonde eu posso encontrá-lo?}
{165}{}{You got anything else?}
{166}{}{Eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{167}{}{Maybe later. Bye.}
{168}{mcs19}{Usually at the mine. Sometimes the saloon.}
{169}{}{Got anything else?}
{170}{}{Eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{171}{}{Adeus.}
{172}{mcs20}{Somebody busted two lunatics out of the jail in the bank. Find 'em. Tell me and I'll stuff 'em back in.}
{173}{}{Got anything else?}
{174}{}{Eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{175}{}{Adeus.}
{176}{mcs21}{What exactly do you want? Okay. We've got some folks missing. No idea what's happened. Find 'em, get $500.}
{177}{}{I'll do it for free.}
{178}{}{$500? Sounds good.}
{179}{}{I don't have time.}
{180}{}{Eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{181}{}{Adeus.}
{182}{mcs22}{Great. Let me know when you've found something, right?}
{183}{}{Certo. Eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{184}{}{Vai fazer. Tchau.}
{185}{mcs23}{Yeah? What?}
{186}{}{You wanted me to find those missing people. I've found some tunnels below the city. They might be there.}
{187}{}{I've found those missing people. They're in tunnels beneath the city.}
{188}{}{Those two escaped convicts? They're in cahoots with Jacob and Aileen. They're hiding out around Jacob's Drugstore.}
{189}{}{Jacob and Aileen asked me to break two people out of jail. I think they've got a plan how to do it.}
{190}{}{Jacob and Aileen want me to blow up the mine. Thought you might want to know.}
{191}{}{A scientist from NCR wants to try an experimental drug that'll wipe out mutants. Be careful of what you eat and drink.}
{192}{}{It looks like you were right about Chad skimming money. He lied to the Gecko rep about a miners' strike to justify a price hike. I'm guessing he's pocketing the profit.}
{193}{}{Chad kept about $1000 from the last uranium shipment for himself. He's planning on bailing outta town. I got a briefcase of documents to prove it.}
{194}{}{Nada. Esqueça.}
{195}{mcs24}{Tunnels under the city? Guess it's not that surprising with the mines around. You'll keep looking around for those folks, right? }
{196}{}{Certo.}
{197}{mcs25a}{They're dead? Damn... I'll tell the families myself. }
{198}{mcs25b}{Here's your reward. $500. Thanks for your time.}
{199}{mcs25c}{Oh, hey, I know you said you'd do this for free, but take this as our thanks.}
{200}{}{Com certeza.}
{201}{mcs26}{Right. Me and my deputies will take it from here... And, thanks. I don't forget things like this.}
{202}{}{No prob. Bye.}
{203}{mcs27}{What is it people got against mutants? We'll be on the lookout. Thanks. The town owes you. And I never forget things like this.}
{204}{}{O prazer é meu. Tchau.}
{205}{mcs28}{Keep your eye on him, will you? I want to catch him red-handed.}
{206}{}{Não há problema.}
{207}{mcs29}{Well, in that case, we'd better be sure to stop him. Want to come along?}
{208}{}{Com certeza.}
{209}{}{Não, obrigado.}
{210}{mcs30}{You want me to come along with you? Ah, what the hell, I'm too old to settle down. We goin' now?}
{211}{}{Sim.}
{212}{}{No, not right now.}
{213}{mcs31}{Ah, there's too much going on right now. When things calm down, then I just might.}
{214}{}{Sure. I got more questions.}
{215}{}{Adeus.}
{216}{mcs32}{Damn right. Best friend I ever had.}
{217}{}{Yeah, right, you would've dipped him just like everyone else.}
{218}{}{Adeus.}
{219}{mcs33}{Hell, yes, I would've. What a great mutant he would've been.}
{220}{}{I don't think he'd be happy to hear you say that.}
{221}{}{Adeus.}
{222}{mcs34}{(laughs) We had this argument all the time. (sighs) I miss that hard-head.}
{223}{}{What about the Master's hatred for humans?}
{224}{}{I still think it's a rotten fate.}
{225}{}{Adeus.}
{226}{mcs35}{You're talking a long time ago. The world's moved on. You want to hear ancient history?}
{227}{}{Definitivamente.}
{228}{}{Not right now. I'd like to ask some other questions, though.}
{229}{}{Not right now. I'll talk to you later.}
{230}{mcs36}{Right. Well, never really HATED humans. We just had a better way. These new governments, they think they've got all the answers. Blah, blah. Been there, seen that, got the scars.}
{231}{}{So what was the better way?}
{232}{mcs37}{The Master wanted to elevate everyone to his level, so we wouldn't fight each other anymore. He was convinced we wouldn't do it by ourselves -- couldn't. We had to be forced to evolve.}
{233}{}{Do you agree?}
{234}{mcs38}{While Jacob was alive, I thought the Master was wrong. But it seems that while some men can heed the call and rise above it all, most just run away.}
{235}{}{So you think the Master was right?}
{236}{mcs38a}{Jacob heard the call and embraced it. So did the Vault Dweller. But no matter how many rise above, the masses will always destroy them, right?}
{237}{}{Talvez.}
{238}{mcs39}{The Master just wanted everyone to see clearly. The Vault Dweller ended that dream.}
{239}{}{Sounds like you admired and hated the Vault Dweller at the same time.}
{240}{}{You were a human. How can you justify what the Master did to you?}
{241}{}{So you think the Master's plan was right?}
{242}{}{I'm descended from the original Vault Dweller, you know.}
{243}{mcs40}{You're right. If all humans fought for what they believed in like that, we wouldn't have needed the Master's plan in the first place.}
{244}{}{The Master wanted to enslave humanity!}
{245}{}{Interesting spin. I gotta go.}
{246}{mcs41}{Don't forget, I knew the folks involved. They were the best humanity had to offer. Your people are going to tell the story a different way, right?}
{247}{}{Err... Talvez. Umm, eu tenho mais perguntas.}
{248}{}{Wrong!}
{249}{mcs42}{The "original Vault Dweller"? You mean the one who killed the Master and destroyed the vats?}
{250}{}{Ummm... sim.}
{251}{}{Damn right. Gonna do something about it, mutie?}
{252}{}{Nããão... esta é outra pessoa. Eu não sei do que você está falando.}
{253}{mcs43}{Not a problem. Like I said, that was a long time ago.}
{254}{}{I'm not afraid of you.}
{255}{}{Why did you hate humans back then?}
{256}{mcs44}{No reason to be, unless you cross me or someone in my town. Be civilized, that's all I ask.}
{257}{}{I'll keep it in mind. I have more questions.}
{258}{}{I'll keep it in mind. Bye.}
{259}{mcs45}{Lemme make this clear: Nothing's going to happen here unless you start it. Just stay civilized while you're in my town.}
{260}{}{Yeah, right. I have more questions.}
{261}{}{Yeah, right. Bye.}
{262}{mcs46}{My memories of being a human aren't as clear as they once were, but I remember pettiness, hatred, jealousy... I prefer being a mutant.}
{263}{}{So you think the Master's plan was right?}
{264}{}{Huh. You're a lot uglier this way. Bye.}
{265}{}{Then you're fine. Bye.}
{266}{mcs47}{It was flawed. We should have only taken the best. Look around. Most mutants didn't have the mind or will to withstand the strain. (sighs) If only we had chosen better...}
{267}{}{So you would have dipped Jacob? Or the Vault Dweller?}
{268}{}{Yeah, that's a tragedy. Well, see ya later!}
{269}{mcs48}{You ever get back there, tell them the war's over. It's been over a long time.}
{270}{}{Ummm. Okay. I have more questions.}
{271}{}{Correto. Tchau.}
{272}{mcs49alt}{Thanks for your help. Could've been trouble. We took their weapons cache and disabled their bombs.}
{273}{}{Great! I have some questions...}
{274}{}{Hey, I found something out.}
{275}{}{Didn't learn anything.}
{276}{mcs103a}{Too many people. I've done my traveling with a horde.}
{277}{mcs103b}{I thought you were one of the good ones. I ain't coming with you.}
{278}{mcs103c}{I'm not coming with you right now. Sorry. [He looks you up and down distastefully.]}
{279}{}{All right. }
{280}{}{That scares the living crap outta me.}
{281}{}{Ain't much in the wasteland frightens me... that does.}
{282}{}{You must be as stupid as you look if you're gonna fight me.}
{283}{}{Chutando algumas bundas... de novo.}
{284}{}{It's almost too easy.}
{285}{}{Don't you have some friends who can help ya even this out?}
{286}{}{Had enough?}
{287}{}{Got it. Just so you know.}
{288}{}{Humph. Something wasn't right.}
{289}{mcs109}{You want me back now?}
{290}{}{Tudo bem.}
{291}{}{Not just yet. Goodbye.}
{292}{mcs110}{What do you want?}
{293}{}{How are you feeling?}
{294}{}{Heal yourself.}
{295}{}{Eu preciso que você espere aqui até eu voltar.}
{296}{}{É isso por agora.}
{297}{mcs111a}{I'm all set.}
{298}{mcs111b}{Got nothing that'll slow us down.}
{299}{mcs111c}{You got anything to help?}
{300}{mcs111d}{Maybe you should have a look at this.}
{301}{}{Use your skills to heal yourself.}
{302}{}{Não importa.}
{303}{}{OK}
{304}{mcs160}{I'll just stay here and tighten the vises on my shoulder.}
{305}{}{Não importa.}
{306}{}{OK}
{307}{}{North.}
{308}{}{Northwest.}
{309}{}{West.}
{310}{}{Southwest.}
{311}{}{Sul.}
{312}{}{Southeast.}
{313}{}{East.}
{314}{}{Northeast.}
{315}{}{Don't ask me. I don't know. }
{316}{}{É.}
{317}{}{Certo.}
{318}{}{Não.}
{319}{}{Why're you talking to me like this?}
{320}{}{Not very nice.}
{321}{}{Thanks. }
{322}{}{Isso ser bom.}
{323}{}{This ain't good.}
{324}{}{I like this. A lot. }
{325}{}{Tenho um mau pressentimento sobre isso.}
{326}{}{These people are nuts.}
{327}{}{Didn't learn anything.}
{328}{}{Learned something.}
{329}{}{Is anyone here sane?}
{330}{}{Gotta be another way.}
{331}{}{Siga-me.}
{332}{}{Tenta isso.}
{333}{}{Venha aqui.}
{334}{}{Found something you might want to see.}
{335}{}{Far as I can tell, it's safe to camp here.}
{336}{}{Ain't safe to camp here.}
{337}{}{Nós pode descansar aqui.}
{338}{}{Tive sorte.}
{339}{}{Fix this, would you?}
{340}{}{Turn this on.}
{341}{}{This thing needs to be unlocked.}
{342}{}{You gonna open this?}
{343}{}{Might want to come back here later.}
{344}{}{Não entendo.}
{345}{}{I dunno.}
{346}{}{Ow.}
{347}{}{Isso realmente dói.}
{348}{}{Isso não pode ser bom...}
{349}{}{Uh... when you said 'I hope she doesn't get pregnant' in the Cat's Paw in New Reno,
 what did you mean?}
{350}{mcs113}{Didn't your folks explain this to you?}
{351}{}{No, I mean, I thought all you mutants were sterile.}
{352}{}{Não importa.}
{353}{mcs114}{What? Where the hell did you hear that?}
{354}{}{So... you AREN'T sterile?}
{355}{}{Deixa pra lá.}
{356}{mcs116}{Nope. Well, not now. It takes a few years after bein' dipped to get the juices flowing again. Why?}
{357}{}{Oh. Uh. Never mind.}
{360}{}{You have exposed the conspiracy against the mutants of Broken Hills.}
{361}{}{Marcus agreed to join your party.}
{400}{}{About the missing people...}
{410}{}{About Jacob and Aileen...}
{420}{}{About Chad...}
{430}{}{About the escaped convicts...}
{440}{}{About a scientist from NCR...}
{500}{}{You've got a lot of nerve showing your face here again.}
{501}{}{Never mind. Could I ask you something?}
{502}{}{Deixa pra lá. Tchau.}
{600}{}{I don't feel so good, boss.}
{601}{}{Não faça isso.}
{602}{}{Don't you think this place is a little creepy?}
{603}{}{Hope you got hip waders... we're about to walk into some heavy shit.}
{604}{}{I don't much like the looks of this place.}
{605}{}{This broken bone can only grind so much before I pass out, boss.}
{606}{}{Ahh, humanity.}
{607}{}{Now this is a fine example of why the Master was right.}
{608}{}{And you thought mutants were diseased.}
{609}{}{Careful here, boss. These guys look tough.}
{610}{}{Man... you humans never cease to amaze me.}
{611}{}{Hope you know where we're going...}
{612}{}{Let's kick their asses, boss.}
{613}{}{It's assholes like these that make me mad.}
{614}{}{Ahh, home again.}
{615}{}{Don't forget... I helped build this place. Be good.}
{616}{}{Nice to see the ol' homestead again.}
{617}{}{I always hated this place.}
{618}{}{When do we leave?}
{619}{}{Let's get out of here.}
{620}{}{Don't think I'm wanted here, chief.}
{621}{}{So this is where it all started, eh?}
{622}{}{Let's have some healing over here, huh?}
{623}{}{Wanna play fetch, dog?}
{624}{}{Roll over, dog! Play dead!}
{625}{}{Hey dog! Sic 'em!}
{626}{}{Hey Lenny! You ever go to Broken Hills?}
{627}{}{Lenny! Let's get somethin' to drink!}
{628}{}{Nice to have another evolved human in the group, Lenny.}
{629}{}{Hey Myron! Wanna wrestle?}
{630}{}{Don't worry, little Myron. I'll watch out for you.}
{631}{}{Check out the big brain on Myron!}
{632}{}{Phwheew!!! Did someone just cut a muffin?}
{633}{}{[whistle] Daisy, daisy... [sing]}
{634}{}{Man, I've got one hell of a wedgie.}
{635}{}{At my age, it's nice to slow down every once in a while.}
{636}{}{Just watching the clouds...}
{637}{}{Zzzzzzzzz.}
{638}{}{Thanks, boss.}
{639}{}{Uh... thanks, friend.}
{640}{}{Err... thanks. I guess.}
{641}{}{Thanks. I was thirsty.}
{642}{}{Eita... Me sinto meio estranho.}
{643}{}{I guess Francis was right about Jacob. That murderous bastard won't cause any more trouble in this town.}
{644}{}{You have received a scoped hunting rifle.}
{1100}{mcs43alt}{Not a problem.}
{3000}{}{Let's head out.}
{3100}{}{Forget I asked then, asshole.}
{3200}{}{Never mind then. Your loss.}
{3300}{}{Darn. Maybe later then.}
{9999}{}{Eu gostaria de lhe fazer algumas perguntas...}
{10001}{}{Take some more stims and heal yourself.}
{10002}{}{Marcus, I need you to wait here until I come back.}
{10003}{}{Coloque sua arma de distância.}
{10004}{}{Ficar perto de mim.}
{10005}{}{Não fique muito longe.}
{10006}{}{Devemos espalhar um pouco.}
{10007}{}{Let's head out then.}
{10008}{}{Can you put your armor on?}
{10100}{}{C'mon, Marcus. Time to head out.}
{20000}{mcs81b}{Right.}
{20001}{}{Heh. I can use just about any big gun, like rocket launchers or miniguns,
 and the big energy weapons. I ain't bad with my fists, and I'm a hell of a shot with grenades. I don't
 wear armor. They just don't make it my size.}
{30000}{}{No thanks, I think I've spent enough time with him for today. Bye.}
{40000}{}{Guess I was right about Chad. Looks like he won't be running caravans anytime soon.}
{40001}{}{Alright Chad, time to pay for your crimes.}
{40002}{}{*sigh* I'm coming.}
{40003}{}{You have found Chad guilty of skimming money from the caravans.}
{40004}{}{You have found Chad guilty of skimming money from the caravans. Too bad he died.}
{193001}{}{Chad kept about $1000 from the last uranium shipment for himself. He's planning on bailing outta town. I got a briefcase of documents to prove it.}
{193002}{}{Chad kept about $1000 from the last uranium shipment for himself. He was planning on bailing out of town, but we had a confrontation. He's dead. I have a briefcase of documents to prove his involvement.}
{193003}{}{Chad's admitted to the whole thing. We got into a scuffle over at the caravan center. He's given up and waiting to be brought in.}
