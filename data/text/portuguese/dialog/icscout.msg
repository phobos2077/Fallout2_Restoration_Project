{100}{}{Você vê um tribal.}
{101}{}{Você vê a Sombra Ambulante.}
{150}{}{Você vê um tribal musculoso com cicatrizes pretas cobrindo seu rosto. Ele está te encarando silenciosamente.}
{151}{}{Você a Sombra Ambulante. Seu rosto está fortemente marcado com tatuagens rituais.}
{200}{}{Ele apenas te encara em silêncio.}
{201}{}{Ele te encara silenciosamente.}
{300}{}{Shhh... Estou caçando coelhos.}
{400}{}{[He looks upon you with untrusting eyes.] Who goes there?}
{401}{}{Meu nome é }
{402}{}{. Quem é você?}
{403}{}{I'm on a mission for Vault City. Who are you?}
{404}{}{My name is not important. I have come to warn you. You are in great danger!}
{405}{}{I am your nemesis. Prepare to join your ancestors!}
{406}{}{I'm French. Why do you think I have this outrageous accent? [Stare at him oddly.]}
{407}{}{Deixa pra lá. Desculpe incomodá-lo.}
{410}{}{You speak to Shadow Who Walks. Why have you come here?}
{411}{}{I'm trying to stop raider attacks on Vault City, and I have reason to believe that this is the raiders' base of operations. What do you know about the raiders?}
{412}{}{I was sent by Vault City on account of Raiders attacking them.}
{413}{}{I was just curious about this place, but I'll be leaving now.}
{414}{}{I'm doing some target practice, and you look like you would make an excellent moving target.}
{420}{}{Shadow Who Walks knows of no raiders here. Shadow Who Walks knows only of some Rangers here to free slaves from Vault City, that evil place. [He gives you a description which matches the one of the raiders.]}
{421}{}{Is that what they've told you, that they are Rangers? There are no Rangers around here, they are lying.}
{422}{}{Rangers? These aren't Rangers. Just look at their clothing. You're a pawn in their game. They are just using you.}
{423}{}{Look, I was sent by Vault City to find some Raiders. These men fit the description.}
{424}{}{Oh, alright. I guess I'll be leaving then.}
{425}{}{I don't believe you. Die, you wicked man!}
{430}{}{Why would they lie to Shadow Who Walks?}
{431}{}{Would you have helped them if they had told you that they were raiders, attacking innocent people, and that they didn't care one bit about helping anyone in Vault City?}
{432}{}{I don't know. It's a tough world out there. People prey on others all the time.}
{433}{}{To get a good laugh, perhaps? You look stupid enough to fall for anything.}
{440}{}{Shadow Who Walks would never help do that, that would be evil. [He eyes you suspiciously.] But why should Shadow Who Walks trust what you say?}
{441}{}{[Tell him of your home tribe.]}
{442}{}{Because I'm a Ranger, the real deal. [Show him your pin.]}
{443}{}{Because I know who these raiders are working for, and he's not a nice man at all. [Show him the data from the holodisk]}
{444}{}{I don't know. Sorry to waste your time.}
{445}{}{You don't have to, I'm gonna kill you anyway.}
{450}{}{[Shadow Who Walks seems to look upon you differently, with more trusting eyes.] Now Shadow Who Walks knows you are teller of truth. Shadow Who Walks trusts you.}
{451}{}{Well, what are you going to do now?}
{452}{}{Do you have any idea why these raiders might be attacking Vault City?}
{453}{}{That's funny, I've been lying to you all the time. How does that feel, moron?}
{460}{}{No, don't know. Only know they fooled Shadow Who Walks into helping them find the way.}
{461}{}{Well, what are you going to do now?}
{462}{}{You wouldn't happen to have heard them speak any names or anything like that?}
{463}{}{Well, never mind, I'll just kill all of them. I think I'm going to warm up a bit first by killing you...}
{470}{}{Hmmm... maybe. When some of them went to get more of the noisy, strange weapons... [He makes gestures like someone using a rifle of some kind]...they mentioned a name... Bishop. Yes, they talked about a man called Bishop.}
{471}{}{I see. Well, thank you, Shadow Who Walks, you have been most helpful.}
{472}{}{Good. Now that I have the information I wanted I'll just terminate this bunch of pests, starting with you...}
{480}{}{Shadow Who Walks thanks you, Shadow Who Walks does not like to be fooled.}
{481}{}{You are welcome. What now, then?}
{482}{}{Oh, really? And here I was, thinking you would be used to it by now, you being an idiot and all...}
{490}{}{Shadow Who Walks will not help anymore. Shadow Who walks will go home, and will not show evil men the way again.}
{491}{}{Good. This should prevent the evil men from harming innocent people in Vault City again.}
{500}{}{Shadow Who Walks thanks you, friend, for bringing the truth. May the spirits guide your path.}
{501}{}{And yours.}
{600}{}{[His face darkens.] That evil place. Why should Shadow Who Walks listen to one who comes from evil Vault City?}
{601}{}{Because a shadow will soon be all that's left of you if you don't.}
{602}{}{I didn't come hear to make you listen. I came here to make you dead.}
{610}{}{[He studies you warily for a moment.] Shadow Who Walks will listen. Now, why are you here?}
{611}{}{Vault City is under heavy attack, and the Vault City guards have been unable to find out who is really attacking and what their intentions are.}
{612}{}{Well, I don't really have a lot to say to you, so I'll just let my fists do the talking.}
{620}{}{And why should Shadow Who Walks think that is a bad thing? They are getting what they deserve, and Shadow Who Walks will be happy when they are defeated, and their 'servants' are freed.}
{621}{}{So, you support whoever is attacking them?}
{622}{}{Well, I don't think I'm going to let you live long enough for that to happen.}
{630}{}{Shadow Who Walks shows them the way to Vault City and back. Shadow Who Walks is very important to them, is needed for them to find the way.}
{631}{}{Well then, I'll just have to kill you, and the attacks should stop.}
{632}{}{You mean WAS important, right? What I'm trying to say is that you're going to die now, by my hand.}
{640}{}{[A look of fear slowly fills his face, and he starts backing away.] Please, no! Shadow Who Walks does not wish to die!}
{641}{}{Then leave this place, and these people, permanently. I'm going to count to ten, and if you're not gone by then, you'll be joining your ancestors in the skies above. ONE...}
{642}{}{Too late, my dear tribal. You are going to join your ancestors in about...12 seconds.}
{700}{}{(The tribal looks upon you with silence)}
{701}{}{[Keep staring]}
{702}{}{[Attack]}
{703}{}{Meu nome é }
{704}{}{. Quem é você?}
{705}{}{I'm on a mission for Vault City. Who are you?}
{706}{}{My name is not important. I have come to warn you. You are in great danger!}
{707}{}{Never mind, I'll just leave.}
{708}{}{I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!}
{710}{}{(The tribal continues to look upon you with silence)}
{711}{}{[Keep staring]}
{712}{}{[Attack]}
{713}{}{Meu nome é }
{714}{}{. Quem é você?}
{715}{}{I'm on a mission for Vault City. Who are you?}
{716}{}{My name is not important. I have come to warn you. You are in great danger!}
{717}{}{Never mind, I'll just leave.}
{718}{}{I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!}
{720}{}{(The tribal continues to look upon you with silence. It is clear he is becoming impatient.)}
{721}{}{[Keep staring]}
{722}{}{[Attack]}
{723}{}{Meu nome é }
{724}{}{. Quem é você?}
{725}{}{I'm on a mission for Vault City. Who are you?}
{726}{}{My name is not important. I have come to warn you. You are in great danger!}
{727}{}{Never mind, I'll just leave.}
{728}{}{I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!}
{800}{}{Shadow Who Walks believes you not. Shadow Who Walks is through talking. Goodbye.}
{801}{}{[FIM]}
{802}{}{Don't you turn your back on me tribal. I'm talking to you.}
{810}{}{How dare you threaten Shadow Who Walks. Leave now.}
{811}{}{[Walk Away]}
{812}{}{[Attack]}
{850}{}{Quem vem lá?}
{851}{}{Shhh... Estou caçando coelhos.}
{852}{}{HeeeeHeee! Hehe... He... You have nice paintings like a picture... Heeee!}
{900}{}{Shadow Who Walks does not understand. What do you mean?}
{901}{}{You are in great danger! Just tell me what you do here. I need to know whether I am speaking to the right person.}
{902}{}{Uh, bad spirits are coming for you.}
{903}{}{The danger is that I am here to kill you.}
{910}{}{Shadow Who Walks is a scout. Shadow Who Walks guides these Rangers through the mountains. Warriors can get lost if
 they know not the paths through the mountains.}
{911}{}{Then it is really you! My Elder sent me to tell you that something terrible will befall you.}
{912}{}{Is that what they've told you, that they are Rangers? There are no Rangers around here, they are lying.}
{913}{}{Rangers? These aren't Rangers. Just look at their clothing. You're a pawn in their game. They are just using you.}
{920}{}{What!? Shadow Who Walks does understand. Why would an Elder say such things?}
{921}{}{Listen to me! Our village Elder foresaw your death. The next time you leave this cave to guide these men through the
 mountains, you will not return alive. You must leave here immediately or the evil spirits will take you.}
{922}{}{Do you doubt the Elder?}
{930}{}{W-Why... Why should Shadow Who Walks believe you? How did the Elder foresee such events?}
{931}{}{Well... She was watching this movie once... No, no... Uh, she was playing this videogame... Mmmmm... Yes! It's called Fal-...}
{932}{}{She drank this drink, it smelled quite strong, and vivid dreams came to her.}
{933}{}{The bone in here nose told her. This is how she communicates with our ancestors.}
{940}{}{You are lying. This is not how one talks with the spirits. Now Shadow Who Walks will see how tongue of liar tastes with favorite brock sauce.}
{941}{}{[FEITO]}
{950}{}{Oh, then it is true what you speak. Shadow Who Walks knows the power of the spirits. What should Shadow Who Walks do?}
{951}{}{Well, I just spoke with them and they told me they don't like you very much. They asked me to kill you.}
{952}{}{You have to leave here forever and never guide these men again. The spirits are angry at you for leading these men
 through the mountains. Pray daily to the spirits and only then will their anger be lifted.}
{960}{}{Shadow Who Walks obeys. [Shadow Who Walks runs toward the ladder leading to the outside]}
{961}{}{You are welcome Shadow Who Runs.}
{1000}{}{You have broken the raiders' strength. They will no longer be able to raid the region.}
{1001}{}{Give it a day or two and I'm sure these Raiders will abandon this place. Then I can look around for information.}
