{100}{}{Você vê um negro bonito... er, não, espere. Você vê T-Ray.}
{150}{}{Você vê um negro musculoso com óculos grossos, barba rala e de atitude.}
{151}{}{Você vê T-Ray. Ele fica muito bem naqueles jeans.}
{152}{}{Você vê T-Ray. Ele ocasionalmente flexiona e sente seus bíceps, sussurrando "merda" para si mesmo.}
{153}{}{Você mal consegue distinguir o T-Ray além de toda essa atitude.}
{200}{}{Ei, não foi minha culpa que a camisinha que eu peguei tinha um buraco.}
{201}{}{Opa! Eu não estava me gabando pra todo mundo sobre nós fazendo isso. Eh Sério! Deve ser outra pessoa.}
{202}{}{PORRA, mulher. Depois que eu dar uma boa olhada, você sai e salva o mundo. Esse é o poder que T-Ray tem pra você.}
{210}{}{Estou dizendo para todos que nós somos INTIMOS. Que quando eu digo algo, é como se as ordens fossem suas.}
{211}{}{Você tem sorte que eu estava por perto para salvar sua pele, ou a Enclave teria feito CAFÉ DA MANHÃ de voce.}
{212}{}{Ae, heroína. Tenha certeza de dizer a todos que T-Ray é seu homem, fechou?}
{220}{}{Uau, estamos presenciando a realeza. Grande herói chegando.}
{221}{}{Sabe, você poderia ter dado uma passada aqui antes de sair e fazer tudo aquilo, então eu poderia ter te ajudado a dar uma surra no presidente.}
{222}{}{Eu também teria ido para a Enclave, só que eu estava em uma ligação muito importante.}
{230}{}{Quantos cavalos de potência tem essa coisa que você está carregando?}
{231}{}{Como você usa o banheiro com isso?}
{232}{}{Tem chance de você me dar essa armadura? Não vou te tirar, só quero emprestar um pouco.}
{250}{}{Se não é o homem, está aqui para me oprimir novamente.}
{251}{}{Sim, o Impala é um bom carro, mas nada como um Omni.}
{252}{}{Sempre que faço amor com você, é como lava fervendo...}
{253}{}{Droga, este carro precisa de uma corda de metal em volta da placa.}
{254}{}{O motor ainda está bom.}
{255}{}{O interior cheira como se alguém tivesse cagado dentro.}
{256}{}{O interior cheira como aqueles geckos idiotas.}
{257}{}{Que merda que um carro precisa para FUNCIONAR?}
{258}{}{O carro não vai te levar aonde você precisa ir, endendeu?}
{259}{}{Meu carro não é rápido, mas meu amor é.}
{260}{}{Eu não posso acreditar que minha bengala é tão longa.}
{261}{}{Ele me enforca como um brahmin de duas cabeças.}
{262}{}{O Highwayman tem um sistema analógico completo, 800 cavalos de potência, 0-100 em menos de um segundo.}
{263}{}{Rápido? O Highwayman vai de 0 a 100 em menos de um segundo.}
{264}{}{Na verdade, a potencia do Highwayman é de 800 CV.}
{265}{}{O Highwayman tem um sistema analógico completo e nenhum computador. Nada de extravagancias.}
{266}{}{O Highwayman é uma maquina; Chryslus sabia exatamente como construir.}
{267}{}{Eu dou uma chance a sua peça.}
{268}{}{Vou dar uma chance a sua peça.}
{275}{}{Quem é você? O que você está fazendo aqui?}
{276}{}{Droga. Veja o que acabou de entrar... parece que os exercicios superiores estão finalmente fazendo efeito. O que posso fazer por você, fofura?}
{277}{}{De novo aqui? O que você quer AGORA?}
{278}{}{Porra, mulher... você de novo? O que você quer agora? Eu não quero ouvir porra nenhuma sobre essa gravidez...}
{279}{}{}
{280}{}{ Ir aonde }
{281}{}{ vai}
{282}{}{Cai fora}
{283}{}{Onde você conseguiu esse Highwayman? Eu curto muito isso.}
{284}{}{Aquele carro que você tem na garagem me pertence.}
{285}{}{Você que roubou meu carro, babaca?}
{286}{}{Eu sou o tenente de Bishop, }
{287}{}{Sou um dos tenentes de Bishop. Estou aqui pelo carro dele.}
{288}{}{Vim buscar as baterias grátis do Sr. Bishop.}
{289}{}{Você pode fazer um upgrade no Highwayman?}
{290}{}{Posso comprar algumas baterias de você?}
{291}{}{Nada. Vou indo agora.}
{300}{}{Cara, isso NÃO é um banheiro, e você não pode entrar aqui. Agora saia.}
{301}{}{Garota, isso NÃO é banheiro, e você não pode entrar aqui. Agora saia.}
{302}{}{Você quer ENTRAR? Aqui? Bem... (Olha você de cima a baixo) ...um homem de verdade tem que fazer seu trabalho. Vamos aos negocios.}
{303}{}{hã-ham.}
{304}{}{hã-hã}
{306}{}{Vamos aos negocios.}
{307}{}{Não, obrigado. Eu mudei de ideia. Adeus.}
{320}{}{Tudo certo então...}
{321}{}{Uh-uh-uh}
{330}{}{Aw, so you just PLAYING with T-Ray? All right, then. Get, woman... I got better bitches to do with my time.}
{331}{}{Time keepz on ticking, ticking, ticking... inta the fuuuuture}
{333}{}{If suppose if you can catch dogs, you're welcome to do whatever you want with them. Good-bye.}
{334}{}{The fact you have sex with dogs does not surprise me. Good-bye.}
{340}{}{The Highwayman outside? Damn RIGHT you like the look of her. That's one sweet machine, a recent ac-quisition... we're just
 about to spruce her up, make some adjustments, then sell her off to ol' man Bishop.}
{341}{}{"Ajustes?" Que tipo de ajustes?}
{342}{}{Sell her to BISHOP? Look, idiot... Bishop's dea... er, I mean, I can meet Bishop's offer.}
{343}{}{Sell her to Bishop? Hell, I can meet Bishop's offer and then raise it some.}
{344}{}{Que coincidência. Eu sou o tenente de Bishop, }
{346}{}{Na verdade, você não vai vender aquele carro para ninguém. O carro é meu.}
{347}{}{Parece um bom negócio. Nos vemos mais tarde.}
{360}{}{Jazz up the engine, clean out the interior, put a brass rope around the license plate - and kick some of that shit
 outta the trunk, make some room. When we're done, it'll be worth some serious chips to Mr. Bishop.}
{361}{}{Sell her to Bishop? I can meet Bishop's offer and then raise it some.}
{362}{}{Que coincidência. Eu sou um dos tenentes de Bishop: }
{365}{}{Parece bom. Nos vemos mais tarde então.}
{375}{}{You're gonna match BISHOP'S offer? That's a lot of scrilla, man. A LOT of chips. Plus, he's one of the top men in
 Reno, y'know? I get him this machine, there's... FRINGE benefits.}
{376}{}{You're gonna match BISHOP'S offer? That's a lot of scrilla, woman. A LOT of chips. Plus, he's one of the top men in
 Reno, y'know? I get him this machine, there's... FRINGE benefits.}
{377}{}{Estou ouvindo...}
{378}{}{1000 tampas mudam sua opiniao?}
{379}{}{750 tampas mudam sua opiniao?}
{380}{}{500 tampas mudam sua opiniao?}
{381}{}{Na verdade, não tenho tampas suficientes para aceitar sua oferta agora...}
{382}{}{How about a night with me, T-Ray? You ain't never going to have anything better.}
{383}{}{My offer's this: I'll leave you in one piece if you give me MY car back right now.}
{384}{}{Não importa... eu tenho que ir.}
{395}{}{Man, that amount couldn't even afford to change my clothes, much less change my mind. }
{396}{}{Woman, that amount couldn't even afford to change my clothes, much less change my mind. }
{397}{}{Você deve pensar que os carros são baratos.}
{398}{}{Vamos renegociar então.}
{399}{}{Look, I can't make you an offer right now, but once I get the chips together...}
{401}{}{No, but your life is. I'll leave you in one piece if you give me back MY car right now.}
{402}{}{Não tenho tempo para isso agora. Adeus.}
{420}{}{Naw, I already got one dog I give a bone to, and I ain't looking to start a kennel. From the looks of you, you ain't
 got nothing that would be worth my time.}
{421}{}{Deixe-me ver seu estoque então.}
{422}{}{Know what? I'm SICK of listening to you and your bullshit. I'm going to carve you into so many pieces you could
 start your own butcher shop.}
{423}{}{Tudo bem então. Estou indo embora.}
{436}{}{Foda-se a negociação. Me devolva o meu carro, agora mesmo. Ou então.}
{437}{}{Esqueça. Vou te cortar em tantos pedaços que vou conseguir abrir o meu próprio açougue.}
{445}{}{(His eyes slide up and down your body.) I don't know if you're worth all THAT, woman. This is a HIGHWAYMAN we're talking about...}
{446}{}{Oh, I'm worth all that. And more.}
{455}{}{Curse me for a fool... it's a done deal, then. I get some playtime, then you can drive that Highwayman outta here.}
{456}{}{Então vamos a isso.}
{457}{}{Foda-se a negociação. Me devolva o meu carro, agora mesmo. Ou então.}
{458}{}{I've changed my mind. I think I'm just going to kill you instead.}
{459}{}{Esqueça. Estou indo.}
{470}{}{Look, why are you wasting my time? If you ain't got the chips, then you ain't got no business here. I got better
 things to do than be talking to your cheap ass.}
{471}{}{Only thing that's cheap in here is your life. I'll leave you in one piece if you give me back MY car right now.}
{472}{}{Sabe, essa foi sua última chance. Agora eu só vou te MATAR.}
{485}{}{SEU carro? }
{486}{}{Cara, você nem sabe do que está falando. }
{487}{}{Mulher, você nem sabe do que está falando. }
{488}{}{That Highwayman was scrap, left lying around, and guess what? Now it's ours. 'Course, you got an ISSUE with that, we
 could settle it here and now...}
{489}{}{Yeah, I got an issue with it. Let's go, chop shop boy...}
{490}{}{What are you doing with the car?}
{491}{}{No, that's cool. You can have the damn Highwayman. Piece of shit anyway. Uses too much 'tricity, smells like gecko inside,
 trunk's too small... be perfect for you, though. See ya.}
{492}{}{Não, eu não tenho nenhum problema com isso... ainda. Nos vemos por aí.}
{500}{}{Whoa, hold on there! *Piece of shit? Smells like Gecko?* }
{501}{}{Man, what kinda Jet you been taking? }
{502}{}{Woman, what kinda Jet you been taking? }
{503}{}{This is a HIGHWAYMAN. Not only does it run, but after I fix it up, it's gonna purr like a woman beneath me.}
{504}{}{I'm sick of listening to you. Eat lead, chop shop boy...}
{505}{}{What are you fixing on the car?}
{506}{}{Whatever. I'm outta here.}
{520}{}{Yeah, that's what I THOUGHT. You better run along now 'fore Momma gets worried about you.}
{521}{}{No, actually, it's YOUR Mom that gets worried without me around to please her.}
{522}{}{Let it go and leave quietly.}
{530}{}{All right, then. It's a done deal. (Scans the money quickly, pockets it.) The Highwayman's all yours. It ain't got no
 battery juice, of course, and it ain't got none of the special amen-ities I was gonna add...}
{531}{}{What amenities are you talking about?}
{532}{}{I am sick of this bullshit run-around. Eat lead, chop shop boy...}
{533}{}{Oh, but you've given me so MUCH already. I'm outta here.}
{540}{}{(T-Ray wipes the sweat off his body.) Goddamn, woman. All right then, the Highwayman's all yours. It ain't got none
 of the special amen-ities I was gonna add...}
{541}{}{*Huff-huff* What amenities are you...*huff-huff*...talking about?}
{542}{}{I am sick of this...*huff-*huff*...bullshit run-around. Eat...*wheeze*...lead, chop shop boy...}
{543}{}{I...*huff-huff*...got my car back, and I...*huff-huff*...don't want you touching it anymore. I'm... outta here.}
{550}{}{Sure can. I can jazz up the battery charger, spruce up the engine, clean out the interior a little, give it a shine, put
 a brass rope around the license plate - and  kick some of that shit outta the trunk, make some more room. 500 chips.}
{551}{}{You know, jazz up the battery charger, spruce up the engine, clean out the interior a little, give it a shine, put a brass
 rope around the license plate - and  kick some of that shit outta the trunk, make some more room. Any of that interest you?
 Only 500 chips.}
{552}{}{Sure. Here's 500 chips.}
{553}{}{How about 300 chips?}
{554}{}{I ain't got that much on me right now. How about I bring it back when I have the cash?}
{555}{}{How about some more sweet love?}
{556}{}{How about my body? That interest you?}
{558}{}{I'm SICK of this bullshit run-around. Eat lead, chop shop boy...}
{559}{}{I don't want you touching my car anymore. I'm outta here.}
{575}{}{Done. (Takes money) It's all taken care of. An' look: you ever need batteries, come talk to me, and I'll hook you up.}
{576}{}{Can I see what you have in stock now?}
{577}{}{All right, then, thanks. Catch you later, T-Ray.}
{590}{}{(Shakes his head.) Naw, that ain't gonna cut it. 500 or nothing.}
{615}{}{Course you can. It's all good. An' look: you ever need any batteries for it, come talk to me, and I'll hook you up.}
{616}{}{Actually, I need some batteries right now.}
{617}{}{I could use some batteries, but you know what? I don't feel like paying with chips... would you be interested in something... ELSE?}
{619}{}{All right, then. Catch you later.}
{630}{}{(Shrugs) Sorry, we ain't got no batteries now... come back in a week or two, maybe some will have turned up.
 'Course... we could just conduct bitness ANYWAY...}
{631}{}{Tudo certo.}
{632}{}{Sorry, only when it IS business. Later, T-Ray.}
{640}{}{Damn, bitch! I just gave you sweet love five minutes ago! You trying to KILL me?}
{641}{}{Agora, espera...}
{642}{}{C'mon, I need a charge, and only YOUR sweet love is going to do it.}
{643}{}{Nevermind then. Be that way.}
{650}{}{Naw, I already got one dog I give a bone to, and I ain't looking to start a kennel. From the looks of you, you ain't
 got nothing that would be worth my time. 500 chips is what sprucing up the Highwayman's gonna cost.}
{651}{}{All right then. Here's 500 chips.}
{653}{}{Know what? I'm SICK of listening to your bullshit. I'm going to put you down.}
{660}{}{(Stops you before you turn away.) Now hold on a minute, woman. I didn't say I didn't HAVE no sweet love for you.
 Let's get down to bitness.}
{661}{}{(Looks you up and down.) A man's gotta do who a man's gotta do. Let's get down to bitness.}
{662}{}{Get down to "bitness."}
{663}{}{No, I've changed my mind. Bye.}
{670}{}{Hey! The big hero comes 'round to T-Ray's neck o' the woods! Welcome, welcome... }
{671}{}{Hey, sweet-thing. You come back to relax with the Ray after you done kicking the world's ass? }
{672}{}{Say... I got something you might be interested in for yo car... IF you still have it.}
{673}{}{Wut izzit}
{675}{}{What have you got for the car?}
{690}{}{Damn, woman! I just gave you sweet love five minutes ago! You trying to KILL me?}
{691}{}{You wanna go AGAIN? Damn, woman! Don't your legs EVER close?}
{692}{}{Bem...}
{693}{}{C'mon, I need a-fixin', and only YOUR sweet love is going to do it.}
{710}{}{(Studies you, frowns) Yeah, sure you are. I know ALLA Bishop's lieutenants, and you ain't one of them.
 (Nods at the door.) Get outta here before I lose my temper.}
{711}{}{I AM one of Bishop's lieutenants. Now are we gonna deal, or what?}
{712}{}{I'm leaving, I'm leaving...}
{720}{}{(Sneers) Yeah, we're gonna deal all right. Better hope you ain't got no family who's gonna miss you...}
{721}{}{You better hope that you got a family that'll be able to find all your pieces.}
{730}{}{(Studies you.) You're one of Bishop's lew-tenants?! Naw... if you were, you'd be a little taller, a little
 more... (looks skeptical) ...bad-ass.}
{731}{}{(Studies you.) You're }
{732}{}{I'm legit. You challengin' me?}
{733}{}{Eu sou }
{734}{}{Don't believe everything you hear. Let's talk about Mr. Bishop's car.}
{735}{}{Forget this conversation. I'm outta here.}
{745}{}{(Raises his hands in mock surrender) Naw, naw, I was just playin' witcha.}
{746}{}{Let's talk about Mr. Bishop's car.}
{747}{}{Next time you better watch yourself. I'm outta here.}
{755}{}{Aiight, aiight... here's the deal: we can do all the upgrades, spruce her up, and get it to Mr. Bishop pronto.
 Price... (Shrugs, smiles) ...question is: how CAN you put a price on a Highwayman like this?}
{756}{}{Continue.}
{757}{}{I don't have TIME for your bullshit. What's the bottom-line?}
{758}{}{You're right. You can't. I will be taking the car with me, and Mr. Bishop will let you continue your operation here.}
{759}{}{I don't have time for this. I'm outta here.}
{770}{}{As I see it, this Highwayman... most likely the last of its kind in working order... is worth at LEAST 3000 chips... but
 y'know what? (Winks) I'm willing to part with this fine machine for 2700 chips considerin' the condition. A-course, we'd
 need ta talk about FRINGE benefits: club privileges, free admission to the ho-house...}
{771}{}{2700? Done. Here you are.}
{772}{}{Mr. Bishop is prepared to offer you 1500 chips.}
{773}{}{2700? No, no... Mr. Bishop will take it for 900 chips.}
{774}{}{I have a counter-offer. I will take the car for no charge, and Mr. Bishop will permit you to continue your operation here.}
{775}{}{I'll tell Mr. Bishop and return with his reply.}
{780}{}{(T-Ray blinks, then smiles slow and wide as you pass off the chips.) Now, I like a deal that's concluded fast and
 simple; pleasure doing bitness with you, pleasure doing bitness... now about those fringe benefits...?}
{781}{}{You will have to discuss those with Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bishop has one last request: free batteries from your shop.
 I will be the courier for these pick-ups.}
{782}{}{The other benefits you will have to discuss with Mr. Bishop himself. Be sure to go to talk to him armed and
 shouting loudly about what he owes you. He respects men like that.}
{783}{}{You will have to talk to Mr. Bishop about your fringe benefits. Goodbye.}
{790}{}{Man, that amount couldn't even afford to change my clothes! }
{791}{}{Woman, that amount couldn't even afford to change my clothes! }
{792}{}{What, does Bishop think cars are CHEAP?!}
{793}{}{Perhaps you feel you are being treated... unfairly?}
{794}{}{Mr. Bishop has made a GENEROUS offer of 1500 chips. You won't like the next offer.}
{795}{}{Then perhaps an offer of 900 chips will be more to your liking. Mr. Bishop will be pleased your work comes so cheaply.}
{797}{}{Since his generous offer has been refused, I'm instructed to take the car for no charge.}
{798}{}{I tire of this conversation. I will return later.}
{810}{}{Novecen... mano, você tá de brincadeira?! }
{811}{}{Novece... Muié, você tá de brincadeira?! }
{812}{}{Cut the bull-shit! This is a HIGHWAYMAN. They don't make them ANYWHERE anymore, see? There's OTHER families that'll be
 willin' to pay for it if that cheap bastard Bishop won't...}
{814}{}{Mr. Bishop has made a GENEROUS offer of 900 chips. You won't like the next offer.}
{816}{}{So you are dealing with other families? Mr. Bishop will be interested to hear that.}
{817}{}{I'm sorry? What did you just call Mr. Bishop?}
{818}{}{I tire of this. We'll talk again later.}
{830}{}{(T-Ray freezes. For a second, you think he's going to attack you, but then he relaxes.) Man, this is a raw deal. }
{831}{}{(T-Ray freezes. For a second, you think he's going to attack you, but then he relaxes.) Woman, this is a raw deal. }
{832}{}{What have I ever done to Bishop to deserve this? Huh?}
{834}{}{I'd take it up with Mr. Bishop. Oh... Mr. Bishop has one last request: he would like free batteries from your shop.
 I will be the courier for these pick-ups.}
{835}{}{I'm sure it was something. He doesn't like you much. Pleasure doing business with you.}
{845}{}{Naw, naw, nothin' like that...! Me and Mr. Bishop, we see eye to eye on this, no problems. He's treated me right, and you
 tell him that, aiight? But... uh... what 'bout those fringe benefits I mentioned...?}
{846}{}{You will have to discuss those with Mr. Bishop. Mr. Bishop has one last request: he would like free batteries from your
 shop. I will be the courier for these pick-ups.}
{847}{}{The other benefits you will have to discuss with Mr. Bishop. Be sure to go to talk to him armed and shouting loudly
 about what he owes you. He respects men like that.}
{855}{}{(T-Ray's smile fades.) Aiight... sure, sure... not a problem.}
{856}{}{Excellent. Give me all the batteries you have in stock right now.}
{857}{}{(Vai embora.)}
{865}{}{I will, I will... hey, you tell your boss he can buy batteries from me, too. I keep finding new ones every day round here.}
{866}{}{Really? Let me see what you have in stock.}
{875}{}{We ain't got any batteries right now; most of the cars we've stripped ain't turned up shit. Give us a week or two, aiight?}
{876}{}{All right. I'll let it slide. This time. See ya.}
{885}{}{(T-Ray's shoulders slump a little.) Aiight, aiight. Here you go. It's all I got.}
{886}{}{All right. I'll be back in two weeks for the next batch. Have them ready for Mr. Bishop.}
{896}{}{Okay. I'll try back later.}
{905}{}{Sure, we got some.}
{906}{}{Could I check out your stock?}
{907}{}{Well, I'd really like one, but I don't want to pay for it. Is there something... ELSE I could do to pay for it?}
{909}{}{Just checking. Be seeing you.}
{915}{}{Grav-plates! These beauties'll let you FLY cross the wasteland, and they have a recycling power chip, so they
 barely suck up any juice. How do you like that? You want 'em?}
{916}{}{Me like me take}
{918}{}{Sounds good. I'll take it.}
{919}{}{Not right now. I have come to collect Mr. Bishop's free batteries.}
{920}{}{Not right now. Can you upgrade the Highwayman without adding the grav plates?}
{921}{}{Not right now. Can I buy some batteries from you instead?}
{922}{}{No, not at the moment. Maybe later. See ya.}
{930}{}{(T-Ray spends an hour or two in the shop. When he emerges, the grav-plates have been installed.)}
{931}{}{Thanks, T-Ray. Appreciate it. I'll go try them out.}
{940}{}{Help yourself, hero.}
{941}{}{What's mine is yours. Tell everybody I said that, too.}
{942}{}{Damn. You save the world, and you STILL got to go through everybody's shit.}
{950}{}{Get away from my shit.}
{951}{}{Next time you touch my shit, you're going to get yo ass beat.}
{1000}{}{You got the car back without using violence.}
{1001}{}{You successfully tricked T-Ray.}
{1002}{}{You have received a free supply of car batteries.}
{1100}{}{Too... much... sex... gonna... blow...}
{2000}{}{You got a battery for the Highwayman.}
{2010}{}{You got the upgrade for the Highwayman.}
{5286}{}{. I'm here for the car.}
{5731}{}{?! I heard }
{5733}{}{. You challengin' me?}
{6731}{}{ was a little taller, a little more... (looks skeptical) ...bad-ass.}
