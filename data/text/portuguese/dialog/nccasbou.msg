{350}{}{You got some serious balls to have taken out the Enclave like that.}
{351}{}{I figger that taking out the Enclave like you did took more balls than everyone in New Reno combined.}
{352}{}{Busting the Enclave makes you almost as much a badass as Tommy the Balls.}
{353}{}{I'm not s'posed ta chat while on duty, but I'm glad you kicked the Enclave's ass.}
{354}{}{Yer all right, tribal. Take a rest from saving the world and have some fun.}
