{100}{}{You see a fisherman.}
{101}{}{You see a fisherwoman.}
{102}{}{He is carrying a sharpened pole used for fishing.}
{103}{}{Ela parece ocupada cozinhando.}
{104}{}{Cumprimentos.}
{200}{}{Você não é bem vindo aqui.}
{201}{}{Os espíritos não gostam de você.}
{202}{}{Vá embora, estranho.}
{203}{}{Por que nos afligem?}
{204}{}{Bem vindo, amigo.}
{205}{}{Você sempre será bem-vindo aqui.}
{206}{}{Os espíritos aceitam você como um de nós.}
{207}{}{Obrigado por nos ajudar.}
{208}{}{Eu pensei que todos estranhos eram maus. Não é tão...}
{209}{}{Não faça isso.}
{300}{}{Excuse me, but could you do me a small favor? I'm a little busy here and I don't know if I can leave this pot unattended.}
{301}{}{Com certeza. O que você precisa?}
{302}{}{I'm busy too. Perhaps a little later.}
{303}{}{Hey, life is full of problems and I'm not here to solve them all. Bye.}
{304}{}{I'm running low on wood for this fire. If you could collect some more for me, I'd really appreciate it. I'd do it myself, but I am afraid this pot will boil over if I leave it unattended. I'm sure some logs can be found in the nearby forest. Three bundles would be perfect.}
{305}{}{Seria um prazer.}
{306}{}{Actually, for some crazy reason, I happen to have three bundles of logs on me right now. Here you go.}
{307}{}{You'll help me? Great! Let me know when you've collected them.}
{308}{}{Ah, excellent. This will help keep this fire going. Thank you for taking the time to help me. I don't really
 have anything to repay with though.}
{309}{}{Your gratitude is enough. Take care.}
{310}{}{Nothing to repay me? Look lady, I could have died in those woods. It's filled with all kinds of deadly creatures. I risked my neck for this fucking wood. Not to mention I think one of the logs gave me a splinter. I *hate* splinters.}
{311}{}{Well, here, take this money. I have no real use for it here. Thank you again.}
{312}{}{That's better. Bye.}
{313}{}{[FEITO]}
{314}{}{Hmmf. Go bother someone else.}
{315}{}{Did you bring the firewood?}
{316}{}{Yeah, I got it right here.}
{317}{}{No, not yet. I'll be back when I get the three bundles.}
{318}{}{Are you ready to help me?}
{319}{}{Com certeza. O que você precisa?}
{320}{}{No, I still need more time. Bye.}
{321}{}{No, and I won't be. Deal with your own problems. Bye.}
{330}{}{No real use for it? Then why didn't you give it to me in the first place? (mumble) Stupid bitch.}
{400}{}{Whut you need?}
{401}{}{Ooo! Make me favorite food!}
{410}{}{I look.}
{411}{}{I have wood. Heh-heh... wood.}
{420}{}{That ok. Bye!}
{500}{}{Vile slaver!}
