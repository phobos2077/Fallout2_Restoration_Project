{150}{}{You see a grease-covered mechanic.}
{151}{}{You see one of the chop shop boyz.}
{152}{}{You see a shifty-looking mechanic. You can barely make out his features beneath the grease and oil.}
{200}{}{Holy shit. *Gulp* Look what just walked in.}
{201}{}{Well, if ain't Mr. Fucking Coffee Can.}
{202}{}{Anybody in that thing?}
{203}{}{Can we get you anything? A beer? Some water? A danish?}
{204}{}{I hope nothing's wrong, uh, sir... or ma'am. Whatever you are inside there.}
{205}{}{Whatever's wrong, T-Ray's responsible. I'd see him.}
{206}{}{Is that some kind of new car?}
{207}{}{We don't want any trouble.}
{208}{}{Maybe you came looking for T-Ray. He's in the back.}
{220}{}{Well, helloooo there, little lady. Damn fine performance you give.}
{221}{}{Wow. Don't get many visitors. What can we do for you, Miss }
{222}{}{How did you get your legs over your head like that?}
{223}{}{Are those real tits? Can I make sure?}
{224}{}{Would it be too much trouble for you to check under my hood?}
{225}{}{Aw, hell, I look like crap, then you show up. Don't mind the grease, miss.}
{226}{}{You looking for talent? T-Ray's in the back, so don't bother going there.}
{227}{}{I knew I should have washed today...}
{228}{}{Check your oil? Heh-heh.}
{229}{}{Wanna see my lil' grease monkey?}
{230}{}{::Assobios::}
{231}{}{Droga. Todas essas curvas e eu sem freio nenhum.}
{232}{}{Well, helloooo there, little lady.}
{233}{}{Wow. Don't get many visitors. What can we do for you, miss?}
{234}{}{You looking for some hot love? T-Ray's in the back, so don't bother going there.}
{245}{}{Vi você lutando no ringue. Que belo gancho que você deu.}
{246}{}{Você vai cair? Eu ganhei 30 conto apostando em você.}
{247}{}{You don't look so tough for a prizefighter.}
{248}{}{Quanto você pesa?}
{249}{}{Onde você trabalha fora do ringue?}
{250}{}{Cuidado com o Masticator. Ele é louco por orelhas.}
{251}{}{Wanna beer? We usually save them for when we're working.}
{252}{}{T-Ray said you ain't so tough. I'll give you 5 chips if you go punch him.}
{253}{}{T-Ray said you got a glass jaw. He's in the back if you want to go talk to him.}
{254}{}{That Mastictor's a big wuss. Uh, don't tell him I said that, though.}
{265}{}{I hope nothing's wrong, ma'am.}
{266}{}{We meant no disrespect, ma'am.}
{267}{}{Holy shit. *Gulp* Look what just walked in.}
{268}{}{What can we do for you, }
{269}{}{Can we get you anything? A beer? Some water? A danish?}
{270}{}{Whatever's wrong, T-Ray's responsible. I'd see him.}
{271}{}{Tell your boss hello from all us.}
{272}{}{Maybe you came looking for T-Ray. He's in the back.}
{273}{}{I hope nothing's wrong, sir.}
{274}{}{We meant no disrespect, sir.}
{300}{}{Sorry about that misunderstanding with the Highwayman.}
{301}{}{We didn't know the Highwayman was yours.}
{302}{}{Yeah, the Highwayman's not a bad car, but I'd rather have an Omni.}
{303}{}{You looking to sell the Highwayman?}
{304}{}{Go, greased lightning, go.}
{305}{}{Grease is the word that I heard... dum dum dum dum...}
{306}{}{The Highwayman's a sweet car; Chryslus sure knew how to make them back then.}
{307}{}{T-Ray's "working" in the back again. Lazy bastard.}
{308}{}{I'm sick of picking up T-Ray's slack.}
{309}{}{T-Ray's been scoping my woman again.}
{310}{}{T-Ray slept with my sister. And my mother. And my dog.}
{311}{}{T-Ray's hornier than a four-headed goat.}
{312}{}{T-Ray's in the back. On the phone.}
{313}{}{Engine's still good.}
{314}{}{Interior smells like someone took a dump in there.}
{315}{}{Interior smells like gecko.}
{316}{}{Not a bad car, but I'd rather have an Omni.}
{317}{}{The Highwayman's got a full analog system, 800 + Horsepower, 0 to 60 in less than a second.}
{318}{}{Fast? The Highwayman goes from 0 to 60 in less than a second.}
{319}{}{The Highwayman's got the power: 800+, in fact.}
{320}{}{You supposed to be here?}
{321}{}{Feel sorry for the idiot who left this Highwayman lying around.}
{322}{}{I wouldn't sweat it; the Highwayman's got a full analog system and no computers. None of the fancy stuff.}
{330}{}{Hands off or your hands come off. Understand?}
{331}{}{Get the HELL away from that car.}
{332}{}{Your life ain't worth more than that car. Touch it again, and I'll prove it to you.}
{5221}{}{?}
{5268}{}{?}
