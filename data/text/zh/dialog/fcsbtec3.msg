{100}{}{You see a person in funny pajamas. He seems preoccupied.}
{101}{}{You see a Shi submarine technician.}
{150}{}{Uh, what are you doing, sneaking around like that?}
{151}{}{Are you some kind of spy?}
{200}{}{This is filthy, look at all that rust!}
{201}{}{I can't fathom why we need to keep this running.}
{202}{}{Those torpedoes are an accident waiting to happen.}
{300}{}{I don't recall ever seeing you around here, what are you doing in the torpedo room? And who are you anyway?}
{301}{}{You again? What are you still doing in the torpedo room? And who are you anyway?}
{302}{}{I'm a last-minute addition to your tech team. Sorry for not informing you earlier. Oh, and I'm here to do some
 maintenance on the torpedoes. They look horrible, an accident waiting to happen!}
{303}{}{I was added to your roster just recently. I was asked to work with the targeting systems of the torpedoes,
 since they've been acting up recently. I think it might be due to certain uncorrectable flaws in the design of the
 Sungsam motherboards.}
{304}{}{I'm a repairman, freshly added to your roster. I'm supposed to be doing periodic maintenance on the torpedoes,
 since they look like hell! Look at all that rust! And the propellers look like they're about to fall off!}
{305}{}{Sorry, wrong room.}
{310}{}{Oh, good to finally have a qualified mechanic on board. I've been meaning to fix these, but I just can't get over
 my fear of those torps. Did you know that they carry enough explosives to turn this entire vessel into finely ground scrap?}
{311}{}{I'll exercise caution, I promise.}
{320}{}{They finally sent me a mechanic, after all those weeks of begging...}
{330}{}{Uh, you don't look like a mechanic. Frankly, I don't think you can tell a spanner from a screwdriver from the
 looks of it, so why don't you go back and help the rest of the guys, instead of loitering in the torpedo room? I don't
 want you to blow us up accidentally.}
{331}{}{Fine, I'll go.}
{340}{}{That's all fine and good, but, uh, why are you looking for the console in the torpedo room? It's in the room behind
 you. I need a mechanic, not another technician, so unless you are also a talented repairman, I need you to leave.}
{341}{}{Actually, yes, I'm also a repairman, with quite a bit of experience in dealing with ancient technology. I believe
 I can handle those torpedoes. I'll get the propellers working properly and make sure they don't turn us into finely ground
 scrap.}
{342}{}{Fine, I'll go.}
{350}{}{Oh, specialists in both fields are not common in the wastelands. I guess I can trust you, so go ahead and fix those
 torpedoes so that I can finally feel a little safer.}
{351}{}{Alright.}
{360}{}{Hey, I'm busy here.}
{361}{}{Sorry, I'm working.}
{370}{}{Don't touch that!}
{371}{}{What did I tell you?!}
{372}{}{I warned you!}
{375}{}{What the hell are you doing! Guards!}
{380}{}{Stop wasting time and get to work.}
