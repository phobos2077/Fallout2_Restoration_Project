{100}{}{You see torpedos.}
{101}{}{These dangerous-looking weapons are filled to the brim with explosives. The casings are corroded and it
 seems the propellers will fall off any second now.}
{200}{}{Despite the looks, this torpedo is still a potent weapon. The loose propeller is actually an integral part of
 its navigating system, giving it unprecedented maneuverability. Looks like you need to break out the tools to disable it.}
{210}{}{Thanks to two centuries of decay, the rusted propulsion system is easy to disassemble. Moments later, it's put
 back together, this time completely immobilized.}
{211}{}{The rusted-through propulsion system is too much of a challenge. The nuts are stuck and you can't quite figure
 out how to detach the propeller without cutting yourself.}
{220}{}{You have planted explosives near several high-explosive torpedoes. It might be a good idea to get the hell
 out of here.}
