{100}{}{You see a lost spirit.}
{101}{}{You see Nessa, the lost spirit.}
{102}{}{You see the spirit of a pretty young girl, illuminated by the cold glow of the moon.}
{103}{}{I'm betrayed. Betrayed and alone.}
{104}{}{How could he do this to me?}
{105}{}{The blood... So much blood...}
{110}{}{He said that he loved me. That we could start over together. How could he do this?}
{111}{}{Who did this to you? Can you hear me?}
{120}{}{It's all a lie. He doesn't love me at all. Oh, he's got a knife! It hurts! The look in his eyes, so cold, so...}
{121}{}{If you can hear me, tell me who's hurting you. Who did this?}
{122}{}{That's it--that's enough for me. I'm outta here.}
{130}{}{He's walking away now. He's leaving me here to die alone. How could this happen?}
{131}{}{Please, just give me a name. Give me something more to work with.}
{140}{}{It wasn't supposed to be like this. You said you wanted to start a family with me. Oh, it's so cold... I think I'm dying... No! This isn't real! You would never do this to me, Thorg! I love you! Nessa will always love you...}
{141}{}{Thank you, Nessa. That's all I needed to hear.}
{150}{}{It's so lonely in the dark... So very lonely.}
{151}{}{[Done]}
{160}{}{The blood, it never stops flowing... why won't this pain end?}
{161}{}{Don't worry, Nessa, I'm going to help you find peace soon.}
