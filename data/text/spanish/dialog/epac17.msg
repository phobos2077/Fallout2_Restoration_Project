{100}{}{That's it... I think.}
{101}{}{No, but it can't... I, well... hmmm...}
{102}{}{The blue wire to the red housing...}
{103}{}{Those mutations are progressing nicely.}
{104}{}{It won't be long now.}
{105}{}{Just a few more drops of HCl...}
{106}{}{You see a man in a white lab coat.}
{107}{}{You see The Doctor.}
{108}{}{The leading - and only - Doctor left in the EPA.}
{109}{}{It would be unwise to attack me.}
{120}{}{¿Sí?}
{121}{}{Hola, mi nombre es }
{122}{}{. ¿Quién eres?}
{123}{}{Perdona que te haya molestado. Adiós.}
{130}{}{I'm known as the Doctor.}
{131}{}{Oh, right. So what do you do? Why are you here all on your own? The rest of the place looks deserted.}
{132}{}{De acuerdo, gracias.}
{140}{}{I see you are adequately skilled in the ways of science. Maybe you could understand what I do here after all. What do you wish to know?}
{141}{}{¿Por qué estás aquí?}
{142}{}{¿Qué haces aquí?}
{150}{}{I'm sorry, but I don't believe you have the skills required to understand what I'm doing here. Come back when you're mentally tougher.}
{151}{}{Whoa, just a minute. I'll have a go at anything you give me!}
{152}{}{De acuerdo entonces. Adiós.}
{160}{}{I was part of the original team of scientists that worked here in the EPA before the war. Unfortunately, none of them were skilled enough in the scientific disciplines or possessed sufficient resolve and had to leave. Now, I'm the only one left.}
{161}{}{So, are you happy with that? I mean, being the only one here?}
{170}{}{Anything I want to really. At the moment, I'm carrying out more genetic research on creatures that I've created in order to observe the effects of FEV on their immune systems. Years ago, I created many new drugs and adapted several others, but I don't do that anymore.}
{171}{}{What's that about creatures you've created?}
{172}{}{What types of drugs have you made?}
{180}{}{No, you cannot. You just aren't skilled enough in the ways of science and biological enhancements. Now, if you'll excuse me, you're wasting my time.}
{181}{}{I most certainly am not. Try me.}
{190}{}{<smiles> Well, maybe so. OK, if you wish, I'll give you a chance. What would you like to know then?}
{191}{}{¿Por qué estás aquí?}
{192}{}{¿Qué haces aquí?}
{200}{}{Why of course! Nobody to watch over me. No rules whatsoever. I do whatever I want, whenever I want. Also, with only me being left here, I have access to all the equipment I would ever need. Anything else?}
{201}{}{Who are the people over there in those cages?}
{202}{}{What's all the funny colored liquid I've seen around the EPA?}
{203}{}{Where do you get all of the equipment from?}
{210}{}{Those in the first cells over by that wall are some villagers that wandered in here by mistake and I captured them for use later on. The other stronger-looking ones are my own warriors for... emergencies.}
{211}{}{...for use later? What do you mean?}
{212}{}{Gracias. ¿Puedo preguntarte otra cosa?}
{213}{}{Right. Thanks. I must be going now.}
{220}{}{Chemicals and tanks of FEV mostly. It was all contained in great barrels for safe storage here at the EPA. Unfortunately, there was a minor accident and a huge chemical leak forced everyone except those daft holograms to leave. Some of the chemicals have leaked into the lower levels. I'm now using it as experimentation material. So far, it's provided some promising results!}
{221}{}{What types of results? Do you mean you've created these creatures?}
{222}{}{So where do you get all your equipment from?}
{230}{}{Here mostly. The EPA was originally designed and furnished with all kinds of machinery and, since all the other scientists left, none of it was ever used. I'm just running out of a few things now after so many years...}
{231}{}{No importa. Debo irme ahora.}
{240}{}{Drugs? Dozens! Over the years I've created mentats, buffout, stimpaks, medical kits of varying strengths, psychos and many others that you wouldn't understand. I don't do that anymore, though. I created the Mr. Chemmie! robot to do that for me. It's in the main complex. If you have the intelligence and scientific skills you say you have, then feel free to use it to make any drugs you want.}
{241}{}{¿Qué clase de drogas especiales has creado?}
{242}{}{Where can I find Mr. Chemmie!?}
{243}{}{Gracias. Decirme, ¿alguna vez has oído hablar de jet?}
{250}{}{Yes, I've created many creatures whilst I've been at the EPA. If you're an exploring type, then you may have come across some of them in the wastes. Centaurs?  Floaters? The "Aliens"? They roam freely now in the wastes. I've just retained a few here and in the main base for future reference.}
{251}{}{Just a minute. Are you telling me that all those creatures out there, those things that are plaguing the wasteland and killing innocents were created by you?!}
{252}{}{Whoa, nota a sí mismo: no ira al Doctor. Adiós.}
{260}{}{'What do I mean?' The Forced Evolution Virus, of course! I'm only just beginning to experiment as to the effects on humans. We've all heard the story of the Master. I was thinking of doing something similar myself. An army of my own would certainly be very useful!}
{261}{}{Don't you think that's a bit immoral? How can you even consider such a hideous thing?}
{262}{}{Just getting around to humans? What else have you worked on then?}
{263}{}{Bien, buena suerte con eso. Debo irme ahora.}
{270}{}{Yes, I suppose you can. You amuse me greatly. What else can I answer for you? }
{271}{}{Háblame de nuevo sobre este gente.}
{272}{}{What's all the funny-colored liquid around the EPA?}
{273}{}{Where do you get all the equipment and supplies for your experiments?}
{280}{}{No, no, no. Before you leave, I must ask you something. Could you do a little favor for me? I don't leave the safety of the warehouse for fear of things being stolen. I need some raw materials. Could you help me?}
{281}{}{Yeah, I suppose so. What do you need?}
{282}{}{No, I'm too busy at the moment. Maybe some other time.}
{290}{}{Yeah, I wondered what the virus would do on regular domesticated animals saved in storage from before the war. The unfortunate thing was it affected their reproductive cycles and they bred very quickly. I released them into the wastes soon after I realized that.}
{291}{}{You're a monster! No wonder nobody in the area knows about you! You ought to be disposed of.}
{292}{}{Well, I don't agree with what you are doing, but there's nothing I can do about it. Goodbye.}
{300}{}{Special drugs? Well, I've been cultivating a new crop of marijuana. It's a pre-war drug that I found in deep freeze. I only have manure though from the mutated creatures you see here, so it was more dangerous than I first thought. The first trials weren't very successful, anyway...}
{301}{}{Can I get some of this drug?}
{302}{}{Why weren't they successful? What happened?}
{310}{}{Mr. Chemmie! is located in the northeast section of the bottom floor of the EPA. Or maybe the northwest... Actually, it's on the top floor. Oh, I can't remember anymore. It's a huge chunk of machinery. You can't miss it.}
{311}{}{Right. Thanks. You mentioned you'd created some special drugs. Like what?}
{320}{}{Easily. I'm a scientist. That's what I do. Experiments are my life. Though different, it really is just another type of experiment.}
{321}{}{You're messing with things that you shouldn't be altering! What if things go wrong? What if some of the people you're working on die!?}
{330}{}{Disposed of! Oh, no. I don't think so. I'm doing the job I was originally hired to do. Investigate and experiment. As time goes on though, you start to run out of things to investigate, so you have to be more liberal in your ideas. I think it was once called 'thinking outside the box'.}
{331}{}{I've had enough of this! If no one else will stop you, then I will.}
{332}{}{You're sick and I'm leaving. Goodbye.}
{340}{}{Yeah, why not? Help yourself. There's plenty in the storage sheds on the surface level. I think I may have programmed Mr. Chemmie! to make it as well. I don't keep any around here anymore as it takes up a lot of space.}
{341}{}{Thanks! You were saying a moment ago that you weren't successful in early trials? Why is that?}
{350}{}{Well, some of the test subjects had severe reactions to the virus, but those are not even worth mentioning. A few errors here and there are expected in our line of work. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have things to do.}
{351}{}{Yeah, I suppose I do as well. Goodbye.}
{360}{}{Then they die. What do you expect me to do? This is how one makes progress.}
{361}{}{Monstrous! Unbelievable! You die - now!}
{362}{}{I can't stand this anymore. Goodbye. I won't be back soon.}
{370}{}{Jet? Yeah, that's the drug that most of Redding's been high on, if I'm not mistaken. It's an exceptionally complex compound and my machines couldn't reproduce it even on maximum power. Why? What do you know of it?}
{371}{}{Well, I have here with me it's creator.}
{380}{}{[*Eyes sparkle*] Really!? Who? Can I see him? Maybe speak to him?}
{381}{}{Of course. His name is Myron. He's right here.}
{390}{}{Thank you for bringing that Myron kid to me. He's very knowledgeable! Not quite as intellectually adept as me, understand, but well nonetheless. If he ever wants to settle down he can come here as my apprentice.}
{391}{}{I'm not sure he'd like being anybody's apprentice. We'd better be going.}
{400}{}{One moment, before you go. Please, take this as a token for bringing Myron here. I have no real use for it.}
{401}{}{Hey, thanks. Um, what is it?}
{410}{}{It's a Solar Scorcher. It was an experiment of mine. It feeds off the energy from the sun and thus no ammunition is required. It actually works and will be of great use to you, I'm sure, in the deep wastes. This requires a further question actually...}
{411}{}{¿Qué tienes para hacer?}
{420}{}{You seem an adventurous type. I'm restricted to the grounds of the EPA to watch over many of the experiments, but I need some equipment that I've run out of. Could you collect a few things for me?}
{421}{}{Yeah, I suppose so. What do you need?}
{422}{}{No, I'm too busy at the moment saving my village. Maybe some other time.}
{430}{}{Well, one of the only animals I haven't looked into in detail is the Golden Gecko. I need some research material before I can go any further. Could you collect, say, 10 golden gecko pelts and bring them back here to me? I'm sure I could find something here to give you.}
{431}{}{No problem. I'll be back as soon as I have them.}
{432}{}{I already have 10 pelts with me.}
{440}{}{[Looks up at you.] What?}
{441}{}{Uh, hello again. I didn't catch who you are the last time we spoke.}
{450}{}{You again? What do you want now?}
{451}{}{What do you do here? This place is like a ghost town.}
{460}{}{If you do not wish to help me, then please leave me alone. Or, have you decided to lend your abilities?}
{461}{}{Yes. What do you want me to do?}
{462}{}{No, but as soon as I'm free I'll be back to help you.}
{470}{}{Hello there. Have you calmed down at all yet?}
{471}{}{No, I'm here to kill you. The world needs less people like you.}
{472}{}{Sí, supongo. Necesito hacerte unas preguntas.}
{480}{}{What do you want? I have experiments to watch over, you know!}
{481}{}{Tell me about the drugs you're making.}
{482}{}{Háblame de esa gente de nuevo.}
{483}{}{Estoy buscando trabajo. ¿Tienes alguno?}
{484}{}{Where do you get all your equipment from?}
{490}{}{Have you collected the pelts as I requested?}
{491}{}{Si, aquí están.}
{492}{}{No, aún no.}
{500}{}{Wonderful! Excellent! Let me see... ahh yes, these will do nicely! Now then, do you want another job?}
{501}{}{Sí, si tienes alguna otra cosa.}
{502}{}{Aún no, gracias. Adiós.}
{510}{}{Well, although the warehouse is where I do almost all of my work, I still need to enter the main complex from time to time. However, the lights have been permanently fixed on low setting. Sort this out for me so I can enter the EPA building itself.}
{511}{}{No hay problema.}
{512}{}{I'll get back to you when I have time to do it.}
{513}{}{I've already done this! There were some loose wires on the main circuit board and I mana-}
{520}{}{Now that you've killed all of my warriors, you have more than proven yourself worthy. Would you consider working for me?}
{521}{}{What!? Working for you!? What would you want me to do?}
{522}{}{No, gracias. Adiós.}
{530}{}{Have you sorted out the power problem yet?}
{531}{}{Yes, yes, yes, I don't need to know the specifics. Thanks. Now, I still have one more task if you wish to undertake it.}
{532}{}{¿Qué tienes para hacer?}
{533}{}{No, sigo trabajando en ello.}
{540}{}{I am experimenting with a new serum at the moment to improve the agility and awareness of people to help them survive in this harsh world. You'd allow me to try it on you, wouldn't you?}
{541}{}{Well... I suppose so, what harm could it do?}
{550}{}{More than you'd ever believe if it goes wrong... Now hold still and let's get down to it!}
{551}{}{¡Eh, eh! Espere un minuto...}
{560}{}{Ahh, there you are! Back in the land of the living, I see! How do you feel?}
{561}{}{Uh, ¿bien por qué?}
{570}{}{You just blacked out for a couple of hours, but you should be fine now. Indications show you are much more alert and responsive.}
{571}{}{¡Caray! Gracias, doctor.}
{580}{}{No problem. If you ever need anything, let me know.}
{581}{}{Eso haré. Adiós.}
{590}{}{Have you decided to help me yet?}
{591}{}{Yes, I will help you. I'll return when the power is restored.}
{592}{}{No, lo siento.}
{600}{}{I'm sorry, but there's nothing more I can do for you now. I have no more jobs left to be done. Thanks for your help.}
{601}{}{Entonces adiós.}
{602}{}{Yes, there were some loose wires and I had to find some junk to-}
{603}{}{¡NO! ¿Qué estás haciendo?}
{700}{}{Wait a second! You were part of the *original* team?! But, that's got to make you almost 200 years old!}
{701}{}{Well, I suppose that's true, in a way. I was actually born 202 years ago. However, there is no way that I could have lived that long through regular means.}
{702}{}{Continúa. Estoy escuchando.}
{703}{}{When the war started, the other scientists and I used the cryogenic storage chambers. We handed over more control of the facility to the holograms and robots, then put ourselves in the chambers to wait out the worst of the destruction.}
{704}{}{But, the great war was over many, many years ago.}
{705}{}{True. We initially came out of hibernation about 90 years ago, and discovered that this place had deteriorated greatly. Most of the other scientists here continued some of their original research, as they didn't really know what else to do.}
{706}{}{[MÁS]}
{707}{}{I couldn't believe their scientific short-sightedness... their utter lack of imagination! We had an incredible opportunity to do some amazing things. We had the chance to remake things how we saw fit. Sadly, my comrades paid for their lack of vision...}
{708}{}{You killed them!?}
{709}{}{Comprensible.}
{710}{}{Por favor, continúa.}
{711}{}{No, I didn't kill them. But I couldn't have them stay here interfering with my plans. I merely manipulated events here so that they chose to leave.}
{712}{}{Okay, that answers part of the story. But there is still something missing...}
{713}{}{Ah, yes. Sorry about that. I sometimes go off on tangents or my mind just wanders. Great minds, you know? Anyway, I continue to use the tank. I have modified it somewhat, though.}
{714}{}{What modifications have you done?}
{715}{}{Creo que ya he oído bastante. Adiós.}
{716}{}{Well, the first time we used the cryogenic chambers, it was as if I just went to sleep and woke up. But, I realized that was a waste of time. I reset the chamber settings so that I could use it for years at a time, but keep my mind conscious! I use those extended periods to ponder current projects and think up new experiments. By doing so, I can see the long-term effects of my research.}
{717}{}{Did you ever consider that maybe using the chamber like this might be damaging to you somehow?}
{718}{}{Nonsense! If anything I am getting better. I can see things so clearly, now, thanks to my periods of lucid hibernation.}
{719}{}{What a loon! Goodbye.}
{720}{}{That's actually a great idea. Genius! Hey, do you think that I could see this cryogenic chamber?}
{721}{}{Lo que veo. Hablemos de otra cosa.}
{722}{}{Well of course. It's right over there. I had it moved up here some time ago. Keeping the chamber in the sublevels of this facility was just not a wise idea.}
{723}{}{Interesting. So, how does it work?}
{724}{}{Well, of course the scientific principles of cryogenics is quite advanced. However, the functions are governed by the computer here, has a fairly easy interface. [He takes a few minutes showing you how the system works.]}
{725}{}{Thanks for the information, Doctor. I guess I would still like to know about a few other things.}
{726}{}{Thanks for the information, Doctor. Who knows? Information like that just might prove useful someday. Goodbye.}
{727}{}{Well, enough chit-chat. I should be going. Goodbye, Doctor.}
{728}{}{No, it just wouldn't do to have them stay here interfering with my plans... not at all... [The Doctor gazes past you seemingly lost in his thoughts.]}
{729}{}{You know, you are one twisted person. I think I am going to have to show you how I 'experiment' on people. Time to die!}
{730}{}{So, are you happy with this situation? I mean, being the only one here?}
{731}{}{¿Qué más quieres saber?}
{800}{}{Actually, wait one second. You look like an adventurous type. I may have a use for someone of your skills.}
{801}{}{Claro. ¿Qué necesitas?}
{802}{}{No, gracias. Adiós.}
{803}{}{Well, I was out collecting samples at one of my work sites and I seem to have left one of my tools there. Normally
 I would just go and get it myself, but I'm extremely busy at the moment and for the life of me I cannot remember the exact
 spot I left it at. In any case, head northwest from this building and you will find the area where I left my tool. Should
 be a piece cake.}
{804}{}{Me pondré a ello ahora mismo.}
{805}{}{No estoy interesado. Adiós.}
{806}{}{Well, wait. Are you sure you won't help me with a little something?}
{810}{}{Excellent! Now, I must get back to work. [To himself.] It's all going according to plan.}
{811}{}{[HECHO]}
{820}{}{That's too bad. Well, I must be getting back to work. [To himself.] Almost had him. Now, where am I going to find another test subject...}
{821}{}{[HECHO]}
{830}{}{[The man looks up startled.] What the-?!}
{831}{}{I'm still looking for your part.}
{832}{}{Here's your tool. Piece of cake indeed.}
{833}{}{Were you trying to kill me out there? That was a maze full of mutated monsters. This wasn't an ordinary part
 retrieval job, now was it?}
{840}{}{What?! Give me that! [He snatched the tool from your hand.] How did you- Oh, nevermind. Back to the drawing board then...}
{841}{}{[You ignore the man's reaction.] Alright, well if you need anything else, let me know. Bye.}
{850}{}{That's none of your business. [He snatches the tool from your hand.] Now, get out of here. I've got things to do. [He looks
 away muttering to himself.]}
{851}{}{Lo que sea. Adiós.}
{852}{}{I don't think so. You tried to kill me and now I will return the favor. Prepare to die!}
{860}{}{Uh, yes, of course. Well, get to it then.}
{861}{}{[HECHO]}
{900}{}{*Grumbles*}
{901}{}{*To himself* I was sure he wouldn't return.}
{1000}{}{You return the Doctor's forgotten tool.}
