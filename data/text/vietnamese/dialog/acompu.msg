{119}{}{Your eyes widen and your heart quickens as you discover what appears to be an old advertisement for a Garden of Eden
 Creation Kit. The ad depicts a grinning cartoon guy in a vault suit holding up a large case that says, "Survival Kit". It's
 almost as if the smiling bastard is taunting you.}
{120}{}{You browse over the files, which contain mostly government propaganda for how amazing life in the Vaults would be.
 You learn that in the mid-21st century, the US government commissioned Vault-Tec to construct 122 Vaults across the United States.
 These Vaults were meant to serve as shelters for up to 1,000 US citizens in the event of a nuclear holocaust. Within the safe confines
 of the underground Vaults, the Vault Dwellers could live out a luxurious existence as they await the signal informing them that the
 surface world is once again inhabitable.}

{124}{}{According to the ad, the kit includes a "Base Replicator Unit", which "replicates food and basic items needed for building
 your new world", a "Holodisc Reader with Library", which "includes selections from the Library of Congress, complete set of encyclopedias,
 and other life saving information, all contained on four-hundred and sixty handy holodiscs!" and it even contains a "Miniature Pen Flashlight!"
 Surely, this miracle device is exactly what you need to save your dying village.}

{500}{}{As you read over more articles, you learn the GECK was developed by Future-Tec, a division of Vault-Tec, and that
 it was standard issue in all Vault-Tec vaults. It was meant to be used upon exiting a Vault, to help re-establish life in
 the harsh environments of a world devastated by nuclear war.}
{501}{}{Upon further reading, you discover the GECK isn't quite the miracle device the ad made it out to be. The "Base Replicator"
 is actually nothing more than a fertilizer system containing food seeds, soil supplements, and chemicals specifically engineered to
 turn arid wasteland into fertile soil. Its claim that it can "build basic items" actually alludes to new codes it provides for the
 Vault's machines, allowing them to create new items from the dispensers. The GECK also contains schematics for basic force fields
 and the construction of "sand-crete" walls and buildings.}
{502}{}{[THÊM]}
{503}{}{It seems the GECK itself is meant to be disassembled over the course of its use. You read an example of how its cold fusion
 power source is intended be used for main city power production. The GECK even contains instructions on disassembling sections of the
 Vault to create homes and defensive structures for the new community. As you finish reading over the files, you decide that even though
 it's not the magical device the Elder seems to think it is, finding a GECK is still your best option if you hope to save your tribe.}
