{100}{}{You see Mrs. Wright.}
{150}{}{You see a chunky, sad-faced woman. She seems to be depressed and is sighing to herself.}
{151}{}{You see Mrs. Wright. She seems to be depressed and is sighing to herself.}
{175}{}{You see a plump, rosy-cheeked woman. She seems to be in good spirits and is humming to herself.}
{176}{}{You see Mrs. Wright. She seems to be in good spirits and is humming to herself.}

{201}{}{How could he do this to me?}
{205}{}{Another fine Reno day!}
{206}{}{::Whistle while you work...::}
{207}{}{Ah, to work! Such pleasure in doing a task and doing it well!}
{208}{}{::Hmmmm-hmmm-hmmm-hm-hm -hmmmm::}
{209}{}{Another fine Reno night!}
{210}{}{(The woman jumps.) Oh, my! You gave me such a fright! (Squints at you.) Yes, yes?}
{211}{}{(Mrs. Wright jumps.) Oh, my! You gave me such a fright! (Squints at you.) Well, hello again!}
{212}{}{Who, who?}
{213}{}{Hello, hello!}
{214}{}{You not mom... Mom? Mommmm...?! Mom! Me go look for Mom}
{215}{}{Ông là ai?}
{216}{}{I noticed you humming to yourself and thought I would stop and speak to you a moment, ma'am. Beautiful weather we're
 having, isn't it?}
{217}{}{Sorry. I thought you were someone else.}
{220}{}{(Looks puzzled, then looks you over.) }
{222}{}{(She fishes in her robes for a moment, pulls forth some items and presses them into your hands.) Here you go, dear.
 Take these.}
{223}{}{Thanxxx}
{224}{}{Wander off}
{230}{}{(Oh, you poor dear! Too much sun... }
{231}{}{Oh, you poor dear... don't you have a home? }
{232}{}{(Fishes in her robes for a moment.) I wish I had some food or water for you...}
{240}{}{Why, yes, yes it is. (Smiles.) I am Missus Ethyl Wright, head of the Temperance Union here in New Reno. And who might you be?}
{241}{}{I am a traveler looking for a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Have you ever heard of one?}
{242}{}{I am a traveler looking for a place called Vault 13. Have you seen it?}
{243}{}{Temperance Union?}
{244}{}{Mrs. Wright? Is your husband the head of Family Wright?}
{245}{}{You're Richard's mother, right? I heard he passed away recently.}
{246}{}{I'm sorry, but I have to be going.}
{250}{}{Me? Why, I am Missus Ethyl Wright, head of the Temperance Union here in New Reno. (Studies you.) And who might you be?}
{251}{}{I am }
{252}{}{I am a traveler with some questions about New Reno...}
{254}{}{I'd love to stay and talk, but I have to be going.}
{260}{}{Oh, my! You're a TRIBAL, aren't you? Your accent gave it away! (She raises her voice and starts speaking slowly.)
 WELL -- MAY I BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO OUR CITY!}
{261}{}{What you say? Me simple tribal. No understanda youa.}
{262}{}{Woman, I am neither deaf nor stupid. I can understand you QUITE well without you raising your voice.}
{263}{}{Uh, thank you. I had some questions about New Reno...}
{264}{}{I HAVE TO GO NOW.}
{270}{}{I SAID, LET *ME*... (Points at herself.) ...WELCOME YOU... (Points at you.) ...TO... (Gestures at the city around her.) ...CITY OF LIGHTS!}
{272}{}{Perhaps you think this high-tech armor I'm wearing somehow magically attached itself to me. Look, cut out the 'tribal' talk,
 all right?}
{273}{}{Look, do you think this weapon I'm carrying is some mystic totem that I keep around for show? Cut the 'tribal'
 talk, all right?}
{274}{}{I BETTER GO NOW BEFORE I LOSE MY TEMPER.}
{280}{}{Oh! Excuse me! (Seems startled.) Pardons, pardons! It's just that I thought... well... nevermind, let's put that all behind us.
 What can I do for you?}
{281}{}{I had some questions about New Reno...}
{282}{}{Nevermind. I have to be going.}
{290}{}{(Squints, frowns.) I'm sorry, the Garden of... what? No, I'm sorry, I've never heard of such a thing.}
{291}{}{I had some other questions...}
{292}{}{Nevermind then, I better be going.}
{300}{}{Vault 13? (Looks puzzled.) My goodness, no, I haven't... well, no, wait. That's untrue. There IS Vault City to the northeast.
 Is that what you are looking for?}
{301}{}{No, wrong place. But maybe you can help me with some other questions...}
{302}{}{Could be. Can you help me with some other questions...?}
{303}{}{It might be. Goodbye... and thanks for the information.}
{310}{}{Why, yes! (Wags her finger at you.) New Reno is a beautiful city, but there is SIN here - much of which can be traced
 back to the evils of alcohol... or as you tribesmen call it... (Pauses dramatically.) ...FIREWATER!}
{311}{}{Uh, we "primitives" call it alcohol, too.}
{312}{}{Yes, but what about this Temperance Union?}
{313}{}{I have to be going. I think I can hear my tribesmen calling.}
{315}{}{(Rambles on.) }
{316}{}{The Temperance Union was established to help people turn away from the poison of drink and turn towards more
 hard-working pursuits.}
{317}{}{Oh. Well, how ab --}
{318}{}{Such as wha --}
{320}{}{(Looks shocked.) Surely you are mistaken. Even a primitive tribal such as yourself can't
 seriously mean th--}
{321}{}{Nothing like a little communal love, some gambling, and rounding off the day with a few jugs of fermented mare's milk. That's what makes being a TRIBESMAN so great!}
{322}{}{Nothing like a little communal love, some gambling, and rounding off the day with a few jugs of fermented mare's milk. That's what makes being a TRIBESWOMAN so great!}
{323}{}{I'll leave it to your imagination. Based on the response above, I think it'd be better that way.}
{324}{}{By the balls of the sky spirits, yes! I myself like to indulge in all THREE of those sins. }
{325}{}{By Richard Millhouse Nixon and his mother! I don't know what practices you tribespeople follow in your dens of iniquity,
 but in New Reno, things are changing! We are a CIVILIZED people!}
{326}{}{We have none of the evils you mention in my village. Maybe we could teach you "civilized" people some things.}
{327}{}{Who's all in your organization?}
{328}{}{What does your organization do?}
{329}{}{I see. Thanks for sharing your insights. Goodbye.}
{330}{}{(Thinks.) Well, good Father Tully for one.}
{331}{}{(Thinks.) Well, good Father Tully was one of our members. Before he died.}
{332}{}{Uh, Father Tully is the worst consumer of 'firewater' I have ever seen. I almost got drunk just from the vapors.}
{333}{}{Father Tully?}
{335}{}{Actually, I've spent too long talking already. I better be going.}
{340}{}{Now, you listen here. (Frowns.) I'm not going to tolerate that kind of slander. The good Father has had his struggles
 with alcohol, but through the help of the Union, he has fought for his soul and triumphed!}
{341}{}{I know for a FACT that the good Father RUNS, not walks, to the nearest source of hootch he can see... if he hasn't ALREADY
 drunk himself blind.}
{342}{}{It's not slander. It's just that the great spiritual leader of New Reno is about as healthy as... well, the city itself.}
{343}{}{Okay. No arguments here. So what does the Union do?}
{344}{}{Well, that's good news. I better be going.}
{345}{}{Oh yes, he is a spiritual leader of New Reno. He runs the only Chapel in New Reno. You simply MUST speak to him. He is
 quite inspiring!}
{346}{}{Okay, maybe I will. So what does the Temperance Union do?}
{347}{}{Maybe I'll go look for him right now.}
{350}{}{Hmmph! Of all the crass rudeness! If you see me again, you had best simply pass by in silence.}
{351}{}{That's the plan.}
{352}{}{Đư?c r?i.}
{355}{}{Why, yes, yes, he is. (Squints at you again.) I'm sorry, do you know my husband?}
{356}{}{Yes, I know him. The Wright family controls the distribution of alcohol in New Reno.}
{357}{}{Not personally, but I know the Wrights control the distribution of alcohol in New Reno.}
{358}{}{Không.}
{359}{}{Not really. Look, I have to be going.}
{360}{}{Oh. (Blinks.) So what is it I can do for you?}
{361}{}{So what are these questions you have?}
{362}{}{(Jumps.) Oh, my! You gave me such a fright! (Squints.) Well, hello again!}
{363}{}{What were you saying about the Temperance Union before?}
{364}{}{I'm looking for a Garden of Eden Creation Kit.}
{365}{}{I'm looking for a place called Vault 13.}
{366}{}{Your husband is head of Family Wright, correct?}
{368}{}{Nothing, actually. I have to be going.}
{369}{}{Sorry, I don't have time to talk right now. Goodbye.}
{375}{}{(Frowns.) Now what IS this foolishness you're speaking of? "Alcohol distribution in New Reno?" I know my husband
 is inclined to drink, but he IS breaking the habit...}
{376}{}{Along with breaking the legs of anyone who gets in the way of his little alcohol empire.}
{377}{}{Ethyl, in case you hadn't NOTICED, your husband is the leader of a crime family that sells alcohol to all of New Reno.
 Tossing one back now and then is perhaps the least of his crimes.}
{378}{}{Oh, I was thinking of a different Mr. Wright. Nevermind. Goodbye.}
{380}{}{Why... my goodness! Of all the cheek! (Takes deep breath.) }
{381}{}{That is a VERY serious accusation, young man.}
{382}{}{That is a VERY serious accusation, young lady.}
{383}{}{I realize that, but --}
{384}{}{Look, lady, maybe you sh --}
{385}{}{No, YOU look! It's no secret that - in the PAST - my husband had a private still in the city. Nonetheless, he swore it was
 for his use only, and AT MY REQUEST, he has dismantled it!}
{386}{}{Oh, really? Well, maybe you --}
{387}{}{Well, look, he d --}
{390}{}{(Frowns, puts her hands on hips.) I will look into it, you can rest assured! And if I find that you are wrong, you had
 best leave this town! Meet me at the church tomorrow morning, and we will speak again.}
{392}{}{All right. I will. See you then.}
{395}{}{(Smile dies.) Yes, my son Richard... he... yes, he left us much too soon. I... hmmm. Yes. (Looks at her hands.) I...}
{396}{}{I heard it was a Jet overdose... is that right?}
{397}{}{Look, nevermind. Forget I brought it up. I had some other questions...}
{398}{}{Nevermind. I better be going.}
{400}{}{(Jaw tightens.) That filthy poison! I thought that I'd taught him to stay AWAY from that stuff, and then...}
{401}{}{Can you tell me where he might have gotten the Jet?}
{405}{}{I don't know! (Hands clench into fists.) They sell that poison on every corner here in New Reno! EVERYWHERE you go, they're
 peddling it...}
{406}{}{Do you know any specific dealers?}
{407}{}{Look, forget I brought it up. I had some other questions...}
{410}{}{Not by name. They know enough to run when they see me coming... but they cluster like flies along Virgin Street at the
 front of town and outside the casinos.}
{411}{}{I see. I had some other questions...}
{415}{}{Keep your distance, you lust demon! You who fornicate on film for the corruption of the masses!}
{416}{}{Well, I never! You have some sand coming back around here! You who fornicate on film for the
 corruption of the masses!}
{417}{}{Hunh? Me who forks on flim for eruption of whut?}
{418}{}{Aiiieee! Big wurds! Big wurds! Must get away!}
{419}{}{That's me. You interested in a job? I kind of like big women like you. (Wiggle eyebrows suggestively.) Loosen
 that garter strap a little and we'll get down to business.}
{420}{}{Look, I was young, I needed the money...}
{421}{}{I can see we'll have lots to talk about. Goodbye.}
{425}{}{Out! Out of here at once!}
{426}{}{Me go! Me go!}
{427}{}{All right, all right! I'm leaving!}
{428}{}{Jeez-Louise. Loosen those drawstrings a little before they cut off your circulation.}
{430}{}{(Squints at you, then her gaze travels to your slaver brand. Her tone becomes glacial.) }
{431}{}{Yes?}
{432}{}{You again. We have NOTHING to talk about.}
{433}{}{Me... uh... me... me wanted to... uh... me looking for... uh... dam! Me hate bein stoopid! Me hate!}
{434}{}{I... uh... ooooh, shiny thing!}
{435}{}{I had some questions...}
{436}{}{I can see talking isn't going to help matters here. Goodbye.}
{440}{}{I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you. Good day.}
{441}{}{I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you. Good night.}
{442}{}{::Shrug and walk away.::}
{443}{}{All right then. Good day.}
{444}{}{All right then. Good night.}
{450}{}{(You see Mrs. Wright. She looks crushed.)}
{451}{}{Uh... Ethyl, are you okay?}
{452}{}{So... what did you find?}
{453}{}{Ah-ha! Was I right or was I right?}
{454}{}{I'm sorry. I'll be back.}
{460}{}{All true... everything you said was true. (Sighs.) The still was not dismantled. Not at all! (Frowns.) I trusted that man, but
 alcohol made him LIE to me! *Lie to his own wife!*}
{461}{}{::Let her vent.::}
{462}{}{Oh, yes, Ethyl... further proof of the evil of alcohol. It can make people do terrible things. ESPECIALLY when the twin
 devils of money and power are involved.}
{463}{}{You may need some time alone... I'll be back later.}
{470}{}{(Smolders.) I will MAKE him keep the promise he made, if I have to destroy that still with my own hands. Then
 Orville and I shall have words! We'll see what that little weasel says then!}
{471}{}{Don't worry about, Mrs. Wright. I took care of it already.}
{472}{}{Where is the still? I can destroy it for you.}
{473}{}{No, let me handle it. It's beneath the train station, right? I'll take care of it.}
{474}{}{Good idea. Maybe you should go destroy the still.}
{475}{}{I'll be back later, then.}
{480}{}{...it's in the train station basement behind our home! }
{481}{}{Tear it down! Wreck it! Leave NOTHING!}
{482}{}{All right...}
{490}{}{I will, by tarnation! (Rolls up sleeves. To your surprise, she has arms like a weight lifter.) Thank you for opening
 my eyes, stranger. I'll put my husband back on the straight and narrow, even if it KILLS him.}
{491}{}{Well, have fun storming the castle.}
{500}{}{(You see Ethyl. As you approach, she looks up hopefully.) Is it...?}
{501}{}{I smashed it to the ground. Nothin' left. ALL taken care of.}
{502}{}{Not yet. Where was this still again?}
{503}{}{No, I haven't wrecked the still yet. I'll be back when I'm done.}
{510}{}{It's in the train station basement near our home! Tear it down! Wreck it! Leave NOTHING!}
{512}{}{I'll be back when I'm done.}
{515}{}{(Tear wells up in her eye.) Thank you, stranger. You have dealt a blow to the evil here in New Reno. I don't know
 how to thank you...}
{516}{}{No thanks necessary. Take care, Mrs. Wright.}
{517}{}{I'm a little light on cash...}
{520}{}{Then we can remedy that. Follow me.}
{521}{}{(Follow her.)}
{522}{}{Actually, no thanks necessary. Take care, Mrs. Wright.}
{525}{}{Here you go. Everything in this locker is yours. Some money to help you in your travels... and
 a handy tool that I have found useful in pounding sense into the particularly mule-headed. Thank you for all
 you've done.}
{526}{}{Thank YOU, Mrs. Wright.}
{530}{}{Thanks for your help, }
{535}{}{New Reno can't exist on gambling and alcohol and prostitution and expect to survive! Oh, no! Not while Ethyl Wright is at
 the helm, it won't! No, sirree!}
{536}{}{But people LIKE gambling, drinking and whoring. I know I do.}
{539}{}{I'm sorry, but I just remembered I have a pressing engagement elsewhere.}
{540}{}{(Puffs up.) Perhaps it is standard practice in your tribes to slander others in public, but here in New Reno you have some
 sand coming up to me in public and speaking ill of my husband!}
{541}{}{Look, all I'm saying is...}
{542}{}{Truth hurts. I can see you're going to be in for a lot of pain. Goodbye.}
{543}{}{Fine. Goodbye.}
{545}{}{Furthermore, he has resolved to help me and any other unfortunates addicted to alcohol break the habit. Shameful!
 To even SUGGEST my husband was selling the alcohol to others is...}
{546}{}{Completely true. Mrs. Wright, your husband is selling alcohol here in New Reno and promoting drunkenness. It is making
 the city a worse place to live. Help me, and we can put an end to the whole nasty business.}
{547}{}{If you don't believe me, check out the Reno train station. You'll see what I mean.}
{548}{}{I see we have nothing more to say to each other unless I can prove it to you.}
{550}{}{But now, I don't want you to hurt any of my children, no waving guns! They're not bad children, they've just been... misled.
 I'll have to see what I can do to change that...}
{551}{}{Okay, don't worry... there'll be no casualties.}
{552}{}{I'll be back when I'm done. I have some other things to take care of first.}
{553}{}{Uh, I can't promise that... maybe you should get someone else to take care of the problem.}
{1251}{}{. I had some questions about New Reno...}
{1415}{}{(Jumps.) Oh, my! (Squints at you, then purses her lips disapprovingly.) Well, I never! }
{1430}{}{(Jumps.) Oh, my! }
{1431}{}{(Squints at you, then her gaze becomes glacial.) }
{1480}{}{You'll destroy it? I... well, all right... (Builds up steam..) }
{1530}{}{. I'll make sure Family Wright keeps to the straight and narrow from now on.}
