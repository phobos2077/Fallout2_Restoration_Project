{102}{}{Welcome to EPA's Top Secret Research and Development Terminal. Error initializing quick access procedure. Please
 search for something specific.}
{103}{}{Search for anything of importance.}
{104}{}{Logoff.}
{105}{}{After 30 minutes of sifting through all the files you find four of which appear useful. Please make a choice below.}
{106}{}{Access FEV history log.}
{107}{}{Access file on Epilepsy cure.}
{108}{}{Keep searching.}
{109}{}{Please make a choice below.}
{110}{}{As tensions continued to mount between the US and China, a fear at the forefront of the minds of our military officials
 was that the Chinese would deploy biological weapons against American troops. As a result, West Tek, a major high tech
 defense contractor, was hired to develop a counter agent. This led to West Tek's research on the Pan-Immunity Virion
 Project (PVP) with the intent of creating immunity in soldiers by restructuring their DNA. During testing of PVP in 2076,
 abnormal side effects were observed in test subjects. The test animals began to grow dramatically and their brain activity
 increased.}
{111}{}{[THÊM]}
{112}{}{Seeing the potential there, the Army quickly commandeered the project and renamed it FEV: Forced Evolutionary Virus.
 Not content with mere immunity to disease, FEV would potentially turn soldiers into abnormally strong and intelligent
 "supermen". Once testing on animals reached its logical conclusion, FEV research was moved to its current location at
 the Mariposa Military Base. There, we have learned that the testing will proceed to the next level, as they begin top
 secret testing on military prisoners. We eagerly anticipate the results of these exciting experiments.}
{113}{}{Back.}
{120}{}{One of our researches, Dr. Hodkin, has made a wonderful discovery in his recent research on the way the human brain
 processes verbal responses. Apparently, by repeating a series of letters with the proper inflections, a listener can be
 cured of a number of neurological diseases, such as autism or epilepsy. Included in this log is the exact string of letters
 (and the proper inflections) used by Dr. Hodkin in his experiments. This is wonderful news and is a great beginning to
 further research into treatment for chronic neurological disorders.}
{121}{}{This might be useful. Make note of the string and search for something else.}
{130}{}{You find nothing more of interest.}
{131}{}{You still find nothing more of interest.}
{132}{}{Maybe if you search a little more, you might find something?}
{133}{}{Maybe one more search?}
{134}{}{After much painful searching, you come across a hidden file.}
{135}{}{Access file labeled: Mass Fluoridation Project.}
{136}{}{In the continued effort to make the citizens of the United States more controllable, the inclusion of sodium
 fluoride in all available drinking water is effective immediately. Long term effects in testing has resulted in
 subjects becoming more "stupid and docile." In addition, it was observed that sodium fluoride caused slight damage to
 a specific part of the brain, making it more difficult for the person affected to defend his freedom and causing the
 individual to become more docile towards authority.}
{137}{}{[THÊM]}
{138}{}{In our most recent experimentation, we have chosen military official, General J. Ripper, as a subject. Initially,
 he was unaware of our intent but now seems to have caught on. He has become obsessed with the phrase "precious bodily
 fluids" and avoids drinking any substance he does not know from where it originated. He has even stopped having sexual
 intercourse as he fears that women seek "the life essence."}
{139}{}{Back.}
{150}{}{Gender Modification.}
{151}{}{Virus-laden Fruit Flies.}
{160}{}{Dr. Glen Wood has achieved a new breakthrough in his research into gender modification that he claims will
 revolutionize our countries espionage efforts. With just a simple procedure, a man could become a woman, or vice versa.
 Dr. Wood has insisted that he be the first to undergo the radical transformation. Once the operation is complete, he has
 requested that he, or she, be referred to as Glenda.}
{170}{}{The mutant fruit flies are now successfully carrying the virus. However, before we unleash them on foreign soil,
 it's been decided that we shall first expose the fruit flies to a small isolated American community, where we can monitor
 the effects outside of a lab environment. The civilian casualties that are likely to result are an unfortunate, yet
 necessary, sacrifice. Besides, any true American would be honored to give up their life for the good of our great nation.}
{200}{}{You learn about the true intent of water fluoridation.}
{311}{}{Whirrrr....}
{312}{}{BEEP!!}
{313}{}{Clunk...}
{1311}{}{Don't give up. Something is bound to be found.}
