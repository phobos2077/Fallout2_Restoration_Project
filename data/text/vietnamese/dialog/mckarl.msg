 thars anything ya needs (hic) just come see me. By the way, (hic) me name's Karl.}
{203}{}{Sure, Karl; now that you mention it, I'm looking for an item called a GECK. Any clues as to
 where I might find one?}
{204}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Take care of yourself, Karl.}
{205}{}{What kinds of person are ya? (hic) Playing tricks on a poor homeless farm-(hic)-er. Leave me
 alone!}
{206}{}{Yeah... (hic) Some sort of lizard (hic) I hear. Never seen one, though.}
{207}{}{No, I'm looking for a GECK, not a gecko.}
{208}{}{Never mind. Thanks for the info.}
{209}{}{Oh! Ya means gecko... (hic) Yeah, it's a liz-(hic)-ard about so big. [Karl holds his hands out to
 show the size. You can't tell, but the lizard is either 3 inches long or 3 feet long.]}
{210}{}{Let me try to explain. I'm not looking for a lizard called a gecko. I'm looking for an object
 called a GECK.}
{212}{}{Why didn't you say so? (hic) I know where to get it... (hic) Garden of... [Karl falls flat on his
 face and passes out.]}
{213}{}{[Maybe when Karl wakes up, you can talk to him again.]}
{214}{}{Bless you! (hic) Ya saved me life.}
{215}{}{I'm looking for a GECK; can you help me?}
{216}{}{Don't mention it. I'll see you around, Karl.}
{217}{}{Um... (hic) I'm not real hungry right now... (hic) How about if you give me the money and I'll get
 it later? (hic)}
{219}{}{You shyster. I'll bet you use the money you collect to buy drugs, don't you?}
{220}{}{Shi... shy... shick... Whatever you just sed? (hic) Take that back... (hic) Whatever it means, it can't
 be good.}
{221}{}{[Before you can reply, Karl falls forward and passes out.]}
{222}{}{Thaaaats okay... (hic) I don't suppose you have any liquid refresh-(hic)-ment. It get's mighty (hic)
 cold out here at night.}
{224}{}{You are truly (hic) my bestest friend in this whole (hic) cursed world. [Karl proceeds to drink
 the liquid refreshment, at which point he then passes out]}
{225}{}{Oh well, maybe you'll be able to talk to Karl later.}
{226}{}{You are truly (hic) my bestest friend in this whole (hic) cursed world. [Karl opens the bottle
 and proceeds to drink -- and then proceeds to yark all over you.] Ptui! What the-?! Are you trying to
 poison me or something?! Get out of here!}
{227}{}{Why, thank (hic) you; you're so (hic) kind. Why don't I help you with that heavy purse? [Karl
 reaches into your purse and takes half your money.] Very kind of you (hic) if you needs anything,
 don't hesitate to ask.}

{230}{}{Jooky... hic... It's a party in a can.}
{231}{}{Maybe later, then.}
{232}{}{Gee... (hic) ...thanks. Maybe I can buy a (hic) bullet to shoot myself with. (hic) Course I'd
 have to save (hic) up for the gun.}
{233}{}{You mean... I can go home? No more ghosts? [Karl breaks down and cries. Boy, nothing like seeing
 a grown man cry.] Thank you, I can finally go home again!}
{234}{}{Where?! Nooooooooo! They've found me!}
{235}{}{Why yes, I had the biggest garden (hic) a person could want. Except (hic) where I'm from, we
 calls it a farm...}
{236}{}{Don't you remember? We were talking about the GECK, and you mentioned a garden.}
{237}{}{Forget it, this is going nowhere.}
{238}{}{Hey! (hic) You're kind a cute! Let's me and you go out back (hic) and gets better acquainted. I can
 pay... I've got a $1000. [Karl leers suggestively to you.]}
{239}{}{You do know you're talking to a man, don't you?}
{240}{}{Sure, but it'll cost you $1000.}
{241}{}{Thanks for the offer, but I'd rather talk about finding a GECK.}
{242}{}{Not on your life!}
{243}{}{Yer sooo purty... (hic) If you don't says anything, I won't. (hic)}
{244}{}{[You can hardly keep from gagging.] I've got to go.}
{245}{}{OK, $1000.}
{246}{}{[You and Karl slip out back for a quickie. To your surprise, you find that you enjoyed it.]}
{247}{}{[He sobers up quickly and begins to tell his tale.] I used to be an upstanding citizen before
 coming here. I was a peaceful farmer that worked the fields as hard as any man -- until they started
 showing up at night. All glowing, with pasty white skins... Spooked the hell out of me, it did. Night
 after night they showed up and stole crops and cattle alike; I could do nothing to stop them. I know
 what you're gonna say - "Why didn't you ask for help?" I tell ya, I did! Nobody would believe me, they
 thought I was crazy. Finally, it just became too much for me. I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I just up
 and left and came here -- and here I've been ever since. [Karl starts to weep uncontrollably. You
 decide to leave him with his misery.]}
{248}{}{Oh jeez. I must have dropped my money along the way. Here's $}
{249}{}{.}
{250}{}{Zzz}
{251}{}{Zzzzzz}
{252}{}{Zzzzzzzzz}
{253}{}{Zzzzzzzzzzzz}
{254}{}{Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz}
{255}{}{*snort* *grunt* *snort*}
{260}{}{Oh jeez. I must have dropped my money along the way. Here's $}
{261}{}{. It's all I've got.}
{262}{}{Oh jeez. I must have dropped my money along the way. Sorry, it was fun anyway.}
{300}{}{I'm going home, thanks to you!}
{400}{}{You have sent Karl on his way back to Modoc.}
