{100}{}{You see a person carrying a powerful weapon.}
{101}{}{You see a member of Broken Hills' trading and protection corps.}
{102}{}{You see a person carrying a powerful weapon and covered in the dust of the trail.}
{103}{}{I tell ya, one more group of highwaymen and I'm wearing dynamite on the next trip.}
{104}{}{Sure could use some more help on the caravans.}
{105}{}{Man... Unity Patrol work gets really, really old.}
{106}{}{So then I saw this tribal comin' and... never mind.}
{107}{}{One more "Rainbow Patrol" crack and I'm gonna kill someone.}
{108}{}{I swear, if the bandits get any worse, we'll all die in the next year.}
{109}{}{What podunk village are you from?}
{110}{}{Buy a working person a drink?}
{111}{}{I'm too tired from that caravan work to talk.}
{112}{}{You need something, you talk to Bill, the Outfitter.}
{113}{}{You'd think after all this time tryin' to civilize the wasteland we'd be a little closer to our goal.}
{114}{}{I'm sick of all this human/mutant squabbling. Ain't we supposed to be an example?}
{115}{}{Whaddya' want? Can't you see I'm resting?}
{116}{}{When's the next caravan leave?}
{117}{}{Patrol, patrol, patrol... all I ever do around here.}
{118}{}{I think I need a nap.}
{119}{}{I deserve a raise. This is hazardous duty.}
{200}{}{Help you?}
{201}{}{Yes, I'm looking for the caravan master.}
{202}{}{I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Chad.}
{203}{}{Ông là ai?}
{204}{}{No, thanks.}
{205}{}{In that case, you wanna talk to Bill, the Outfitter of Broken Hills. He is inside that building over there.}
{206}{}{I have some more questions.}
{207}{}{Cám ơn. T?m bi?t.}
{208}{}{You got questions, maybe I got answers. Whaddya wanna know?}
{209}{}{What's he like?}
{210}{}{Can he be trusted?}
{211}{}{Where does he get his money?}
{212}{}{What's his history?}
{213}{}{Forget it. See you later.}
{214}{}{Me? I'm }
{215}{}{. I'm a guard for Bill's caravans. Anything else?}
{216}{}{What's he like? Well, he's friendly, but abrasive. He's a good boss, and usually fair to us. He
 doesn't treat us badly or anything, if that's what you mean. Any more questions?}
{217}{}{Well, he's a little shady, I guess... but then, so are most people these days. Any other questions?}
{218}{}{I always kind of assumed he'd brought it with him -- and plenty of it, at that. It's not the
 sort of thing you ask a guy, you know. Any more questions?}
{219}{}{I have no idea what his history is. I mean, just about all of us caravan guards are drifters
 who came here for the job. Figure he's another one who had to vacate someplace else in a hurry. Any
 more questions?}
{220}{}{Yes.}
{221}{}{No.}
{222}{}{All right. See ya, then.}
{223}{}{Chào.}
