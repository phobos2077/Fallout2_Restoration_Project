{100}{}{You see a short, rotund Shi man.}
{101}{}{You see Dr. Wong Yi Tze.}
{102}{}{You see a short, rotund Shi man.}
{103}{}{May I assist you with something?}
{104}{}{Daghi nu?}
{105}{}{You who?}
{106}{}{I hear you have someone else's spleen.}
{107}{}{Ông là ai?}
{108}{}{What do you do here?}
{109}{}{No, thanks. That's all.}
{110}{}{I must confess, I do not speak your tongue. Perhaps you ought to speak to Ken Lee, he understands many different languages.}
{111}{}{Aagh!}
{112}{}{I am Dr. Wong. I am the head scientist of this installation.}
{113}{}{More questions, please.}
{114}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{115}{}{I oversee the scientific experiments we create and run here. I also am in charge of the computer network.}
{116}{}{What are you planning?}
{117}{}{How does one get access to the computer network?}
{118}{}{I have other questions.}
{119}{}{I see. Bye.}
{120}{}{Ah, but if I tell you our plans, then everyone will know. I'm afraid they are secret plans, for now.}
{121}{}{Fine, fine. I have other questions.}
{122}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{123}{}{How about if I stick a gun under your nose and force you to tell me?}
{124}{}{Why, one learns how to hack into it, or how to make friends with one of my underlings. I'm joking, of course, about hacking into it - if you were to do that, I'd send someone after you to kill you. [He smiles to show he means no offense.]}
{125}{}{Would you really kill me?}
{126}{}{So you wouldn't have any real objections to me getting into the computer?}
{127}{}{I have some other questions.}
{128}{}{Sure you would. Bye.}
{129}{}{Then I would have to regard it as a threat and warn you that such a course of action might be detrimental to your health.}
{130}{}{Let's give it a try.}
{131}{}{I was just kidding. I have other questions.}
{132}{}{[He smiles] We must protect our honor, stranger.}
{133}{}{Err, right. So would you have any real objections to me getting into the computer?}
{134}{}{Riiight. I have other questions.}
{135}{}{I'll bet. Bye.}
{136}{}{If you can convince my subordinates into doing so. But I certainly won't.}
{137}{}{What if I shoved a gun under your nose?}
{138}{}{Great. Well, I have more questions.}
{139}{}{Hmm. I see. Well, so long.}
{140}{}{Ahh, yes! Indeed. I will prepare it with fava beans and a nice Chianti.}
{141}{}{You've still got it? Good. Chip needs it back.}
{142}{}{That's a human spleen, you sick bastard!}
{143}{}{You do know that you're supposed to serve liver with that wine instead of spleen, right?}
{144}{}{That's a human spleen, you know.}
{145}{}{Who is this Chip? It's my spleen now, and I'm having it for dinner.}
{146}{}{Chip's the original owner of the spleen. He was drunk and sold it to Lao Chou.}
{147}{}{He needs it to survive, you know. It came from inside his body.}
{148}{}{Then maybe I'd better kill you for it.}
{149}{}{A deal is a deal. He can't have it. Sorry, but we made a bargain and just because Chip regrets it now doesn't mean he can go back on his deal.}
{150}{}{[MORE]}
{151}{}{It's a human spleen? Lao Chou didn't tell me that!}
{152}{}{Yet, because of the rudeness of the messenger, I believe I will hold all parties to the bargain. I will experiment on it instead.}
{153}{}{Tell your friend to come by for it within the next day, and I will gladly return it to him. I just hope you can find a way to replace it in his body in time.}
{154}{}{Very well.}
{155}{}{Ha ha! Yes, I too saw that old movie. Wait... what are you saying? Are you saying that...?}
{156}{}{Yes, it's a human spleen.}
{157}{}{Actually, I would object to that. You have not shown yourself to be of good character. Indeed, I do not know why I am talking to you. Good day.}
{158}{}{[XONG]}
{159}{}{Aiee! Guards! The lao wai intruder is here!}
{160}{}{You have certain schematics to give to me?}
{161}{}{Ken Lee told me to give these to you.}
{162}{}{Yes. Now what do I get?}
{163}{}{No, not yet.}
{164}{}{Speak to Ken Lee, and he shall discuss what happens in your future. Thank you. We shall be able to verify some of our test data with these. Good day.}
{165}{}{I actually had other questions.}
{166}{}{So long.}
{200}{}{I found this corpse stashed over at the Hubologists' base. I believe it might be your missing Xeno Project specimen.}
{201}{}{Yes, it is indeed! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this specimen. Thank you for retrieving this.}
{202}{}{No problem. See you later.}
{203}{}{Hold on there. No one said I did this for free.}
{204}{}{Correct. Nor did anyone ask you to retrieve the subject. You did that and brought it here of your own volition. Now the stolen subject has been returned to its rightful owners, and we thank you for it.}
{205}{}{That's nice, but I found it, so if you want it back, then it's going to cost you.}
{206}{}{I don't have time for this... Guards!}
{207}{}{[The man looks like he is about to yell, then calms down.] Fine. Here is $500. More than enough for something
 that always belonged to us. Now leave, I'm a busy man.}
{208}{}{Pleasure doing business with you. Bye.}
{209}{}{Oh, shit!}
{210}{}{Let's dance!}
{211}{}{You recover the missing Xeno Program specimen.}
{220}{}{So where is it then? Are you trying to play games with me?}
{221}{}{Sorry, I like to try and hoard as many items as I can. It's kinda my thing.}
{230}{}{I don't have time for this. Come back when you have the specimen.}
{240}{}{[He sniffs the air.] What is that smell? Like rotten meat. [He looks at you and raises an eyebrow.]}
{241}{}{Oh, you must be smelling this body I found. I'm not really sure why I'm carrying it around, to be honest.}
{242}{}{Huh-huh! [You pull out the decomposing corpse] Stinky body! U want?}
{250}{}{Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this subject. Thank you.}
{251}{}{No, I do not want-- Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in . . . [He notices your blank stare.] Ahem. I mean, thank you for the body. Good job. Don't bring any more though. This is enough. Bye now!}
{252}{}{Bye Bye!}
{253}{}{Me hoard tings. Me hide it.}
{300}{}{So what's the deal with this Dr. Sheng?}
{310}{}{How do you know about Dr. Sheng? Eh, I suppose it doesn't matter. Dr. Sheng Ming was a brilliant, but rather unpleasant man who served as my predecessor. He is no longer of any great relevance here.}
{311}{}{Well if he's not relevant to you, then why should *I* care? Let me ask you something else.}
{312}{}{So what happened to him?}
{320}{}{What happened? I'd say he lost his mind. During his experiments he stumbled upon something which I admit was rather remarkable, but it was also extremely dangerous and in no way related to the goals of the Shi. But that did not matter to Dr. Sheng. He became obsessed with his creation and since his experiments were deemed too dangerous to continue here, he decided to take them elsewhere. He left on sabbatical and never returned. That is when I stepped up to fill his position.}
{321}{}{What kind of experiments was Dr. Sheng performing? And what exactly was his big discovery?}
{322}{}{So where is Dr. Sheng now?}
{330}{}{As a man of science, I respect your inquisitive nature. However, I'm afraid I am not willing to share the secrets of the Shi with you, stranger.}
{331}{}{So where is Dr. Sheng now?}
{332}{}{Fine, you keep your fancy secrets. I have secrets of my own, you know. Better secrets than you could ever possibly imagine.}
{340}{}{[He smiles politely.] I'm sure you do. Now if you will excuse me, I have plenty of work that needs doing. Good day.}
{341}{}{[XONG]}
{350}{}{Dr. Sheng was escorted a day or so to the south. He took up residence in some abandoned home, if I'm not mistaken. He was only supposed to be gone for a month, but it's been much longer and we have yet to hear from him. If I were to guess, I would say he was either destroyed by his own creations, or else fell victim to the numerous hazards of the wasteland.}
{351}{}{One of your lead scientists could be dead, and you don't care? You're not even going to go look into it?}
{352}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{353}{}{Well, that's that. Let me ask you something else.}
{360}{}{You'll have to excuse me for seeming so callous about the matter. The truth is, Dr. Sheng was not very popular around here and I do not believe any of us miss him in the slightest.}
{361}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{362}{}{I see. Let me ask you something else.}
{370}{}{I suppose I could... I must admit I am somewhat curious to learn of his fate. Here, I'll mark Dr. Sheng's last known location on your mapping device. But I must warn you that it could prove to be highly dangerous. Of course, it is always dangerous out there in the wastes. Anyway, if you find something of interest, do let me know.}
{371}{}{Thanks, I'll do that. Bye.}
{372}{}{Đ? tôi h?i chuy?n khác.}
{380}{}{Dr. Sheng is still alive and he's created some kind of plant that takes root in and controls human corpses.}
{390}{}{So he has achieved some success with his Xeno Project. How fascinating ... and disturbing. We put an end to his sentient plant experiments here after we lost one our techs. When he left to continue his research, I assumed he'd fall victim to his own creations. Has he managed to assume some form of control over them?}
{391}{}{Yeah, some of them seem to be subservient. They even refer to him as 'master.'}
{400}{}{Hmm... If he were to somehow establish an army of those plant-creatures, that would not bode well for the Shi. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but it seems we have no choice but to ensure that Dr. Sheng and his experiments are eliminated. Since he trusts you enough to allow you get close to him, you are the best candidate. Is that something you'd be willing to do? You would be compensated, of course.}
{401}{}{It'd be a pleasure. The guy and his whole operation creeps me out.}
{402}{}{What kind of compensation are we talking here?}
{403}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem--you guys can deal with him.}
{410}{}{The Shi will be most grateful for this service. Once Dr. Sheng and all of his creations have been eliminated, report back to me to receive your reward.}
{411}{}{[XONG]}
{420}{}{I'll leave that up to you. We could grant you weapons, supplies, or money. You may decide once the task is complete.}
{421}{}{All right. I'll do it.}
{422}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem--you guys can deal with him.}
{423}{}{All right. I'll do it. But before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{430}{}{Fair enough. We will handle the problem ourselves, but it will have to wait, as we don't have the resources to expend at the moment. Hopefully it won't be too late once we are able to act. In the meantime, if you should change your mind, please let me know.}
{431}{}{Don't count on it. Bye.}
{432}{}{I'll think about it. Bye.}
{433}{}{We'll see. Let me ask you something else.}
{440}{}{I don't suppose you have changed your mind? Will you help us eliminate Dr. Sheng and his creations?}
{441}{}{Nope, I actually wanted to ask you about something else.}
{442}{}{Alright, I'll take him out for you.}
{443}{}{I'll do it, but for a price. You were talking about compensation before?}
{450}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind... Anyway, you may claim your reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{451}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind... Anyway, we never asked you to get so involved, but we are grateful. For your troubles, you may claim a reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{452}{}{I'll take weapons.}
{453}{}{I could always use more supplies.}
{454}{}{Just give me money.}
{455}{}{Keep your reward. I only did it because it was the right thing to do.}
{460}{}{Here you go. [He hands you various high powered weapons]}
{461}{}{[XONG]}
{470}{}{Here you go. [He hands you various supplies]}
{471}{}{[XONG]}
{480}{}{Here you go. [He hands you $5,000]}
{481}{}{[XONG]}
{490}{}{The Shi appreciates your assistance. Now, I have much work to do. Good day.}
{491}{}{[XONG]}
{500}{}{Before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{501}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{502}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to give you this plant sample as a gift, but I thought I should warn you that it's infused with his sentience serum. I don't know what it's supposed to do, but I'm pretty sure it won't be good for the Shi.}
{510}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. Now if there is nothing else, I should be getting back to work.}
{511}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. But I thought you were going to eliminate Dr. Sheng, not be his courier? In any case, I should be getting back to work.}
{512}{}{Actually, I would like to ask you something else.}
{513}{}{Goodbye.}
{514}{}{Actually, I went through quite a bit of trouble to get that sample for you. I think it's worth a reward.}
{520}{}{Do you, now? The Shi did not solicit this plant sample from you, but if you feel your deeds have earned some compensation, I suppose we could spare this. [He hands you a super stimpak.] Now I really should be getting back to work.}
{521}{}{Actually, I would like to ask you something else.}
{522}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{523}{}{Really? You call this a reward? I'm gonna knock you around until something more valuable falls out.}
{530}{}{[Takes the seed.] Thank you, I will dispose of this immediately. [He sighs.] I knew Dr. Sheng had lost it, but I didn't think he'd go so far as to try and destroy his own people. He must be dealt with immediately.}
{531}{}{I agree. He's quite the madman.}
{540}{}{*clutches heart* Wahh.}
{541}{}{Urgh.}
{542}{}{Dr. Wong!}
{600}{}{You eliminate Dr. Sheng for the Shi.}
{601}{}{You deliver the plant sample to Dr. Wong.}
{602}{}{You assassinate Dr. Wong.}
