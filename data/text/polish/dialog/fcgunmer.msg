{127}{}{No, actually, I wanted to know the history. I'll go find Fung. See you.}

{140}{}{Dziêki.}
{141}{}{There is a gang of vagrants who have moved onto the Poseidon Oil tanker on the wharf. There were monsters living inside it, but the vagrants have sealed them into the lower hull. Though they are outsiders, we are grateful to the drifters for this task.}
