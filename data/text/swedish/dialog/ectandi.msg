{100}{}{You see... Tandi.}
{101}{}{You see a cute, raven-haired girl with a winsome expression. She is gazing dreamily into the
 distance.}
{102}{}{You see Tandi. She is gazing dreamily into the distance.}
{103}{}{You see Tandi. She is gazing dreamily into the distance.}
{104}{}{Hi! So you're a descendent of the Fallout 1 hero? Wow! I'm Tandi! Hi!}
{105}{}{I didn't want to just blurt it out, but your grandfather sure was cute! *Sigh*}
{106}{}{Ian? I think he's still in Fallout 2 somewhere. Vault City, maybe?}
{107}{}{Actually, I hear *I'm* in Fallout 2 somewhere. I don't want to go find me, though... might creep
 us both out.}
{108}{}{Sorry I didn't have better combat skills in Fallout 1. I guess I didn't get out much.}
{109}{}{Say... do you and Tycho still keep in touch?}
{110}{}{So there was this bug when you rescued me from the raiders and brought me back to Dad, he'd go
 ballistic. Gosh, that sucked!}
{111}{}{I'd join you, but I'm waiting for my Dad, Aradesh, to show up. He was supposed to join me a few
 revisions ago.}
