{100}{}{You see a stocky man with a submachine gun slung under his arm.}
{101}{}{It's the slave overseer.}
{102}{}{Well, from his tattoo you know he's a slaver. Looks like he's in charge of the guards around here.}
{103}{}{What the hell are you? Some kind of burglar?}
{104}{}{NCR meddling do-gooder! I got a cure for you.}
{105}{}{Vortis, we've got an intruder!}
{106}{}{Guards! Alert!}
{107}{}{What do you want?}
{108}{}{Kurg?}
{109}{}{Vad är det här för ställe?}
{110}{}{The Rangers sent me.}
{111}{}{I'm looking for the owner.}
{112}{}{Brother slaver, I've got a few questions.}
{113}{}{Sorry, wrong guy.}
{114}{}{Go on, get out of here. I've already got enough idiot guards!}
{115}{}{What are you chump, blind? This is a slave pen. You want to know more, talk to Vortis.}
{116}{}{Is that so? Well, I'm sending you back in a body bag.}
{117}{}{That'd be Vortis, the old guy.}
{118}{}{Thanks. Say, you seem like a bright guy. I'll bet you can help me out with a few questions.}
{119}{}{The old guy, eh? Okay.}
{120}{}{Well now, you put it that way, I can't really say no. What's on your mind?}
{121}{}{Thanks, stranger.}
{122}{}{I know more than old Vortis gives me credit for, you know.}
{123}{}{Well, I've done a lot more than most people suspect. Like this job, though. It's nice and cushy.}
{124}{}{Hur som helst.}
{125}{}{What's the deal with these Rangers I hear about?}
{126}{}{I'm looking for Vault 13. Ever hear of it?}
{127}{}{Ever hear of a GECK?}
{128}{}{Know anything about an outfit called the Enclave?}
{129}{}{I'm looking for work. Know anybody who's hiring?}
{130}{}{Forget it. I don't want to take up your time.}
{131}{}{Those bastards killed my brother and then said it was for the good of the people! I want them dead. If you can help, talk to Vortis.}
{132}{}{Jag tycker att det låter som en bra idé.}
{133}{}{Vortis, eh? You're a fountain of wisdom. What else do you know?}
{134}{}{Right. Think I'll do that right now.}
{135}{}{Everybody's heard of Vault 13. When I was a kid, me and my friends used to go prospecting for it. Supposed to be east of here, so we searched everything but never did find it.}
{136}{}{I'm sure you tried hard. I'd like to ask some more questions, since you know so much.}
{137}{}{Well, I got to go.}
{138}{}{GECK, eh? Back when I was studying Vault tech, I read about those. Supposedly every vault got one and it was supposed to be the first thing used once a vault got opened. They say that's how Shady Sands got its start - from a GECK. That help at all?}
{139}{}{You studied vault tech? Impressive. Say, I got some more questions for you.}
{140}{}{Well, I got to go.}
{141}{}{The Enclave.... You know, there's a doc in town, goes by the name of Henry. One night when he was drunk he started going on about some guys he called the Enclave.}
{142}{}{That's just what I needed to know. You are a well-informed man.}
{143}{}{That's all I need bother you with. Thanks.}
{144}{}{Me, I'm always on the lookout - problem is, nobody ever wants to hire a slaver anymore. Vortis, my boss, has got something hush-hush. And in town the ranchers at the Stockman's Association are always hiring plus Dorothy can always use a hand at the power plant if you got skills. Word is even President Tandi's looking for a specialist.}
{145}{}{Man, you know a lot. I could spend all day asking you questions.}
{146}{}{Well, I'll get right on these leads.}
{147}{}{You cut their... you knows... off for me, okay?}
{148}{}{No problem. There's some other stuff I'd like to know, though.}
{149}{}{I'll take care of them, don't worry.}
