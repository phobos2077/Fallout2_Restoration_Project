{100}{}{You see a man dressed in armor. He looks at you speculatively.}
{101}{}{You see Stanwell, the caravan master for the Redding-NCR run.}
{102}{}{You see a tall, muscular man in armor. His gear looks worn but well maintained.}
{103}{}{The NCR doesn't take kindly to quitters. Get out of here.}
{104}{}{You know what I think about your kind. Just get out of my sight.}
{105}{}{Hee-yah! Head 'em out.}
{106}{}{Okay, let's go.}
{107}{}{I'm Stanwell. I run the caravan between Redding and the New California Republic. Brahmin for
 gold. We could use an extra guard, and we're ready to leave right now. }
{108}{}{People call me Stanwell. I run the caravan between Redding and the New California Republic.
 Brahmin for gold. Can usually use an extra hand or two. We leave town on the 11th day of every month.
 If you want to sign on, make sure you're here then.}
{109}{}{Something else?}
{110}{}{Moo-moos?}
{111}{}{You need a guard, huh?}
{112}{}{What does this caravan transport?}
{113}{}{Why are you waiting until the 11th?}
{114}{}{I don't think that's for me. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{Damn. I hate it when that happens.}
{116}{}{Same job. Different day.}
{117}{}{Nothing's ever easy.}
{118}{}{Where's a Ranger when you need one?}
{119}{}{Every damn trip these days.}
{120}{}{You're the worst excuse for a guard I've ever seen. You couldn't keep your word if your life
 depended on it.}
{121}{}{Get the hell out of here. You should know better.}
{122}{}{Did you really think that I'd reward a thief? You're lucky I didn't lynch you on the trail.
 I'm certainly not paying you anything. Now get out.}
{123}{}{A thief? I resemble that remark, you damn ingrate. I'm leaving. Goodbye.}
{124}{}{Someday soon, you'll regret crossing me. Goodbye.}
{125}{}{We got so torn up out there that I don't have enough money to pay you. Of course, if you'd done
 your job better, things would be different.}
{126}{}{You cheap bastard! You'll pay for stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{127}{}{Well, sometimes you just get luckier than others. This was one of the unlucky times. Goodbye.}
{128}{}{We didn't quite lose everything we had... but we lost more than I can afford. If you'd done your
 job right, you'd be getting more than this $500.}
{129}{}{Well, something is better than nothing, I guess. Goodbye.}
{130}{}{You lousy bastard! Nobody could have done a better job. You'll regret stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{131}{}{That wasn't too bad at all. Here's your $2000. Come on back if you need more work sometime.}
{132}{}{I don't think I ever want to spend so much time looking at the ass-end of a brahmin again. Goodbye.}
{133}{}{That wasn't too bad at all. See you later. Goodbye.}
{134}{}{That was a good run. Might not have worked out that way if you weren't along. Here's your $2000,
 plus a $500 bonus for the great job. Thanks again.}
{135}{}{Nice to find someone who appreciates quality when he sees it. See you around, maybe. Goodbye.}
{136}{}{Always glad to make some extra money. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{137}{}{I can't leave until we get a full load of ore. It'll all be ready to move on the 11th. Early in
 the day is best. Stop back then if you want a job.}
{138}{}{We need to get the brahmin in from the outlying settlements before we can get going. We'll be
 ready to move early on the 11th. Stop back on then if you want a job.}
{139}{}{What did you say you usually transport?}
{140}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{141}{}{Thanks, I'll do that. Goodbye}
{142}{}{We're usually looking for caravan guards but, like I said, we won't be ready to go until the 11th
 of the month. If you still want a job with us, come back then.}
{143}{}{When on the 11th?}
{144}{}{What does this caravan transport?}
{145}{}{Okay, thanks. Goodbye.}
{146}{}{Sorry, pal, we've already got enough throwbacks working in this caravan.}
{147}{}{Oh, okay.}
{148}{}{We trade NCR's best brahmin for gold ore in Redding. Straight and simple - just the way I like
 things.}
{149}{}{Gotcha. You said you're looking for guards?}
{150}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{151}{}{Oh, okay. Goodbye.}
{152}{}{You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $2000, but I'm only
 paying you for the job since I only need one more guard. Ready to join us?}
{153}{}{You came along at a good time. We're ready to go right now. The job pays $2000. Ready to join us?}
{154}{}{Sounds great. I'm ready. Let's go.}
{155}{}{I can come up with better ways to spend my time than eating brahmin dust all day. Goodbye.}
{156}{}{Well, you got free eats and a safe trip here. Now get out of here, you moron.}
{157}{}{Gerg? Bye bye.}
{158}{}{Grrrr! Me want blood!}
