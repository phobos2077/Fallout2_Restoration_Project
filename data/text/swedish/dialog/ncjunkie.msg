{257}{}{I know Fallout 2 isn't a 3D game, but it still should support my brand new GeForce card.}
{258}{}{You looking at me?! You looking at me?!! I'll kill you!}
{270}{}{Uh, I'd cheer your victory over the Enclave, but my head is pounding too much. Come back at night.}
{271}{}{::Tries to clap, keeps missing::}
{272}{}{Way to go. I was too high to see what you did, but I'm sure it was cool.}
{273}{}{Uh... thanks for saving us. You, uh, got some extra chips to spare?}
{274}{}{I saved the world once, too. I think. Maybe I was high.}
{275}{}{Did the Enclave have any Jet?}
{276}{}{Are you the one who caused that big boom down south? It made my head hurt.}
{277}{}{I know you saved the world, but it's us minor NPCs that have to deal with the consequences.}
{278}{}{Chris Avellone designed me, Tom French scripted me, so technically, I'm not responsible for
 my Jet addiction.}
{279}{}{Yeah, yeah, it's great you solved the game. Of course, that means you'll be deleting all of
 us from your hard drive soon. Thanks a lot.}
{291}{}{You are the best... uh, something. You are the best SOMETHING!}
{292}{}{, you are better than JET!}
{293}{}{Man, I wish I coulda seen that exploshun while I was high. Musta been somethin', huh?}

{296}{}{Kick ASS, }
{297}{}{I know you saved the world, but it's us minor NPCs that have to deal with the consequences.}
{298}{}{You should play the game again as a drug-based character. Really! Take the Drug Reliant Trait!
 I LOVE that one.}
{299}{}{Thanks for saving us. I'd kiss you if I didn't have puke breath.}
{300}{}{I could have defeated the Enclave myself if I'd taken enough Jet.}
{301}{}{[Sings.] "We don't need another hero, we don't need to know the way home..."}
{302}{}{Chris Avellone designed me, Tom French scripted me, so technically, I'm not responsible for
 my Jet addiction.}
{303}{}{Let's take some Jet together and celebrate your victory. You're buying.}
{304}{}{Once you delete this game from your hard drive, will we exist?}
{305}{}{Uh... what kind of drug testing was the Enclave doing? Was there free Jet?}
{320}{}{How do you go to the bathroom with that thing on?}
{321}{}{Uh... are you talking ta me?}
{322}{}{Oh man, these DTs must be getting worse. Now metallic people are talking to me.}
{323}{}{Did somebody pour metal on you?}
