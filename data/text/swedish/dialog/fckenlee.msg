{100}{}{You see a stocky Shi man who looks like he's full of knowledge.}
{101}{}{You see Ken Lee, advisor to the Emperor.}
{102}{}{You see a stocky Shi man wearing glasses and a half-smile.}
{103}{}{What would you like, friend?}
{104}{}{What do you want?}
{105}{}{What can I do for you?}
{106}{}{You?}
{107}{}{Who are you?}
{108}{}{Vad är det här för ställe?}
{109}{}{I'm looking for some lost villagers.}
{110}{}{I am in need of fuel.}
{111}{}{I would like to speak to the Emperor.}
{112}{}{The Hubologists have assigned me to kill the Emperor.}
{113}{}{Nothing. Thanks. Bye.}
{114}{}{I am Ken Lee, advisor to the Emperor. And you, my friend, appear to be simpleminded, so remember this: if you seek the Enclave, then you must take the Poseidon tanker to it. You'll need fuel for the tanker. You have my blessing.}
{115}{}{Tanks!}
{116}{}{I am Ken Lee. I am the advisor to the Emperor. The Emperor advises me not to talk to you, and so I will not. Good day, fool.}
{117}{}{Grrr!}
{118}{}{Ahh, traveler, I cannot help you. Perhaps you can find the answer to your quest in another way. Good day.}
{119}{}{Dood day!}
{120}{}{I am Ken Lee. I am the advisor to the Emperor of the Shi. I bring forth the wisdom of the Emperor. And who are you?}
{121}{}{I'd like to see the Emperor.}
{122}{}{I am}
{123}{}{You sound like an overgrown flunky to me.}
{124}{}{No one important. Goodbye.}
{125}{}{This is the Steel Palace of the Emperor. This is the heart of Shi-town.}
{126}{}{And where is the Emperor?}
{127}{}{What sort of research do you do here?}
{128}{}{What's the history of the place?}
{129}{}{I see. So long.}
{130}{}{If you wish to see the Emperor then you must give me your own name.}
{131}{}{Oh. Right. I'm}
{132}{}{Sure. My name is}
{133}{}{Ja.}
{134}{}{Glöm det.}
{135}{}{Not everyone is granted a chance to see the Emperor. You must first prove your worth. Are you willing to prove yours?}
{136}{}{Ja.}
{137}{}{No. I've had enough tests in the last several months to last me a lifetime.}
{138}{}{I do not believe the Emperor would like to see you. I have been told to forbid entrance to those who offend me or who reek of evil. You do both, traveler. Good day.}
{139}{}{[KLAR]}
{140}{}{Insults will get you nowhere, traveler, except removed from the Steel Palace. Kindly control your tongue.}
{141}{}{Make me.}
{142}{}{Bra.}
{143}{}{The Emperor remains hidden from prying eyes. As my job is to act as the Emperor's screen, I cannot and will not tell you where he is.}
{144}{}{I have more questions.}
{145}{}{Hej då.}
{146}{}{We do research that will change the world. For more answers to your questions, you should seek out Dr. Wong Yi Tze. }
{147}{}{I will. And I have more questions.}
{148}{}{I will. Bye.}
{149}{}{We were the survivors from the wreck of a submarine. When we ran aground, we stripped the metal from the submarine to create the Palace. Some do not believe this.}
{150}{}{Hm. It sounds almost as if you're berating someone.}
{151}{}{I see. Thanks. Bye.}
{152}{}{Ah, yes! I have seen some of your movies. Yet surely this is not your real name?}
{153}{}{Sure it is.}
{154}{}{No. My real name is}
{155}{}{It's all the name you need, old man.}
{156}{}{That will be quite impossible. Good day.}
{157}{}{[KLAR]}
{158}{}{Surely you must give me more credit than that. I know how the "biz" works. I have traveled to New Reno before.}
{159}{}{Okay, my name is}
{160}{}{That's my real name! Now let me talk to the Emperor!}
{161}{}{Excellent. This is what I require of you: there is a small military base north of here, called Navarro. There are numerous vertibirds there. We need plans and blueprints to manufacture some of our own. Fetch those and you will be on your way to seeing the Emperor.}
{162}{}{Ska ske.}
{163}{}{Glöm det.}
{164}{}{Will you reconsider taking our test?}
{165}{}{Nepp.}
{166}{}{Oh, all right. I'll do it.}
{167}{}{Lost villagers? I have heard nothing of this. Perhaps the Emperor would know of them.}
{168}{}{I have more questions.}
{169}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{170}{}{You must complete a second test: the Hubologists are our enemies. Their leader, AHS-9, has been abducting and brainwashing our children. Kill him for the good of the Shi and I shall tell you how to speak to the Emperor.}
{171}{}{He's as good as dead.}
{172}{}{No, I don't think so.}
{173}{}{No? It saddens me, but I understand. Best of luck in your quest. If you change your mind, you know where to reach me.}
{174}{}{Sure do. I have more questions.}
{175}{}{Yep. Bye.}
{176}{}{I am anxious to see the result of your attempt. Good day.}
{177}{}{Good day.}
{178}{}{Berating someone? Any fool who had done their research can see that the very basis of Shi-town is the wreckage of this submarine. It seems fruitless to argue with those who would say otherwise.}
{179}{}{That's very even-tempered of you.}
{180}{}{It certainly is. And I deal with these people on a daily basis. Alas!}
{181}{}{Well, I have more questions.}
{182}{}{Yeah, poor you. Bye.}
{183}{}{Du är verkligen en värdig mottagare av vårt bränsle. Jag tror att jag kan lita på dig när det gäller våra hemligheter. I det bakre rummet kommer du att se att kraftfältet till den stora datorn har stängts av. Skriv in lösenordet "CSPDMSHR-Shih-huang-ti-X9372" och du kommer att finna dig själv ansluten till Kejsardatorn. Kejsaren kommer att kunna styra vårt bränsle dit du behöver det.}
{184}{}{Tack.}
{185}{}{Guards! The enemy is among us! Guards!}
{186}{}{Have they really? Perhaps you would like to turn the tables on them? I can promise you our aid if you will agree to kill AHS-9. }
{187}{}{He's as good as dead.}
{188}{}{Nej.}
{189}{}{Excellent. I hope to hear of your success soon.}
{190}{}{You will. I have more questions.}
{191}{}{You will. Bye.}
{192}{}{Then in that case, you can only be an enemy. Good day.}
{193}{}{Good day.}
{194}{}{With the death of AHS-9, the Great and Terrible, the Hubologists pose no real threat to us and our researches. Well done. You have our gratitude. Would you like to speak to the Emperor?}
{195}{}{Ja.}
{196}{}{Not right now. I have other questions, though.}
{197}{}{Du har visat att du är en vän till Shi. Jag tror att jag kan lita på dig när det gäller våra hemligheter. I det bakre rummet kommer du att finna att kraftfältet till den stora datorn har stängts av. Skriv in lösenordet "CSPDMSHR-Shih-huang-ti-X9372" och du kommer att finna dig själv ansluten till kejsardatorn. Jag hoppas att detta kommer att vara till nytta för dig.}
{198}{}{The Emperor is a COMPUTER?}
{199}{}{Got it. Thanks.}
{200}{}{Yes. It stores our history, our research, and projects possibilities for the future. It is far better than any fallible human- yet we temper its suggestions with our own knowledge of human nature.}
{201}{}{I ... see. Well, thanks for your time.}
{202}{}{Our spies report that you have given the vertibird plans to the Hubologists. Steal them for us and you shall be rewarded.}
{203}{}{You got it. I have some questions.}
{204}{}{No way.}
{205}{}{Thank you for the vertibird plans, traveler. What can I do for you?}
{206}{}{I have questions.}
{207}{}{Um... Nothing.}
{208}{}{Once you have obtained the vertibird plans, give them to Dr. Wong Yi Tze. He will put them to good use.}
{209}{}{Okay. I have other questions.}
{210}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{211}{}{. I'd like to see the Emperor.}
{212}{}{.}
{213}{}{Remember, you must take the plans to Dr. Wong Yi Tze.}
{214}{}{You are back to insult me again. I think not.}
{215}{}{As I have explained, I will need to know your name.}
{216}{}{All right, it's}
{217}{}{Forget it, you idiot!}
{218}{}{Remember, the Emperor awaits the death of AHS-9.}
{219}{}{I am sorry. But I cannot offer what fuel we have to you. Perhaps if you were to speak to the Emperor?}
{220}{}{How do I do that?}
{221}{}{Can I just ask another question?}
{222}{}{I wish I were able to offer you our fuel, but unfortunately our stores are empty. They have been diverted by some means to the Hubologists. It is possible that you would be able to find someone to divert it back.}
{223}{}{Can I see the Emperor now?}
{224}{}{I respectfully remind you that unless you have given the vertibird plans to Dr. Wong Yi Tze, I cannot grant you access to the Emperor. I hope you understand.}
{500}{}{Leave immediately, or I will call the guards.}
{501}{}{Leave now. This is your second warning.}
{502}{}{This is your last warning.}
{503}{}{Guards!}
{1430}{}{Kejsaren förblir dold för nyfikna ögon. Det är mitt jobb att agera som kejsarens skärm. Du har dock visat dig vara en vän till Shi. Jag tror att jag kan lita på dig när det gäller våra hemligheter. I det bakre rummet kommer du att finna att kraftfältet till den stora datorn har stängts av. Ange lösenordet "CSPDMSHR-Shih-huang-ti-X9372" och du kommer att finna dig själv ansluten till kejsardatorn. Jag hoppas att detta kommer att vara till nytta för dig.}
{2001}{}{I ... see. Well, thanks for your time. I have a village to rescue.}
