{210}{}{Get lost, stupid.}
{220}{}{(The man doesn't even glance up as you approach him. He is staring at the wall behind the bar.)}
{221}{}{Uh, hey, heard any good rumors?}
{222}{}{Hey, what do you think of these new glasses I'm wearing?}

{230}{}{What kind of an asshole question is that?}
{231}{}{Whoa. Back up. Just curious.}
{232}{}{Okay, well never mind then.}
{240}{}{Back up yerself.}
{241}{}{Not before I beat the living crap out of you.}
{250}{}{(The man turns his glare on you.) You look like an idiot.}
{251}{}{Whoa. Back up. I was just asking for your opinion.}
{252}{}{Uh... thanks for the honesty, then.}
{260}{}{(Gestures for you to shut up and let him drink.)}
{261}{}{(Leave him alone.)}
