{100}{}{You see a tribesman.}
{101}{}{You see a tribeswoman.}
{150}{}{Before you stands a large warrior of your village, wearing
 pants fashioned from animal hides.}
{151}{}{[TALA]}
{152}{}{Hello, Chosen One, can I help you in your quest?}
{153}{}{I'm just looking around the village one last time before I leave.}
{154}{}{What can you tell me of the traders who trade with us?}
{155}{}{Could you tell me where I can find more healing powder?}
{156}{}{Gods give you speed to bring back Eden before it is too late.}
{157}{}{I do have a question for you.}
{158}{}{Goodbye, my friend.}
{159}{}{Oh, you're testing me. Go see Hakunin in the northern corner of the village. He makes our
 medicines.}
{160}{}{Tack. Hej då.}
{161}{}{Well, I've seen them when Mynoc has us guard the bridge, but he does all the dealing.
 Talk to him at the Great Bridge.}
{162}{}{Tack. Hej då.}
{163}{}{Could tell me where the Great Bridge is located?}
{164}{}{One more question, if I may.}
{165}{}{Chosen One? The Great Bridge is at the southern end of the village. You know,
 you've been there many times.}
{166}{}{Tack. Hej då.}
{167}{}{One more question, if I may.}
{168}{}{Of course, what is it?}
{169}{}{Could you tell me where I can find some healing herbs?}
{170}{}{What can you tell me of the traders who trade with us?}
{171}{}{Never mind.}
{172}{}{Ah, dull one. They say you are the Chosen One. I must say the spirit
 of the Founder works in strange ways.}
{173}{}{Oon Ga.}
{174}{}{ Have a safe journey, dull one -- for our sake.}
{175}{}{????}
{176}{}{You betray us. You must die.}
{177}{}{A traitor to your own people!}
{178}{}{Why do you do this?}
{179}{}{Death to the evil one!}
{180}{}{They are nothing to us! They scavenge the dying corpse
 of the wastes to live.}
{181}{}{Could you tell me where I can find some healing herbs?}
{182}{}{Tack. Hej då.}
{183}{}{One more question, if I may.}
{300}{}{Hello again, Chosen One. May the warrior spirits protect and guide you.}
{301}{}{Are you having difficulties, Chosen One? You must not fail us - please hurry.}
{302}{}{Why do you wait so long? We must have the GECK soon. Chosen One, our village is dying.}
{303}{}{Chosen One, our village is almost dead. Why have you not brought the holy GECK to us yet?}
{970}{}{That is my name.}
{971}{}{You are talking to me.}
{972}{}{What a silly question. That's me.}
{980}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{981}{}{Sorry. No clue.}
{982}{}{Never heard of it.}

{1010}{}{Bro}
{1011}{}{Mynoc}
{1100}{}{The Elder is your mother and our leader.}
{1101}{}{Our great ancestor who gave us knowledge.}
{1102}{}{The first to fight and win over chaos.}
{1103}{}{That would be our beautiful village.}
{1104}{}{That's a trading outpost a few days east of here.}
{1105}{}{The Vault is heaven.}
{1106}{}{You are the Chosen One.}
{1107}{}{He heals us with his herbs and magic. He is in the northern
 part of our village.}
{1108}{}{He heals us with his herbs and magic. He is in the northern
 part of our village.}
{1109}{}{It is a magic powder which will heal you, but will make
 you sleepy.}
{1110}{}{The Great Bridge exits our village in the south.}
{1111}{}{He guards the bridge leading into our village.}
