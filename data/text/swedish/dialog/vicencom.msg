{183}{}{Shamble off}

{187}{}{You pry open the panel beneath the machine and search for a voice recognition module. You don't
 see one... the circuit boards in this computer look much different than the ones in the Vault 13
 computer.}
{188}{}{Replace the panel and look through the computer archives.}
{189}{}{It was worth a shot. Better go look somewhere else.}
{190}{}{As you replace the panel, however, you suddenly notice a small picture of the Pip-Boy located

{192}{}{Leave the terminal.}

 Pip-Boy little person.}

 grinding, beeping, and mantis-chirping. Eventually, there is a beep, and your Pip-Boy slides out.}
{199}{}{Take your Pip-Boy and leave.}

 entitled "Classified." It looks like your skill points in Science are paying off.}
{304}{}{[Read entry.]}
{305}{}{Reading through the file, it appears as if the sole purpose of Vault 8 was to act as a "control Vault" in a series of Vaults created by a corporation called Vault-Tec.
 The intent was for Vault 8 to open and re-colonize the surface after 10 years. It also appears Vault 8 was not the only Vault with a purpose other than protecting its inhabitants from the Great War.
 Perhaps more can be found out about the true purpose of these Vaults at another location.}
