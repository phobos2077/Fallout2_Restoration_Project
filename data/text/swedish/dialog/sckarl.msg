{100}{}{You see a young man wearing the badge of the NCR police.}
{101}{}{It's Karl, the town deputy.}
{102}{}{You see a young man barely out of his teens. He looks eager to please.}
{103}{}{Welcome, stranger. I'm Deputy Karl. What can I do for you?}
{104}{}{Such as?}
{105}{}{Uh... nugh..}
{106}{}{I'm new to NCR. What can you tell me about your town?}
{107}{}{Well, I'm looking for Vault 13.}
{108}{}{President Tandi sent me over to talk to some prisoner you've got.}
{109}{}{My name's}
{110}{}{I'm looking for a guy named Jack. Some folks call him Whack Jack.}
{111}{}{Where can I find Roger Westin?}
{112}{}{Okay, had a little too much party did you? Look, there's an unlocked cell back there. Why don't you go in back and sleep it off?}
{113}{}{Look, take my advice - get your friends to take you home so you can sleep it off. Drunk in public's a crime here.}
{114}{}{This is NCR, capitol of the New California Republic. Population 3000 and growing. No slavery, no gambling, no drugs. President is Mrs. Tandi, my boss is Sheriff Dumont. That answer your questions?}
{115}{}{Well, I've got some other questions.}
{116}{}{Yeah, that's all.}
{117}{}{So did I when I was a kid. Let me know if you find it!}
{118}{}{Well, I've got some other questions.}
{119}{}{Gee, thanks.}
{120}{}{His name's Oswald. That's all we could get out of him. He's supposed to be a squatter, from vault 15, but... I doubt it. He's a bit too tough. You know what I mean?}
{121}{}{Tough guy, huh?}
{122}{}{What're you going to do to him?}
{123}{}{Say, I've heard of you haven't I? Yeah - some pretty good stuff. Look, there's some folks I know, they could use a fellow like you. Just go to the auto shop and ask for Elise. Tell her Karl sends his regards.}
{124}{}{Work? The Stockman's Association is looking for guards. Raiders been hitting the cattle drives hard again. And I heard that President Tandi's been looking for somebody "resourceful," as she puts it. That help?}
{125}{}{Well, I've got some other questions.}
{126}{}{Some. Thanks.}
{127}{}{That's Officer Jack, stranger. One of our men. You haven't been talking to Mira, have you?}
{128}{}{Ja.}
{129}{}{Mira who?}
{130}{}{That SOB? He's got a spread just outside town. Just take the road past Stockman's.}
{131}{}{You don't like him much.}
{132}{}{Well, I've got some other questions.}
{133}{}{Tack.}
{134}{}{Yeah. He's a real bad one. Killed two of our men and hasn't said a thing.}
{135}{}{Give me a little time alone with him. Maybe I can convince him to be cooperative.}
{136}{}{Can I see him now?}
{137}{}{Hang the bastard, I hope. Him and his buddies killed two good men. Won't be any pain for me to see him dead.}
{138}{}{Can I see him now?}
{139}{}{She and Jack used to be married, you know. Had themselves a really messy divorce. I wouldn't believe spit from her, not about Jack. 
Do yourself a favor, stay out of it. Jack's a good man, it's just this stuff's got him a little high-strung.}
{140}{}{Okay, let's move on to other topics.}
{141}{}{Well, thank you kindly for that advice, deputy.}
{142}{}{His ex, that's all. If he's not here, he might be over at the power plant. He's been moonlighting over there for Dorothy.}
{143}{}{Well, I've got some other questions.}
{144}{}{Tack.}
{145}{}{Guess I'm pretty obvious. Lot of folks look up to him because he's a councilman, but not me. He thinks he's a big man, like the law don't always apply to him. I'd like to take him down a notch or two someday.}
{146}{}{Stranger things have happened. What can you tell me about him?}
{147}{}{I've got to go. Just outside of town, you say?}
{148}{}{No problem. Next five minutes, maybe I won't hear a thing. Follow me.}
{149}{}{Sure, for what good it will do you.}
{150}{}{Well, a couple of years ago he had a stroke and now Doc Jubilee's got him on some kind of medicine. What's it to you, anyway?}
{151}{}{Nothing, just talk. I'll quit wasting your time.}
{152}{}{. I'm in need of some honest work.}
{153}{}{Tandi say you got bad man here.}
{154}{}{Me want to see bad man.}
