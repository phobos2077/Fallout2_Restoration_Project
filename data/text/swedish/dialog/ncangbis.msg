{100}{}{You see Angela Bishop.}
{101}{}{You see a screaming Angela Bishop.}
{150}{}{You see an attractive young woman in tight leather.}
{151}{}{You see Angela Bishop. When she catches your eye, she slowly licks her lips.}
{152}{}{You see Angela Bishop. She scowls at you with disgust.}
{175}{}{You see a young woman in tight leather. She looks too high-brow to be a whore.}
{176}{}{You see Angela Bishop. She sneers at you.}
{200}{}{My father's gonna KILL you when he hears how you treated me.}
{205}{}{I KNOW it was you. I'll find some way to get you for what you did to my father.}
{210}{}{Hmmpph. If it isn't the big heroine.}
{215}{}{You better hope you don't fall through the floor, clanky.}

{232}{}{One of Daddy's cheap sluts...}
{240}{}{Haven't seen YOU around before. What's your name, stranger? (Smirks.) Actually, never mind, I don't want to know. You as bored as I am?}

{249}{}{I might be bored. Why, you looking for some excitement, princess?}
{250}{}{Not really. I've got somewhere I've got to be.}
{260}{}{Oh, this IS going to be interesting. Come with me, I want to show you my room.}
{261}{}{'Kay pretty girl.}

{292}{}{Okee dokee. Me not want you sad. Me go}
{293}{}{ME LEAVE STOP TALKING TO ME}
{300}{}{Enough already, you stupid retard! Get out of here then! ::Idiot.::}
{310}{}{You NEW or something? I'm Angela BISHOP. My Dad is the HEAD of Family Bishop. }
{311}{}{You work for him, which means you work for ME. }
{312}{}{You better do what I say, and I say you're coming with me. Now.}
{313}{}{You're right: Your Dad IS head of Family Bishop. That's why we're not going anywhere.}
{314}{}{Well, if you're gonna pull rank and all... let's go.}
{315}{}{It's not that I'm not FLATTERED, but...}
{316}{}{No. I meant it the first time.}
{317}{}{No way, sweetheart. You run along now before you get a spanking.}
{318}{}{Let's get one thing straight, princess: I give the orders, you receive them.}
{320}{}{If you're bored, princess... squat on your hand and spin around. I'm outta here.}
{330}{}{You'll wish you hadn't turned me down. Daddy's gonna start hearing ALL sorts of things about you soon. Just you wait.}
{340}{}{Why? Am I getting a reaction out of you? (She takes a step toward you, and her voice drops.) Am I giving
 you a... HARD time?}
{341}{}{Not really.}
{342}{}{Girl, you're trouble. Let's stop this right now.}
{343}{}{Excuse me. Would you please back up a little?}
{344}{}{Yeah, it's getting pretty hard. Can you help me with that?}
{345}{}{No, but I have to be going.}
{350}{}{(Takes another step forward, almost touching you.) I don't FEEL like it. What are you going to do about it?}
{352}{}{Nothing. Look, back off. I'm not in the mood.}
{353}{}{Back off. I AIN'T in the mood for your bad-girl shit, you hear me?}
{354}{}{What are YOU going to do about it? You talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?}
{360}{}{Sure can. }
{361}{}{Look: I got some Jet in my room... and NOT that crappy shit they give the dimestore hookers and junkies. Y'wanna fly?}
{362}{}{Sure. Buckle up, baby.}
{363}{}{I'll come along for the ride.}
{364}{}{Your father know you do that shit?}
{365}{}{I changed my mind. No thanks.}
{366}{}{Naw, I just thought I'd see if you were as big a whore as I thought you were. Later, princess.}
{370}{}{You watch your mouth when you talk to me. I'm Angela BISHOP. My Dad is the HEAD of Family Bishop. You'll show me the same
 respect you show him, or they'll be scraping pieces of you off the wall. UNDERSTAND?}
{371}{}{Yeah, I understand you need someone to put in your place, PRINCESS, and I'm just the man to do it.}
{372}{}{Understood. Glad we got that family association thing cleared up.}
{373}{}{Calm down. I was just joking with you.}
{374}{}{Forget this.}
{375}{}{Forget this shit. I'm outta here.}
{380}{}{Why you arrogant son of a -- I ought to go tell Daddy right now what you said to me.}
{381}{}{Why don't you, then? I ain't stopping you, princess.}
{382}{}{I don't think you will. I think you want to see what kind of man I am.}
{383}{}{Let's stop this right now before someone gets hurt.}
{384}{}{Yeah, why don't you go do that? I got better things to do.}
{385}{}{Forget this sixth-grade bullshit. I'm outta here.}
{390}{}{You... you aren't worth my TIME.}
{391}{}{And you aren't worth mine, you spoiled brat.}
{392}{}{Honey, you couldn't AFFORD my time.}
{393}{}{Feeling's mutual.}
{394}{}{Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm outta here.}
{400}{}{Oh, really? What kind of man are you? You gonna SHOW me?}
{401}{}{Yeah. Let's go to your room, princess, and I'll show you what a real man is.}
{402}{}{Naw, I was just curious to see how much of a slut you really are. Later, baby.}
{410}{}{Yeah, it's best you know how things stand around here. (Looks you up and down.)}
{411}{}{Eh...}
{413}{}{[Stand there uncomfortably while she checks you out.]}
{420}{}{All right then... (Looks you up and down.)}
{422}{}{Okay, so...}
{430}{}{(Shrugs.) He doesn't care. (Frowns.) Look, you wanna come fly with me or what?}
{432}{}{All right, then. Let's go to your room.}
{433}{}{Look, can't we just be friends?}
{434}{}{No, I better be going.}
{435}{}{Naw. If I wanted a bitch, I'd go get a dog. Later.}
{440}{}{WHAT did you just say to me?}
{441}{}{Nothing. Let's go to your room.}
{442}{}{I said, "can't we just be friends?"}
{443}{}{Nothing. Look, I better be going.}
{450}{}{Hey, it's you... we had some good times before you went off and kicked the Enclave's ass. You wanna re-live some
 of those moments?}
{451}{}{You again. You want to waste some time?}
{452}{}{Inte just nu}
{453}{}{All right. Let's go to your room.}
{460}{}{I heard about what you did to the Enclave, }
{462}{}{Well, well: }
{463}{}{VERY impressive. I think you're just the person to help me with this... problem I have. }
{464}{}{Me have problems}
{465}{}{Only you ken prevent forest firez}
{466}{}{Shamble off}
{467}{}{What problem is that?}
{468}{}{No, I don't think so. I better be going.}
{469}{}{I ain't got time for this. I'm outta here.}
{480}{}{See, I have this load of premium Jet in my room, and I can't take it all by myself.}
{481}{}{Oh?}
{482}{}{And that's a problem, because...?}
{483}{}{Uh... I don't think that I'm the right pers...}
{490}{}{Haven't seen YOU around before. You one of Daddy's new whores?}
{491}{}{Hunh?}
{493}{}{No. You?}
{494}{}{No, just passing through.}
{495}{}{You must be Bishop's daughter. I work for your father, Miss Bishop.}
{496}{}{Actually, I WORK for your father. I'm one of his made men.}
{497}{}{Actually, I WORK for him as one of his enforcers.}
{499}{}{I'm not a whore, but I just finished speaking with one.}
{510}{}{Well, I can see Daddy's hiring standards haven't changed. Watch your step around here, honey, or you're gonna
 get hurt.}
{511}{}{Okayeee! Thanx!}
{520}{}{Kind of like shit through the intestines, huh? Don't stay too long, bitch, or you're gonna get hurt.}
{521}{}{Hur som helst.}
{522}{}{Bitch...}
{531}{}{Yeah, I understand you need someone to put in your place, PRINCESS, and I'm just the one to do it.}
{532}{}{Understood, Miss Bishop.}
{534}{}{I better be going.}
{535}{}{I'm outta here.}
{540}{}{I CALLED you a whore, didn't I? Not much difference between being 'made' and getting laid, right?}
{541}{}{Enforcer, whore... what's the difference?}
{542}{}{There's a big difference. Do you want me to teach it to you, you little pampered bitch?}
{543}{}{Not much difference, Miss Bishop.}
{544}{}{I'm sorry Miss Bishop, I don't have time to talk right now.}
{550}{}{You make a move toward me, and you'll be dead before you take a step.}
{551}{}{Wanna bet on it? I think you'll lose.}
{552}{}{We'll see about that. I'm outta here.}
{560}{}{You... you touch me, and Daddy'll hear about it.}
{561}{}{He won't care.}
{563}{}{Calm down. I was just joking, all right?}
{564}{}{Yeah, we'll see.}
{570}{}{He... he will so. You just see.}
{571}{}{Get out of here, you little bitch. Now.}
{573}{}{Calm down. I was just joking.}
{580}{}{(She sneers at you, then turns and stomps away.)}
{581}{}{[Walk away.]}
{590}{}{(She continues to glare at you, but she seems uncertain. She bites her lip, then walks away hurriedly.)}
{591}{}{Yeah, THOUGHT so.}
{600}{}{(She spits at your feet.) Yeah, so was I. (She gives you a final sneer, then walks away.)}
{610}{}{'Not much difference, Miss Bishop.' And I thought my Mom was Daddy's only slave. Get out of my sight.}
{620}{}{'Understood, Miss Bishop.' And I thought my Mom was Daddy's only slave. Get out of my sight.}
{630}{}{'I'm SORRY, Miss Bishop, I don't have time to talk to you right now.' And I thought my Mom was Daddy's only slave.
 Get out of my sight.}
{640}{}{Yeah, you start walking. Daddy's gonna start hearing ALL sorts of things about you soon. Just you wait. }
{641}{}{(Turns away.)}
{642}{}{You say one word to good ol' Dad, and you'll find yourself 'flying' off the top of the highest building in New Reno.
 Once they find the little note I leave, everybody'll call it a suicide. It'll be a TERRIBLE tragedy. They'll be crying in the aisles.}
{643}{}{(Leave.)}
{650}{}{No, I think that's a bet YOU'RE going to lose, bitch. Just try it.}
{651}{}{[Attack her.]}
{652}{}{[Let it go.]}
{660}{}{Stay away from me. I haven't got anything to say to you.}
{661}{}{Daddy's gonna start hearing ALL sorts of things about you soon. Just you wait.}
{670}{}{Not only that, but when I take Jet, I get all WILD, and I can barely control myself. I need someone who knows how to
 take charge to make sure I don't do anything... foolish.}
{671}{}{I'm your man. Let's do it.}
{672}{}{Sometimes being a hero means protecting beautiful young women from themselves, whatever the cost. Lead on.}
{673}{}{I think you have me confused with someone who'd actually consider touching you.}
{680}{}{You see Angela Bishop, who is currently asleep. She is snoring slightly, her hair is in disarray, and she has a bright smile on her face.}
{690}{}{You see a young woman in tight leather who is screaming her head off.}
{700}{}{Zzxxssnnn... oh, }
{701}{}{Zzzzz...}
{800}{}{Rape! Help!}
{801}{}{Help, he assaulted me! Help!}
{802}{}{Rape! Rape!}
{810}{}{(Angela leads you up to her room on the third floor. There, she opens a little door in the wall, takes out a strange
 plastic bottle, and offers it to you.) Want some, baby? There's more than enough for both of us to fly.}
{811}{}{(Angela leads you up to her room on the third floor. While there, she cracks open a safe in the wall, takes out some
 Jet, and offers some to you.) Want some, baby? There's more than enough for both of us to fly.}
{812}{}{Uh-huh}
{813}{}{Unh-unh}
{820}{}{Mmmmmmmm... (Angela takes a deep hit from the bottle.) Mmmmmmm... why don't you come over
 here? (She lies down on the bed, takes another hit.) If you hurry, you can still suck some
 of this Jet outta my mouth...}
{821}{}{Well since you put it that way... sure.}
{822}{}{No thanks. I might throw up if I inhale any of that shit... or if I stay here any longer.}
{830}{}{(Angela's eyes blaze with rage. She jumps up from the bed and starts screaming her head off!)
 Rape! Help! Rape!}
{831}{}{Shhhh! If you dont be quiet, George won't let me play with th'rabbitz! Shhhh!}
{832}{}{No scream! No scream!}
{833}{}{I am SO out of here.}
{1460}{}{. }
{1461}{}{. I saw your latest movie. }
{1462}{}{. I heard about your exploits in the ring. }
{1700}{}{, oooooh... zzxnhzzz}
{1701}{}{, again? Ooooh... }
