{100}{}{You see Keith Wright.}

{240}{}{I still can't believe Dad is dead. There's so much that I wanted to say to him...}
{250}{}{Slaver, you done come to the wrong side of town. If you don't start explain' yourself, yer gonna be
 in a whole mess of trouble.}
{251}{}{I don't know you, my Dad don't know you, and if you don't start explainin', it ain't gonna matter.}
{252}{}{How's it goin', }
{253}{}{Thanks for finding out who killed Richard, }
{254}{}{Whatdya want now?}
{255}{}{Mattah. Man is Mattah!}
{256}{}{Jabawokee Ding Dong}
{257}{}{Wander off}
{258}{}{I'm looking for a job. Is Family Wright hiring?}
{259}{}{I'm looking for a job. Chris sent me by. Is Family Wright hiring?}
{262}{}{Hey, Keith. I ran into your Mom.}
{263}{}{Can you tell me about your brother Richard?}
{264}{}{Nevermind. Sorry to bother you.}
{280}{}{Get outta here, dimbulb. Next time you talk to me, I'll plug you fulla holes.}
{281}{}{Holes holes holes in my soles}
{282}{}{Shamma Lamma DING DONG}
{290}{}{Get outta here! I ain't warning you again!}
{291}{}{A-gin, my shin, lots of din-din}
{292}{}{DING DONG! DING DONG!}
{300}{}{I warned you, dim...}
{301}{}{Hunh?}
{310}{}{I'm Keith Wright of the Family Wright. Now, you gonna tell me what yer doing here?}
{312}{}{Chris told me to stop by. I'm looking for work. Can you help me?}
{313}{}{Keith Wright, huh? I ran into your mother.}
{315}{}{What is this place?}
{325}{}{This is the Family Wright HOUSE. Now, you gonna tell me what yer doing here?}
{335}{}{Chris sent you, huh?}
{336}{}{That's right. He said you might have some work for me.}
{345}{}{I don't know if it'd do any good, but I guess I could ask Pa...}
{346}{}{If you could, I'd appreciate it.}
{355}{}{Naw... we don't hire muscle like the other families, 'least not now. }
{356}{}{Naw... we don't traffic with slaver trash like the other families. }
{357}{}{You better git.}
{358}{}{I'm not leaving until I see Mr. Wright.}
{359}{}{All right then.}
{365}{}{Naw, I reckon you WILL be leaving, 'cause you look like the kinda person who likes living. Now get.}
{366}{}{I'm NOT leaving.}
{367}{}{All right.}
{375}{}{I WARNED you...}
{376}{}{You want some of THIS, BOY?! You want some of THIS?! Then come GET s --}
{380}{}{Uh... what about her? Has she gotten herself in trouble again?}
{381}{}{No. Is that a common occurrence?}
{383}{}{No, I was just curious. Later, Keith.}
{390}{}{Sometimes. She's always preachin' and hollerin' about the evils o' drink and gamblin' and damn
 near everything else. Causes quite a stir, sometimes, and gets Dad real upset.}
{391}{}{Does your Mom have any idea what your family does?}
{392}{}{I'll bet. Well, thanks for talking with me, Keith.}
{400}{}{Naw, she don't know half of it. She thinks Dad's all clean and above the board, but she ain't too
 bright to catch on to what he's doin'. If she found that still beneath the train station, she'd raise cain, she would.}
{401}{}{I see. Thanks, Keith.}
{410}{}{(Shakes head.) She done it this time, wrecking Pa's stills n' all. The workers were too afraid
 ta stop her, and Pa threw a fit, and she threw one right back at him. (Shrugs.) It'll take Pa a while to
 get back up on his feet.}
{420}{}{Good kid. Damn, if we ever find out who done it to him...}
{421}{}{Any ideas who might've done it?}
{422}{}{Well, hopefully you'll find the killer. Bye, Keith.}
{430}{}{Lotta other families sell Jet, coulda been any one of them. Mordino's got the most Jet dealers, though,
 cause they make the most Jet. Me, I'm bettin' it was one of them.}
{431}{}{What dealers do you suspect?}
{432}{}{Can you tell me a little about Richard?}
{440}{}{Bunch of 'em: Jagged Jimmy J on 2nd Street, that old sonuvabitch Renesco in the West End... and Jules
 deals, too, at th' fronta town, but mostly to dumb tourists. Then there's Little Jesus Mordino.}
{441}{}{Little Jesus Mordino?}
{442}{}{Can you tell me a little more about Richard?}
{443}{}{Thanks for the info, Keith.}
{450}{}{Quiet kid, clean kid. Kept outta trouble, and for a Wright, that's something. We buried
 him on the Golgotha plains a while ago, but even so, Mom still don't want his room disturbed.
 It's hard for her to let go, y'know?}
{451}{}{Which room was his? Do you think your mother would mind if I looked in there?}
{452}{}{Any dealers you suspect may have given him the Jet?}
{454}{}{Buried in Golgotha, huh? Hmmm. Thanks for the info, Keith.}
{460}{}{His room? It's the empty one next to Mom's room, the second one down from the kitchen. As fer looking around... well... look, don't stay
 long... and don't mess the place up, or Mom'll pop a clip if she finds out.}
{461}{}{Thanks, Keith. I won't be long.}
{470}{}{Hold on. (Knocks on door behind him.) Pa? (He sticks his head in, there's some mumbling, then he comes back and nods at the door.)
 You ken go in, but watch out. Dad's in a pissy mood.}
{471}{}{Tack.}
{480}{}{He's Big Jesus' son. A bastard, more like. He mighta caught Richard alone, then pumped him fulla
 Jet outta spite. You looking for him, check out the Desperado. Little Jesus hangs out there with his old man.}
{1220}{}{. What's goin' on?}
{1252}{}{. Everybody treating you all right? Anything I can do for you?}
{1253}{}{. We owe you big, and the Wrights always pay their debts. What can I do for you?}
