{100}{}{You see a young woman in tattered clothing.}
{101}{}{You see Dalia.}
{102}{}{You see a young woman in tattered clothing. She seems very alert, and watches her surroundings
 carefully.}
{103}{}{Hi. I'm Dalia. What can I help you with?}
{104}{}{Nothing, just say hi.}
{105}{}{Uh, who you?}
{106}{}{What you do here?}
{107}{}{You look like guard.}
{108}{}{Jag g책 nu.}
{109}{}{Just saying hello.}
{110}{}{Who are you?}
{111}{}{What are you doing?}
{112}{}{You look like you're guarding that trail.}
{113}{}{I'll be going now.}
{114}{}{Well, hello to you. Now, I'm sorry, but you should go.}
{115}{}{Me want talk.}
{116}{}{Ok, me go.}
{117}{}{I want to talk to you.}
{118}{}{Hej d책.}
{119}{}{I said I'm Dalia. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I don't want to talk to anyone right now. Okay?}
{120}{}{Okay, bye.}
{121}{}{Just little more.}
{122}{}{Then I'll leave.}
{123}{}{I just want to ask you a question.}
{124}{}{I like the fresh air, I like the trees, so I'm standing here. Do you have a problem with that?}
{125}{}{Sorry, me go.}
{126}{}{No, not problem. Me ask you something.}
{127}{}{I don't have a problem, but I am curious about something.}
{128}{}{Sorry, I'll be going then.}
{129}{}{No, I'm not guarding the trail. There's nothing in this hole worth guarding. I told you, I'm
 enjoying the fresh air. Now go away.}
{130}{}{You nice talk to. Me talk more.}
{131}{}{Sorry me bother. Me go.}
{132}{}{But we're having such a nice conversation, why stop?}
{133}{}{I guess it's time to leave.}
{134}{}{Oh no, it's the pest again. Look, I have nothing to say to you. Go away!}
{135}{}{}
{136}{}{}
{137}{}{I have no quarrel with you. Leave me be.}
{138}{}{}

{142}{}{Ingenting.}
{143}{}{Ingenting.}
{144}{}{Did you see someone go by here in a hurry?}
{145}{}{I see people go by here every day. I really don't pay much attention to them.}
{146}{}{Me not have time for you crap.}
{147}{}{Oh, okay.}
{148}{}{Girl life at stake. Young girl. Someone daughter. You please help?}
{149}{}{I don't have time for your crap.}
{150}{}{Fine, bye.}
{151}{}{Look, a young girl's life is at stake here. The daughter of a worried mother. Can you please
 help me out?}
{152}{}{I don't give a radrat's ass... I'm sorry. I'm just a gun who was hired to stand here and guard
 this trail. Other than that, I don't know what's going on around here. I had a daughter once, though,
 and... yeah, some guy went by here. I let him through because he knew the proper sign... just like the
 sign you gave me. Go on. I'm outta here. }
{153}{}{Thanks. Me no forget this, Dalia.}
{154}{}{Thanks. I won't forget this, Dalia.}
{155}{}{Then go the hell away and leave me be!}

{158}{}{F채rdigt.}
