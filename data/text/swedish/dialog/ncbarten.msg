{100}{}{You see a bartender.}
{150}{}{You see a pudgy-looking man tending the bar. He nods at you.}
{200}{}{Hey! }
{201}{}{! Way to kick the Enclave's ass! Want a drink?}
{206}{}{! What's up?!}
{210}{}{One shot of rotgut coming right up...}
{211}{}{That'll be three chips...}
{212}{}{Another, pal?}
{213}{}{Here's a tourniquet if you need it.}
{214}{}{Don't inhale the Jet all at once... take a hit, a deep breath, then give it
 time to settle.}
{215}{}{You want two half ounce bags, or a canister?}
{216}{}{The Jet inhaler's extra...}
{217}{}{Let me guess: Put it on your tab?}
{218}{}{One nuke on the rocks, comin' up.}
{219}{}{We don't let customers take Buffout in here, pal.}
{225}{}{You better get outta here 'fore you get served more lead than you can
 handle, understand?}
{226}{}{Go on... get out. We don't want no trouble.}
{227}{}{They're gonna kill you if you stick around. Beat it.}
{228}{}{We're all out of everything. Now go on, git.}
{236}{}{! What's yer poison?}
{237}{}{Heeeey, champ! What's yer poison?}
{238}{}{What's yer poison, pal?}

{242}{}{What's on tap?}
{243}{}{What kind of drugs do you have?}
{244}{}{Who's the old fella by that crappy slot machine?}
{245}{}{Who's the guy at the bar with the knife?}
{246}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{250}{}{Oh, you mean old man McGee? He's mostly harmless. Spent near a fortune on
 that old slot machine and hasn't seen a return in years. I think it's busted. 
 Anyways... can I get you something, friend?}
{260}{}{That's Jesus' little boy, Lil' Jesus. Him and that knife are like close
 friends... I've seen him do some wicked things with it. Anyways, can I get
 you something, friend?}
{270}{}{Pleasure doin' business with ya.}
