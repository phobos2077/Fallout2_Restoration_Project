{150}{}{You see a safe set securely into the wall. It is open.}
{200}{}{(There is a little door in the wall. A very, very small person must live inside! There is a doorknob with numbers on it in the middle of the door.)}
{220}{}{(There is a KER-KLANK, and the safe opens.)}
{230}{}{(Close inspection reveals a small cube of plastic explosive set into the wall just beneath the safe, primed to go off if the user enters the wrong combination. It was covered with a thin layer of plaster to disguise it.)}
{240}{}{(You turn the dial slowly for several minutes, but you can't make out anything.)}
{250}{}{(You don't find any traps on the safe.)}
{260}{}{(You are turning the knob... when suddenly there is a KER-KLANK, and the door opens!)}
{270}{}{(You turn the knob, but the tiny door won't open!)}
{290}{}{(You don't hear anybody, and you can't see a doorbell. Maybe nobody's home.)}
{300}{}{(With surgical precision, you disarm the fuse and pull the plastic explosive from the wall. The trap is now disarmed.)}
{310}{}{(With surgical precision, you open the primer and adjust the tumbler combination trigger. The owner of this safe will be
 in for a surprise when he tries to open it again.)}
