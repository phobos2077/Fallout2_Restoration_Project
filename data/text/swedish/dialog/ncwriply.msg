{452}{}{No, no... it's too dangerous to play with, youngster.}
{453}{}{No. You'll shoot your eye out.}
{454}{}{Why, sure you can, you little pothead. Here you go. (Give him an unloaded pistol.)}
{455}{}{Why, sure you can, you little pothead. Here you go. (Give him a loaded pistol.)}
{456}{}{"Metal insects?"}
{457}{}{Oh, okay. I was just curious.}
{458}{}{Nooooo... I think I better be going.}
{470}{}{(Glares at you.) C'mon, I know how to use guns like that! I'm in Family Wright! Let me see it! Pleeease?}
{471}{}{Look: In the wrong hands, a gun is a deadly weapon. Well, I mean, it's ALWAYS a deadly weapon, but in the wrong hands... it's, uh... deadly... hold on, let me start over.}
{472}{}{Look, if your family trusted you with a gun they would have given you one. Forget it.}
{473}{}{I don't care if you're in Family Badass, you ain't getting this gun.}
{474}{}{Well, all right. [Give him an unloaded pistol.]}
{475}{}{Well, all right. [Give him a loaded pistol.]}
{476}{}{Forget it. Go play with your friends.}
{485}{}{Yeah, metal insects! We SAW one when we were out in th' desert! It was as big... (Takes a deep breath.) ...as big as
 a HOUSE! N'it had metal PEOPLE in it.}
{486}{}{Really! Wow! Where did you see it?}
{487}{}{You're lying!}
{488}{}{I don't believe you. You're lying.}
{489}{}{You better go easy on the Jet, kid. That stuff'll kill you. Later.}
{490}{}{Really? That's amazing. I may have to go out there sometime and see for myself. Bye.}
{500}{}{In th' desert. (Squints at you suspiciously.) It's probably not there anymore, though.}
{501}{}{Are you sure you wouldn't want to show it to me anyway?}
{502}{}{Can you show me where you saw it anyway?}
{503}{}{Oh, okay. See you, then.}
{510}{}{In th' desert. (Glances around, starts whispering.) A bunch of us are going out there when it gets REALLY dark. }
{511}{}{In th' desert. (Glances around, starts whispering.) A bunch of us are going out there tonight. }
{513}{}{I'm never quiet when I come. But just this once...}
{514}{}{I'll be quiet. Lead on, MacDuff.}
{515}{}{Uh, I don't think you'll be seeing that 'metal insect' anymore. It was actually a helicopter.}
{516}{}{Not tonight, thanks. Early day tomorrow.}
{530}{}{Hunh? (Frowns and adjusts the pot on his head.) What's a hello-copter?}
{531}{}{It's a... flying machine. It can hold people and stuff inside.}
{532}{}{A helicopter is... I guess the closest approximation you'd be familiar with is 'automobile.' A helicopter is like
 an automobile that's able to rise off the ground and hover through the use of vertically rotating blades. The helicopter's
 engine spins the blades so fast it keeps it aloft. Isn't that incredible?}
{533}{}{Nevermind. Just don't go wandering around outside of town again. It could get you killed.}
{540}{}{I'm NOT lying! We SAW it in the desert! (He glares at you sullenly.)}
{541}{}{Hmmm. Maybe you ARE telling the truth. Can you show me where you saw it?}
{542}{}{Okay, I believe you. Will you show me where you saw it?}
{543}{}{Okay, okay. Nevermind. Go back to playing your game.}
{550}{}{I'm NOT lying! We SAW it in the desert! I can PROVE it! (Glares at you.) A bunch of us are going over when it gets a little darker. }
{551}{}{I'm NOT lying! We SAW it in the desert! I can PROVE it! (Glares at you.) A bunch of us are going over there tonight. }
{552}{}{Come along, and I'll show it to you. (Sneers.) If yer not SCARED.}
{556}{}{No thanks. Go back to playing your game.}
{560}{}{(You take your crappiest gun from your pack and give it to the kid. He smiles and holds it up, admiring it.) MY gun! Cool! }
{561}{}{I know where I can get ammo for it, too!}
{562}{}{Uh, you can't keep it. It's just a loan...}
{563}{}{Yep, all yours. Now tell me about these metal insects...}
{564}{}{Lock and load, kid. Say... why don't you go show your gun to Daddy? Be sure to wave it around a lot and pull that little
 switch beneath the gun there.}
{565}{}{Sure is. Enjoy. Catch you later.}
{570}{}{Tribal giver! It's mine! You gave it to me! It's my gun!}
{571}{}{Give it back, you little shit!}
{572}{}{No, it's mine. I had to hurt a lot of people for that gun. Can I pleeeease have it back?}
{573}{}{Oh, hell. This post holocaust world can't get any worse. Go on and play with it.}
{580}{}{Nuh-uh! (He runs off with your gun.)}
{581}{}{Come back here, you little shit!}
{590}{}{Okay! (He runs off.)}
{591}{}{Well, THIS little act of evil might take a while to bear fruit... better leave the area and come back.}
{592}{}{[Calmly leave the vicinity, whistling innocently.]}
{600}{}{(Shrugs.) Daddy's in the house, Mommy's at church.}
{603}{}{All right then. Just curious. Thanks.}
{610}{}{(The kid lets the pot fall down over his head, and resumes *bzzzzing* around.)}
{620}{}{(The kid shrugs. He lets the pot fall down over his head, and resumes *bzzzzing* around.)}
{630}{}{(He shakes his head. He lets the pot fall down over his head, and resumes *bzzzzing* around.)}
{631}{}{Uh, okay.}
{632}{}{You little punk... see if I save you when I'm saving the world...}
{640}{}{You wait until it gets a little darker...}
{641}{}{You wait until it gets dark...}
{642}{}{[...then you follow the kids into the desert.]}
{700}{}{GET AWAY FROM ME!}
{701}{}{Ahhh...}
{702}{}{Help me, help me...}
{703}{}{MEAN PERSON! GET AWAY!}
{704}{}{GET AWAY FROM ME!}
