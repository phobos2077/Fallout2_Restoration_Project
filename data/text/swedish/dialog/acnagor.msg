{100}{}{You see your young cousin, Nagor. You don't see his dog, Smoke, anywhere.}
{101}{}{You've known Nagor since he was an infant, and have always helped him when you could.}
{102}{}{Cousin, am I glad to see you! I need your help.}
{103}{}{Sorry, but I don't have the time.}
{104}{}{What do you need help with?}
{105}{}{Then I'll go out in the wilds myself!}
{106}{}{Hold on there... what was it you need help with?}
{107}{}{You do that.}
{108}{}{Smoke ran off into the hunting grounds and hasn't come back and now Morlis
 won't let me go find him. She says it's too dangerous and he's just a dog, but I was
 going to go anyway. But now you're here and you could do it and I wouldn't get in
 trouble.}
{109}{}{Sure. But where are the hunting grounds?}
{110}{}{Sure. I'll find him right now.}
{111}{}{Forget it, I don't have time for this.}
{112}{}{What'd you do, get hit in the head with a rock? They're on the far side of
 Hakunin's tent, north of the village.}
{113}{}{I'll be back with him soon.}
{114}{}{Have you found Smoke yet?}
{115}{}{No, not yet. Where did you say the hunting grounds were?}
{116}{}{No, not yet.}
{117}{}{Have you found Smoke yet?}
{118}{}{No, not yet. I'll be back soon, though.}
{119}{}{I am sorry, but he is dead.}
{120}{}{You're just saying that 'cause you don't wanna look! I don't care what
 Morlis says, I'm going to find him.}
{121}{}{Nagor, what if something happens to you? Morlis would be alone and that would
 make her real sad. You don't want to make her sad, do you?}
{122}{}{You do that.}
{123}{}{Well... no, I don't want to do that. Okay, I won't go, but it's not fair!}
{124}{}{Smoke will be okay. Goodbye.}
{125}{}{You found Smoke! Thanks! Smoke, you're a bad dog!}
{126}{}{You're welcome. Goodbye.}
{127}{}{Thanks again. I hope you have a really fun trip!}
{128}{}{I miss Smoke. Why couldn't you save him? You're the Chosen One.}
{129}{}{I'm busy, dumb one. Go play someplace else.}
{130}{}{I go.}
{131}{}{I'm going after Smoke.}
{200}{}{Hello cousin... uh, I mean Chosen One. I hope you've found the GECK. I've heard a lot of
 talk about hard times to come.}
{201}{}{Hello cousin... uh, I mean Chosen One. I hope you've found the GECK. I've heard a lot of
 talk about hard times to come.}
{202}{}{Me still look, Nagor.}
{203}{}{I'm still looking, cousin.}
{204}{}{Welcome home, cousin. Things are getting a little tight around here. Have you found the holy
 Thirteen and the GECK?}
{205}{}{Welcome home, cousin. Things are getting a little tight around here. Have you found the holy
 Thirteen and the GECK?}
{206}{}{Me not find. Sorry.}
{207}{}{I'm sorry, Nagor. I'm still looking.}
{208}{}{Hello again, cousin. I guess you've noticed that things are really falling apart here. Please
 find the GECK. We are in desperate need!}
{209}{}{Hello again, cousin. I guess you've noticed that things are really falling apart here. Please
 find the GECK. We are in desperate need!}
{210}{}{Hi, cousin.}
{211}{}{Hi, cousin.}
{212}{}{You not sound like usual self.}
{213}{}{You don't sound like your usual self.}
{214}{}{I'm sorry, cousin. Things have been getting worse and worse since you last left. People are
 sick, the brahmin are dying and... I... my dog Smoke died - Morlis cooked him. I miss him so much. Sorry, but I can't
 really talk any more...}
{215}{}{I'm sorry, cousin. Things have been getting worse and worse since you last left. People are sick,
 the brahmin are dying and... I... my dog Smoke died. I miss him so much. Sorry, but I can't really
 talk any more...}
{300}{}{You see Nagor.}
{302}{}{Cousin, am I glad to see you! I need your help.}
