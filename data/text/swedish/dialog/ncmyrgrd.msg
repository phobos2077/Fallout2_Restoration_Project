{262}{}{That robot's gonna be scrap if it stays.}
{270}{}{I *thought* I smelled mutant. Get him outta here 'fore we get mad.}
{271}{}{You a mutant lover? His place is OUTSIDE. Or else.}
{272}{}{That mutant looking to become target practice? Stick around and he'll get his wish.}
{280}{}{I *thought* I smelled something rotting. Get that ghoul boy o' yours outta here.}
{281}{}{Get that stinky ghoul mother fucker outta here. Now.}
{282}{}{That ghoul ain't outta here in a minute, he's gonna be deader than he already is.}
{290}{}{::Whoa.:: Check THAT out.}
{291}{}{Hey, chica, you looking for some company?}
{292}{}{Wanna waste some time with us, chica?}
{293}{}{::Howls like a wolf when he sees you:: Awooooooo!}
{300}{}{What the hell do you want, slaver? Slaves are upstairs.}
{305}{}{What happened to Myron?}
{310}{}{Myron still sleeping it off?}
{311}{}{I'm bored.}
{312}{}{Catch the fight last night?}
{313}{}{Can't wait until this shift is over.}
{320}{}{Help you with somthin', amigo? This area's off-limits.}
{321}{}{Well, well, well... we got us a star in our midst. You got an appointment with Myron, chica?}
{322}{}{Help you with somthin', chica? This area's off-limits.}
{323}{}{(The guard smiles, looks you up and down.) Got an appointment with Myron, chica?}
{324}{}{Me want world peace}
{325}{}{Me want to go past door}
{326}{}{Hoo Yoo}
{327}{}{Wander off}
{328}{}{Off-Limits? What's behind that door?}
{329}{}{I'm here to see Myron.}
{330}{}{I'm here to see Myron. I have a badge.}
{331}{}{I'm here to see Myron. Me and him got a "special appointment," see?}
{332}{}{Sure do. You gonna keep me standing here, handsome, or have your eyes had their fill yet?}
{333}{}{I'm sorry? What appointment?}
{334}{}{Sorry, wrong room. I'll be going now.}
{350}{}{You escape from your stall, slave? Maybe you better get your ass back upstairs before we put you in one
 of the cages.}
{351}{}{ME WANT WORLD PEACE ME WANT WORLD PEACE}
{352}{}{ME SAY ME WANT TO GO PAST DOOR}
{353}{}{HOO YOO}

{360}{}{(Readies weapon.) I'm gonna enjoy this. I ain't beaten a slave for at least an hour...}
{361}{}{(Readies weapon.) I'm gonna enjoy this. I ain't killed no one for two days...}
{362}{}{YOO ONE WHO GET HURT}
{363}{}{ SMASH}
{364}{}{[Try and run.]}
{365}{}{Pal, you're about to get the ass whipping of a life time.}
{370}{}{(Sneers.) Sorry. "Need-ta-know" basis. Now get lost... amigo.}
{371}{}{(Sneers.) Sorry. "Need-ta-know" basis. Now get lost, chica.}
{374}{}{Let me by. I have to get past that door.}
{375}{}{All right, all right.}
{380}{}{Oh, you ARE, are you? Well, goddamn, why didn't you say something earlier? We could have avoided
 this talk altogether, and I could have told you to piss off right from the start.}
{381}{}{Myron's expecting me. You better let me see him, or you'll hear about it later.}
{390}{}{Nah. You ain't gonna see him. Now piss off before you make me angry.}
{391}{}{Can you at least give him a message for me?}
{400}{}{Nope. Now piss OFF, you little shit.}
{401}{}{I'm staying until you let me in. In fact, I'd like to see you TRY and move me.}
{402}{}{I'm staying until you let me in. In fact, I'd like to see you sorry sacks of shit TRY and move me.}
{404}{}{All right.}
{411}{}{Neither have I...}
{412}{}{Defend yourself.}
{425}{}{Yeah? Lemme see. Hmmmm. (Checks badge, shrugs.) All right, but keep it quick. Myron's busy, and he don't
 like being disturbed.}
{426}{}{Got it.}
{435}{}{(Eyes roam up and down your body.) Yeah, for now... heh heh... though, I might need ANOTHER fill a little
 later on. When you're done inside, that is.}
{436}{}{I'll... keep that in mind. Can I head on in?}
{437}{}{We'll see, all right?}
{445}{}{Sure, sweetheart. Head on in.}
{446}{}{Yeah, head on in.}
{447}{}{Tack.}
{455}{}{You? Ha! Chica, unless Myron suddenly went blind, you ain't going in there. I know his tastes, right?
 He ain't interested in any skanky Jet-begging whore.}
{457}{}{Look, I'm here to see Myron. I have a badge.}
{458}{}{I'll be going now.}
{465}{}{Oh, sorry. Thought you were someone else. What do you want, chica?}
{466}{}{What's behind that door?}
{475}{}{Myron expecting you?}
{477}{}{Yes. Can I head on in? We have business to discuss.}
{478}{}{No, not right now. Take care, you guys.}
{479}{}{Yes. Can I head on in? We have "business" to discuss. If you know what I mean. (You wink at the guard.)}
{480}{}{Heh, I sure do. Try not to make too much of a ruckus while you're here. (To himself) Damn, Myron's such a lucky
 man.)}
{485}{}{Myron ain't in.}
{487}{}{Can I head in anyway?}
{495}{}{(Shrugs.) I don't care. If you wanna wait for him, go ahead. I don't know when he's gonna be back... or if
 he is gonna be back.}
{5225}{}{! Whazzup?}
{5230}{}{s! Waste 'em!}
{5236}{}{ man who don't know when he's about to die.}
{5240}{}{ kennel, puta?}
