{100}{}{You see a striking woman in a long robe.}
{101}{}{It's the Enlightened One.}
{102}{}{Her fixed stare and expression of mindless bliss would be disturbing were she not so tranquil.}
{103}{}{Greetings, child. Are you one of the Enlightened?}
{104}{}{<Drool>}
{105}{}{Sure, why not?}
{106}{}{Well, I am the Chosen One.}
{107}{}{Uh, I really don't know what you're talking about.}
{108}{}{So you're the itch Merk wants scratched!}
{109}{}{Ja.}
{110}{}{Nej.}
{111}{}{I just want to be alone.}
{112}{}{Hello? Anybody there?}
{113}{}{Guh.}
{114}{}{No-body here.}
{115}{}{Oh dear, a Level One. Still trapped in primitive state. Perhaps a zeta-scan alignment would help. Would you like that?}
{116}{}{Zay-ta!}
{117}{}{Nej!}
{118}{}{Please don't mock the Church of Hubology. It's oppressors like you who make things hard for the rest of us. Oh, dear. I'm all turbulent!}
{119}{}{Chosen One? Don't you mean AHS-One? Just what text are you working from?}
{120}{}{It's simple. I am the Chosen One because that is what must be.}
{121}{}{AHS one?}
{122}{}{That's what my Elder says I am.}
{123}{}{What are you talking about?}
{124}{}{Can we just get to the part where you sprinkle holy water on me or something?}
{125}{}{Oh. Well, are you seeking true understanding and spiritual peace? We can help.}
{126}{}{No, I'm looking for a GECK.}
{127}{}{Help? How?}
{128}{}{A rocket launcher gives me all the spiritual peace I need, lady.}
{129}{}{"True understand" this! (Rude hand gesture with the middle finger.)}
{130}{}{Merk? What's he want?}
{131}{}{Simple. He wants you dead. Say bye-bye.}
{132}{}{I don't know what you did, but he's put a contract out on you.}
{133}{}{Wonderful, brother. So what level are you?}
{134}{}{I asked you first.}
{135}{}{What level are you?}
{136}{}{Oh. I assumed you could see my aura. I'm sorry.}
{137}{}{Oh. I assumed you could see my aura. I'm sorry.}
{138}{}{Well, last time I checked the character screen, I was at level }
{139}{}{Why, I'm at Transcendency, of course.}
{140}{}{Uhhh... isn't it really impolite to go talking about levels?}
{141}{}{Honestly! I don't know what they expect me to accomplish surrounded by such rim meat!}
{142}{}{Ah, such enthusiasm. Come with me.}
{143}{}{"Lost are those who will not seek the Hub." If you should ever change your mind, you are always welcome.}
{144}{}{Do not shout! Now I've got a neurodyne to align!}
{145}{}{Predestination? What about free will? By your belief, nothing you do has any meaning since it's all determined in advance. It's like you're just a pawn in a game.}
{146}{}{You misunderstand. Only my potential as the Chosen One is pre-determined. My choices and my actions determine the fulfillment of that potential.}
{147}{}{Of course the universe is deterministic! After all, we've been put here for some purpose that's already known to our creator.}
{148}{}{Nonsense. There is no organizing force determining our fates. In fact there's no 'higher power' behind anything. The universe is just chance. I am the Chosen One because others have declared it. That's all.}
{149}{}{Aligned Hub Seeker. You are obviously not Enlightened.}
{150}{}{A primitive belief - but you show signs of great promise. We can show you the higher path. Would you like to know more?}
{151}{}{Ja.}
{152}{}{Nej.}
{153}{}{I can't help you with that. However, our scientists in San Francisco might know something. Perhaps you should travel there.}
{154}{}{By purging you of the negative psychic energy that keeps you in an oppressive state. Only then can you be Enlightened!}
{155}{}{Neurodynes are the psychic centers of the body. They become polluted by the spiritual remnants of the people who died in the War. Their psi-energies imprint into our neurodynes at birth and hold us in an oppressive state. Alignment erases these imprints.}
{156}{}{As long as your brain chemistry is affected by negative psychic energy, your true spiritual potential is oppressed. Worse still, oppressives can transmit this energy unless they are very, very strong-willed.}
{157}{}{Enlightenment happens when all your neurodynes are aligned. Then you become an AHS, Aligned Hub Seeker, which is the goal of all Hubonites.}
{158}{}{Neurodynes?}
{159}{}{Enlightened?}
{160}{}{Oppressive state?}
{161}{}{So how's this purging work? Is it painful?}
{162}{}{It's not painful. You just undergo a zeta-scan. I can do one now, if you like.}
{163}{}{Visst.}
{164}{}{No way!}
{165}{}{The Church of Hubology exists to free mankind from the chains that have kept his full spiritual potential in shackles.}
{166}{}{How do you do that?}
{167}{}{Oh yeah, like "Let my psyche go," right?}
{168}{}{That is not an ability that I possess. Is there something else that I can help you with? An alignment perhaps?}
{169}{}{I'll take the alignment.}
{170}{}{I need some information. Vault 13 - what do you know about it?}
{171}{}{How have things been going?}
{172}{}{Forget about it. No hard feelings. That's all.}
{173}{}{That's impressive. Though I believe we are speaking about two different things, it still sounds like you deserve an experience bonus.}
{174}{}{Yes!!}
{175}{}{It's done. Just remember though, there's more to life than gaining enough experience points to reach the next level. There's a whole "real" world out there.
 Now that we have that out of the way, shall we try again?}
{176}{}{Transcendency? Honestly, how do they expect me to spread the word out here when they don't even keep me up-to-date on the latest doctrine!?}
{177}{}{(Continue)}
{178}{}{Were you asleep during indoctrination? Hmmph - you are not one of the Enlightened!}
{179}{}{So you're saying there's some higher power who creates us with a purpose and then just abandons us? I can't believe any being would be so callous. Come, embrace the Church of Hubology. Let us show you the true way.}
{180}{}{What true way?}
{181}{}{No thanks.}
{182}{}{Without control of your own life, though, what's the point? Nothing you do has any value. Did you choose to get up this morning? No, you're just a puppet by your own philosophy. Now, we at the church of Hubology have a true answer.}
{183}{}{Which is?}
{184}{}{Sure you do.}
{185}{}{Oh, what a sad and empty philosophy that is! Even if it were true, the only course for you is to seek to develop yourself. It is the only thing you have any control over. The Church of Hubology can help.}
{186}{}{How?}
{187}{}{Oh, get out of my face.}
{188}{}{Vault 13? Our scientists have been searching for it somewhere to the west. That is all I know. Are you sure you don't want an alignment?}
{189}{}{Sure, why not.}
{190}{}{No thanks. I'm fine.}
{191}{}{I tell you, spreading the word of Hubology out here is harder than you can imagine! AHS-9 just doesn't understand the difficulty. In fact, I've written it all down. Say, would you be willing to deliver it to AHS-9 in San Francisco? I can't promise any reward, but I know AHS-9 will appreciate it.}
{192}{}{Sure, why not?}
{193}{}{No thanks. I don't get involved.}
{194}{}{Excellent. Here is the letter. Now, can I do anything else for you? A zeta-scan?}
{195}{}{A scan? Why not.}
{196}{}{You've already done enough. Bye.}
{197}{}{Then I've spoken too much already. Goodbye.}
{198}{}{Greetings again. How can the Church of Hubology help you?}
{199}{}{<Drool>}
{200}{}{So you're the itch Merk wants scratched!}
{201}{}{Uh, I really don't know what you're talking about.}
{202}{}{What does the church do?}
{203}{}{Oops. Wrong door.}
{204}{}{Killing me will serve no purpose. I'm not a threat to Merk, I simply irritate him because of my beliefs. I hope you'll refuse to honor the contract.}
{205}{}{Yeah, you seem harmless.}
{206}{}{Forget it. You're one dead Hubologist.}
{207}{}{I don't have time for idiots. Please go away.}
{208}{}{Out, apostate!}
{209}{}{There is nothing you can say to gain favor in the Church of Hubology, blasphemer.}
{210}{}{Close your eyes. This won't hurt a bit.}
{211}{}{There. We erased a few nasty imprints! You are now an AHS-1. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to tend my church.}
{212}{}{Greetings, fellow seeker. There is nothing more I can do for you. You must continue your journey as an AHS-1 on your own.}
{213}{}{The church is closed. Come back tomorrow.}
{214}{}{I would love to help you, but even an AHS-4 must sleep. Come back in daylight.}
{215}{}{Intruder! Do you plan to desecrate this place? Out!}
{216}{}{Wonderful, sister. So what level are you?}
{217}{}{. I'm sure if I keep wandering and killing random creatures I'll hit level 99 in no time.}
{218}{}{You gain }
{219}{}{ experience points for "taking care of" the Hubologist for Merk.}
