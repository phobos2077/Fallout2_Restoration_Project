{100}{}{You see a mean looking man.}
{101}{}{You see Metzger, the slaver master.}
{150}{}{Metzger's the head of the Slaver's Guild.}
{200}{}{You'll pay for that.}
{210}{}{What the fuck do you want? This is the Slaver's Guild, not some safe
 house for you fucking jetheads.}
{211}{}{What the hell do you want, you ugly bitch? This is the Slaver's
 Guild, not some fucking whorehouse.}
{212}{}{What the hell do you want, bitch? This is the Slaver's Guild, not some
 fucking whorehouse.}
{213}{}{You're starting to piss me off. What the hell do you want now?}
{214}{}{Now what, damn it?}
{215}{}{Vad?}
{216}{}{Oh, you better make it quick.}
{217}{}{You here to work for a fucking change?}
{218}{}{I'm starting to get used to your ugly mug. So... are you here for a reason or what?}
{219}{}{Do I look like your fucking dad or something? I sure as hell hope not. Now spit it
 out, what do you want?}
{220}{}{Oh, look who's here. You think you're special or something? Speak up or get the
 fuck out.}
{221}{}{What do you want now, slaver?}
{222}{}{You just going to stand there or are you going to say something?}
{223}{}{Speak up. I don't have all day for this crap.}
{230}{}{Oh, and 'who' would that be? I hope you don't plan on seeing this person again...}
{231}{}{You don't have anyone that I'm interested in. I'm only interested in people -
 normal ones, that is.}
{232}{}{You fucking moron, what do you think I am, a fucking store or something? If you get
 a slave you'd like to sell, let me know. If you want to sell something else, go to a fucking store.}
{233}{}{Miria}
{234}{}{Davin}
{235}{}{Vic}
{236}{}{Myron}
{237}{}{Cassidy}
{238}{}{Sulik}
{239}{}{Can I ask you another question instead?}
{240}{}{I changed my mind. Bye.}
{241}{}{Dex}
{242}{}{Cat Jules}
{243}{}{Kitsune}
{245}{}{Go ahead.}
{246}{}{Visst?}
{247}{}{I'm not your fucking servant, so hurry it up.}
{248}{}{What is it? I don't have all day.}
{249}{}{Shoot.}
{250}{}{Kanske.}
{255}{}{I have someone I'd like to sell.}
{256}{}{About Vic...}
{257}{}{I'm looking for a merchant.}
{258}{}{Lara wanted me to ask you for permission to fight Tyler.}
{259}{}{Can I join the guild?}
{260}{}{What can you tell me about your guild?}
{261}{}{I'd like to go on a slave run.}
{262}{}{Never mind. Bye.}
{263}{}{ want to ill.}
{264}{}{Na.}
{265}{}{I was looking over the slaves you got back there, but you see, I have very, uh...*selective* tastes, and none of
 them are quite what I'm looking for. Are these all the slaves you have to offer?}
{270}{}{You think you can cut it? I don't take in just anyone... What the hell. If
 you fuck up, I'll sell you off. You'll have to get a tattoo on your forehead
 identifying you as a slaver to everyone. It's permanent, so no second thoughts.}
{271}{}{So, our delicate little flower girl returns... You changed your mind then?
 Going to get that tat after all?}
{272}{}{Yeah, you might do... You don't need much in the way of brains to go on a run.
 If you fuck up, I'll just sell you off. If you think you can cut it you'll have
 to get a tattoo on your forehead identifying you to everyone as slaver.}
{273}{}{Let's do it.}
{274}{}{I have to think about it. I'll get back to you.}
{275}{}{Maybe not. Bye.}
{276}{}{Uya! [nod]}
{277}{}{No no no no no!}
{285}{}{What do you fucking think? This is a slaving guild. I buy and sell slaves.}
{286}{}{Where do you get the slaves?}
{287}{}{I'd like to join.}
{288}{}{Another question please.}
{289}{}{Oh, okay. Bye.}
{300}{}{Oh, here and there. We mainly collect primitives and nomads when we run across them.}
{301}{}{Sounds like fun. How can I get in on that?}
{302}{}{I have another question.}
{303}{}{Oh, okay. Bye.}
{310}{}{What do you know, you didn't even cry. I'm so proud of you... actually, that tat
 looks pretty good on you. Just give a holler when you're ready for your first slave run.}
{311}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{312}{}{I'm ready right now.}
{313}{}{Me Kill NOW!}
{314}{}{Okey-Dokey.}
{320}{}{Two of my men will get you fairly close to your targets. Your pay will be based
 on the number of the slaves you return, but watch each other's backs. If anyone
 gets killed, your pay will be severely cut.}
{321}{}{Damn, we're all farmed out. Have to wait for some primitives to move back into the
 area. Maybe we should start breeding them.}
{322}{}{Sorry, you're just not working out. Too many losses and this is a business. I need
 to make money, not lose it.}
{323}{}{All right. They're ready.}
{324}{}{Good, you can leave now.}
{325}{}{Get a move on it then.}
{326}{}{Good. See me when you're done.}
{327}{}{Okej.}
{328}{}{Eh.}
{340}{}{Just kill all the hostile ones. If they attack you, kill them. I don't
 want to deal with them anymore, too big of a fucking hassle. Once you're done,
 the other slavers will round up and tag the rest.}
{341}{}{Okej.}
{342}{}{Åh.}
{350}{}{Once they start tagging the slaves, you can head back if you like. It takes
 special training, so don't try to subdue the others yourself. You can do whatever
 you want just as long as you don't damage the goods.}
{351}{}{All right.}
{352}{}{Uh huh.}
{360}{}{Ah, yeah. She's pretty nice. I'll give you $}
{361}{}{He's okay. I could probably take him off your hands for, oh, say $}
{362}{}{You fucking idiot. What the hell makes you think I want that moron back? It took
 him forever to fix a damn radio! A radio! You're stuck with him. I don't want him
 breaking anything else around here.}
{363}{}{I don't know, this one's pretty skinny... but a smart one? That might be worth something. I'll give you $}
{364}{}{This one looks like he could really put up a fight. Hmm... $}
{365}{}{Another primitive. This one's a freak show. Still, he looks strong and that look might fetch something extra. $}
{366}{}{How about someone else?}
{367}{}{Well, let me ask you another question then.}
{368}{}{Okej.}
{369}{}{Bra.}
{370}{}{Okej.}
{371}{}{Not worth it.}
{372}{}{Nej.}
{380}{}{All right, boys, put him in the pens.}
{381}{}{All right, boys, put her in the pens.}
{382}{}{Right, boss.}
{390}{}{Well don't waste my fucking time then. If you ever get someone you're
 looking to part with, come see me.}
{391}{}{I've got another question for you.}
{392}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{400}{}{What the hell crawled up her ass all of a sudden? I gave that bitch a chance
 a while back. Didn't think she had the balls to try this.}
{401}{}{What are you talking about?}
{402}{}{So it's okay?}
{410}{}{Oh, don't play coy with me. I know exactly what she's planning to do. I
 gave her a chance a while back and she couldn't cut it, but if she
 thinks she's up to it...}
{411}{}{So, it's okay?}
{420}{}{Well, I did say the offer would remain open. If she finally thinks she can kick his ass and
 is better able to guard my shit...}
{421}{}{Nå?}
{422}{}{So, that's a yes?}
{430}{}{Look, I don't give a shit which of them guards it. Just as long as none of my goods are
 damaged, I don't care.}
{431}{}{Another question, please.}
{432}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{440}{}{What the fuck are you asking me for? Do I look like some kind of fucking... oh,
 wait. You're probably looking for Vic?}
{441}{}{He's the one that 'specializes' in vault technology, or so he says. He's my
 property now. He's not going anywhere.}
{442}{}{What about him?}
{443}{}{Yeah, that's him.}
{444}{}{Can I see him?}
{445}{}{Why are you keeping him here?}
{446}{}{Okay, thanks. Bye.}
{455}{}{That little fuck - he sold me a radio that he said would be able to pick up
 some transmissions. It didn't. I caught his ass trying to sneak out of town before
 I found out. Bad mistake. No one fucks with me. He's lucky to be alive.}
{456}{}{Like I said. He needs to fix something first. After that we'll see.}
{457}{}{Well he's finally gotten that damn radio to work, but it doesn't mean I'm going to let
 him off that easy.}
{458}{}{He still tried to screw me over.}
{459}{}{Can I see him?}
{460}{}{What kind of transmissions are you talking about?}
{461}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{462}{}{Maybe some money might help clear things up?}
{463}{}{What kind transmissions were you talking about before?}
{475}{}{What for? Ah, fuck, never mind. Just don't keep him from fixing that damn
 radio - and he better fix it soon. I'm sick of feeding his lazy ass.}
{476}{}{Why are you keeping him here?}
{477}{}{Tack.}
{485}{}{The Enclave and New... Hey, what the hell you care for? It's business. I need to be sure no one's trying to fuck me over. That's all you need to know.}
{486}{}{Mind your own business.}
{487}{}{Okej.}
{495}{}{Sure, but it'll cost you $}
{496}{}{$}
{497}{}{Can't we work something out?}
{498}{}{Okay. Here.}
{499}{}{Can I ask you some more questions first.}
{500}{}{Sorry, can't afford that yet.}
{510}{}{Okay, he's yours, but get his ass out of here before I change my mind
 and put a bullet in that stupid fucking head of his.}
{511}{}{Can I ask you some more questions first?}
{512}{}{Thank you.}
{520}{}{Oh, yes. We can work everything out nice and smooth... I'll give you
 half off if you make it worth my while...}
{521}{}{You had best stop teasing me, girly. I'm not much with patience.}
{522}{}{Only if you're good to me.}
{523}{}{Sure, why not.}
{524}{}{Maybe later.}
{530}{}{Oh, you better believe it.}
{531}{}{Bra.}
{540}{}{Here's $}
{541}{}{Here's your $}
{542}{}{Good job out there. Here's $}
{543}{}{Here's your money, }
{544}{}{$}
{545}{}{Well it's $}
{546}{}{It wasn't that tough, now was it? Next time no mistakes. Here's $}
{547}{}{$}
{548}{}{Come on! $}
{549}{}{Remember, watch each other's backs and only kill the hostile slaves. Here's $}
{550}{}{Only $}
{551}{}{You want to make any money or not? You're pissing me off. How fucking
 hard can it be? Now take your $}
{552}{}{What the hell was your problem? You don't earn shit this time. We're
 in this to make money, not dick around.}
{553}{}{I'll do better next time.}
{554}{}{Thanks for nothing.}
{555}{}{Tack.}
{556}{}{Ug.}
{570}{}{Damn bitch, was that your first time? There's no way that was not your first time.}
{571}{}{Damn girl, was that your first time?}
{572}{}{Pretty good, I guess.}
{573}{}{Very nice, maybe we can do it again sometime.}
{574}{}{Damn! That was... very well spent money.}
{575}{}{Damn! You were the best piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had a lot.}
{600}{}{YOU STUPID FUCK! How dare you abandon your fellow slavers out there? [Spits in your face] KILL HIM!}
{601}{}{But I...}
{602}{}{Alright, let's do this.}
{620}{}{Well, nice to see you could make it back.}
{621}{}{Yeah, it was a tough run.}
{622}{}{Thanks. Things got a little hairy out there.}
{623}{}{Agra Moo ne!}
{630}{}{Oh, you want money? You want to be paid?}
{631}{}{Yah.}
{632}{}{Ugh.}
{640}{}{Of course I'd LOVE to help you out but... there's this slight problem I have... something about attacking one of my men.}
{641}{}{Sorry! I didn't mean to- I mean... Ug?}
{642}{}{Uh, oh.}
{650}{}{Oh, don't worry. I'm sure I can find it in my heart to pay- I mean repay you. Men, it's payday.}
{651}{}{Oh, don't worry. I'm sure I can find it in my heart to pay- I mean repay you. Men,
 take this bitch down.}
{652}{}{Hoppsan.}
{653}{}{Garaka!}
{654}{}{Uh... Tank?}
{670}{}{Oh, I'm sure. This line of work isn't to be taken lightly. It takes trust and loyalty. We watch each other's backs. Good policy don't you think?}
{671}{}{I guess.}
{672}{}{Uh, what's going on?}
{673}{}{Definitivt.}
{680}{}{You guess? I didn't think you were that smart. You really are a stupid fuck.
 [Metzger glares at you then looks to his guards and motions in your direction.]}
{681}{}{Actions?}
{682}{}{Vad?}
{690}{}{Oh, so you aren't as dumb as you act. Well, that's a shame. You see, I'm having a bit of a dilemma. Someone had the nerve to attack my men.}
{691}{}{Verkligen?}
{692}{}{It was an accident!}
{700}{}{Really? I'm so glad you agree. Now what would you do if someone betrayed this trust?}
{701}{}{Uh, give them a warning?}
{702}{}{Here. Let me show you. [attack]}
{703}{}{Make them pay.}
{710}{}{You think so? Honestly? I don't know. I was thinking of something a little more... permanent. [With an evil grin, Metzger looks to his guards and nods.]}
{711}{}{Vad?}
{712}{}{Oh boy...}
{720}{}{I'm glad we're in agreement. [Metzger looks to his guards.] Men, it's payday.}
{721}{}{Eh...}
{730}{}{Yes. It's a shame really. This person just doesn't seem to get it, but
 I think they are about to. [You see Metzger making a small hand gesture to his
 men.] Play time.}
{731}{}{Oh really?}
{732}{}{Uh oh.}
{740}{}{Yes, I'm afraid accidents happen around here quite often. In fact, I'm afraid we're about to have another one. [Metzger smiles pleasantly and then nods towards his men.]}
{741}{}{Bring it on!}
{742}{}{I'm not getting out of this am I?}
{750}{}{Oh, but this will be fun. Trust me.}
{751}{}{Fuck you.}
{752}{}{Uh, okay.}
{800}{}{You've killed the leader of the Slave Guild.}
{900}{}{What you see is what you get. If you don't like my merchandise, then get the fuck out of my face and stop wasting my time.}
{901}{}{Uh, sorry. Let me ask you something else then.}
{902}{}{Right. I think I'll go then.}
{903}{}{Actually, I think I'm going to waste *you* and your whole sick fucking operation.}
{910}{}{This is all I've got in stock here, you picky fuck, but I've always got new merchandise coming in from my other slave camp.
 Maybe if you check back later, I'll have something that tickles your fancy -- but they're mostly ignorant tribals that all look the
 fucking same, so if that's not your thing, you might be shit outta luck.}
{911}{}{Look, this might be an unusual request, but I'd really like to get first dibs on any new merchandise you got. Is there some
 way I could go check out the stock at your other camp? Of course, I'd be willing to pay a premium price.}
{912}{}{Alright, I'll keep checking back then.}
{913}{}{Good, but next time do me a favor and don't waste my time unless you've got actual business to discuss.}
{914}{}{Premium price, huh? Now you're talking my kinda language. We usually handle sales here, but I suppose an exception could be made,
 as long as you're serious. I'll tell you how to get there, but you better keep it to your fucking self. I swear, if you turn out to be a
 spy for them fucking Rangers, I'll hunt you down and skin you alive. [You listen to his directions, and note the Slaver Camp's location in your Pip-Boy.]}
{915}{}{Got it. Let me ask you something else.}
{916}{}{Thanks. I'll be on my way now. Bye.}
{1360}{}{ for her. How about it?}
{1361}{}{?}
{1363}{}{.}
{1364}{}{.}
{1365}{}{?}
{1496}{}{.}
{1540}{}{. Pretty fucking good job.}
{1541}{}{. You kicked some serious ass. Keep it up.}
{1542}{}{.}
{1543}{}{. $}
{1544}{}{ isn't something to laugh at, but you can't make a lot more than that.}
{1545}{}{ this time. Pretty good job.}
{1546}{}{.}
{1547}{}{? Not bad.}
{1548}{}{? You can do better than that.}
{1549}{}{.}
{1550}{}{! That's fucking pitiful! Shape up or I'll kick your ass out.}
{1551}{}{ and get out.}
{2540}{}{.}
{2543}{}{.}
{15401}{}{. Pretty fucking good job, }
