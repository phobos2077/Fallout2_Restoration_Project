{100}{}{You see a scrawny old guy with a pen stuck behind his ear and spectacles balanced on the end of his nose.}
{101}{}{It's Vortis, the owner of this slave pen.}
{102}{}{He's got about three teeth. His fingers and shirt are stained with blue ink. There's a really faded slaver's tattoo on his forehead.}
{103}{}{So what do you want?}
{104}{}{Brother, welcome to Vortis' hall. How can I help you?}
{105}{}{You're starting to annoy me.}
{106}{}{This place is my place and I, Vortis, run an honest and legitimate business no matter what anybody in NCR tells you. Since NCR doesn't allow slaves inside the gates, I mind them for folks who've got business inside.}
{107}{}{What are you, dense? This is a slave pen. I got licenses for it.}
{108}{}{}
{109}{}{Just got some questions.}
{110}{}{I'm looking for work.}
{111}{}{Eh?}
{112}{}{Not outhouse? Me go away.}
{113}{}{What's this place do?}
{114}{}{Nothing. Wrong place.}
{115}{}{Oh, look - the goody two-shoes, lollipop kid. Boys, escort this hypocritical paragon of saintly virtue out of my sight!}
{116}{}{Fuck this.}
{117}{}{Nå?}
{118}{}{I'm looking for Vault 13.}
{119}{}{Do you have a GECK?}
{120}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{121}{}{You're slaver scum! Why shouldn't I kill you?}
{122}{}{I heard there's these guys - New California Rangers. They been giving you any trouble?}
{123}{}{Mind if I have a look around?}
{124}{}{Work? Well... there might be something. You ever hear of the New California Rangers?}
{125}{}{Ja.}
{126}{}{Nej.}
{127}{}{Fuck you. Boys, escort this annoying crud out of my sight.}
{128}{}{Bite me!}
{129}{}{Vault 13! Get outta here. Damn place is a myth. Vault 13, my ass.}
{130}{}{Another question...}
{131}{}{Well, thanks for nothing.}
{132}{}{A what? Well, whatever it is, I ain't got it.}
{133}{}{Another question...}
{134}{}{Well, thanks for nothing.}
{135}{}{New California Republic - nothing but temperance types and merchants. Got a bug about slavers and slavery, but what the hell, it makes my business.}
{136}{}{Another question...}
{137}{}{Thanks, got to go.}
{138}{}{Somebody steered you wrong. I don't have no trouble with nobody - especially not no Rangers. I'm all legal, so there ain't nothing on me.}
{139}{}{Another question...}
{140}{}{Whatever you say. I'll be going.}
{141}{}{Yeah, I may have some feelings about the Rangers. You looking for work?}
{142}{}{Ja.}
{143}{}{Nej.}
{144}{}{No, you may not go nosing around, shit-for-brains! This ain't a museum!}
{145}{}{Another question...}
{146}{}{You're too touchy for me. I'm leaving.}
{147}{}{Well then, you should know some folks see them as a potential problem. It would be extremely useful if we had a map of their safe houses through the north - New Reno, Klamath, wherever. I'd be willing to pay, oh say, $500 for something like that. You think you could get that for me?}
{148}{}{Visst.}
{149}{}{I don't think so.}
{150}{}{Let me tell you, then. These Rangers have got it in their heads to wipe out slavery and slavers - by force. They've been creating a lot of trouble for hard working folks.}
{151}{}{They work in secret, especially up north.}
{152}{}{Jeez, I got to spell this out for you? They raid slavers, drive off the stock, and smuggle 'em down south to NCR lands where slavery's illegal. So you interested?}
{153}{}{There is no "and"! You want the job or not?}
{154}{}{Och?}
{155}{}{So what you want me to do?}
{156}{}{Fine. When you get me a map, I'll be here.}
{157}{}{Where am I going to find a map?}
{158}{}{Okay, I got some other questions, though.}
{159}{}{I'm on it. I'll see you then.}
{160}{}{How the hell should I know!? If I knew, I'd have it, wouldn't I? Look, there's supposed to be a cell in town. Find them and see what you can do.}
{161}{}{Just a few more questions.}
{162}{}{Alright. I'll be back.}
{163}{}{You're back again. Did you get that map?}
{164}{}{Ja.}
{165}{}{Nej.}
{166}{}{I'm still waiting for you to finish the first job!}
{167}{}{Oh yeah, I forgot.}
{168}{}{Not since you did your job. Thanks.}
{169}{}{Just a question or two.}
{170}{}{No problem. Bye.}
{171}{}{Good work. Now you best make yourself scarce, in case those Rangers ever wise up.}
{172}{}{Pleasure doing business.}
{173}{}{Well don't hang around here, you moron! Somebody'll get suspicious.}
{174}{}{All right, I get the hint.}
{175}{}{What the fuck? Guards! We got an intruder!}
{176}{}{Go in there and I'll blow your head off. Understand?}
{177}{}{It's late and we're closed. Come back in the morning.}
{200}{}{Good work. One more thing though. You're a slaver, right? How 'bout you lend a hand and wipe out those safe houses for me. I could
 pay you for the job - say $1000.}
{201}{}{Good work. One more thing though. You look like a mean sonuvabith. How 'bout you wipe out those safe houses for me. There's a reward for it - say $1000.}
{202}{}{Visst.}
{203}{}{Not interested.}
{204}{}{Excellent. Here, let me mark these coordinates on your map thingy. Report back when you're done.}
{205}{}{Your loss. Now you best make yourself scarce, in case those Rangers ever wise up.}
{206}{}{Alright. Bye.}
{207}{}{Actually, do you think you could send some of your men along with me? It'd make things go a hell of a lot faster, and further guarantee success.}
{210}{}{You're back. Did you wipe out the Rangers' safe houses?}
{211}{}{Hell yeah I did. Piece of cake.}
{212}{}{Not yet. I'm still working on it.}
{215}{}{Really? Hot damn. This is the best news I've heard yet. This will be quite a blow to the Rangers. Good work. Here's your pay. Now you best make yourself scarce, the Rangers in town are sure to be looking for you.}
{216}{}{Let em look -- I'm not afraid. Thanks for the money.}
{217}{}{I better get out of town then. See you later.}
{218}{}{It seems everything I do manages to piss someone off. I'm used to it now. Bye.}
{220}{}{Hell no. I'm not rounding up any guys for this. If you feel you can't handle it, then leave.}
{221}{}{I never said I couldn't handle it. I just thought your men would like to join in on the fun. But whatever, I'll handle it on my own, no problem. I'll report back when I'm done.}
{222}{}{Fine, you can count me out, asshole. I'm not gonna be your dog. Bye.}
{223}{}{You calling me chicken? No one calls me that and lives!}
{225}{}{Well, alright. I think I can round up some boys to aid you in this. They'll meet you on the way. You ready to start
 now?}
{226}{}{Give me some time. I'll be back when I am ready.}
{227}{}{I was born ready. Let's rumble.}
{228}{}{I'm ready. Let's go.}
{229}{}{I think I'll pass on all this. I've lost interest. Bye.}
{230}{}{You ready for the raid, or are you here to waste more of my time?}
{231}{}{I need more time.}
{232}{}{I'm ready. Let's go.}
{240}{}{You wipe out the Rangers' safe houses. This deals quite a blow to the Rangers in their fight against slavery.}
{241}{}{I'm looking to buy some slaves.}
{250}{}{Well that's fuckin nice. We don't sell here. Metzger up north in the Den can help you with that.}
{251}{}{I've been there and his stock wasn't up to my standards.}
{252}{}{Seeing how I killed Metzger, I don't know how that's going to be useful to me. I think I'll kill you instead.}
{260}{}{Well aren't you a picky fuck. You do realize that his stock isn't limited to just the Den, right? He's got his own holding pen where slaves are dropped off.}
{261}{}{Interesting. How would I get to this other location?}
{270}{}{What, do you think you can get whatever the fuck you want for free? $1000. Take it or leave it.}
{271}{}{What, do you think you can get whatever the fuck you want for free? Plus, you ooze virtuousness. I don't like that. $2000. Take it or leave it.}
{272}{}{Alright, here.}
{273}{}{Det är inte viktigt.}
{274}{}{I'll do whatever I want. And I think I'll kill you now.}
{275}{}{I'll come back when I have more money.}
{280}{}{[He points on your map the location of the slaver camp.] It's around there. Now what else are you going to waste my time with?}
{281}{}{I've got what I need. Bye.}
