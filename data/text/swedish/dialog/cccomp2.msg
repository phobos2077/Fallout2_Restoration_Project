{100}{}{You see a tech.}
{101}{}{You see an Enclave technician.}
{102}{}{You see someone wearing a lab coat. He appears confident and self-assured.}
{103}{}{Yes, soldier?}
{104}{}{What this place?}
{105}{}{Me just say hi. Me go now.}
{106}{}{Vad är det här för ställe?}
{107}{}{Just saying hi. See ya.}
{108}{}{This is the computer room. That's the mainframe over there, the interface terminal is next to it, and these devices are the holotape data storage units. This is the latest and the greatest.}
{109}{}{Oh. Uh, what you do?}
{110}{}{So, what do you do here?}
{111}{}{I'm the senior computer analyst. I get to maintain all of the equipment here.}
{112}{}{Oh. Me use computer?}
{113}{}{Me no understand. Me go.}
{114}{}{Say, can I use the system for a minute? You know, check it out?}
{115}{}{Hey, nice talking to you. I'll see you later.}
{116}{}{Well... I'm not supposed to allow anyone other than trained personnel to use the equipment. It's all rather complex and delicate, you understand.}
{117}{}{Please? Me no break.}
{118}{}{I promise not to break it.}
{119}{}{Okej. Du kan komma åt systemet från terminalen där borta. Var bara försiktig, snälla. De skjuter oss båda om du skadar maskinen. Åh, gästlösenordet är 'Snookie.'}
{120}{}{I'm sorry but it's out of the question. I'm not even supposed to allow enlisted personnel in the room let alone allow them to use the equipment.}
{121}{}{Snookie? What is snookie?}
{122}{}{Ok. Me understand.}
{123}{}{Snookie? What the hell is a snookie?}
{124}{}{All right. I understand.}
{125}{}{'Snookie' is my girlfriend's nickname. I think it's cute. That's her out in the hall by the way. She's one of the guards.}
{126}{}{Ok, fine. Thanks.}
{127}{}{Yeah... cute. Thanks.}
{128}{}{You're out of uniform. }
{129}{}{You better suit up. Armory is down the hall on the left.}
{130}{}{You're taking a big chance being out of uniform. You better report to supply.}
{131}{}{Who the hell are you guys... Alert! Intruders!}
{132}{}{We've been infiltrated! Alert!}
{133}{}{Multiple intruders! Sound the alarm!}
{134}{}{Shit! Get the backups started.}
{135}{}{Shut down all classified operations.}
{136}{}{Säkra systemet och aktivera alla säkerhetslösenord.}
{137}{}{I'm a scientist, not a fighter!}
{138}{}{Pointy end with the laser diode goes toward the enemy. Then pull trigger.}
{139}{}{Help! Help! To the computer lab!}
