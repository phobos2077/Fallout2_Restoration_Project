{101}{}{Hello, Citizen.}
{102}{}{Wonderful day we're having, isn't it?}
{103}{}{That council meeting yesterday was very productive. We made lots

{104}{}{Can't wait to get back inside the walls.}
{105}{}{Good day, Citizen.}
{106}{}{Excuse me.}
{107}{}{You are in my way.}
{108}{}{Why don't you go back outside with the others?}
{109}{}{Can you keep a little distance, please?}
{110}{}{Just stay over there.}
{111}{}{You should be moving on.}
{112}{}{Get out of here.}
{113}{}{Be careful or I'll call the guards.}
{114}{}{I'm watching you.}
{115}{}{It's Outworlders like you...}
