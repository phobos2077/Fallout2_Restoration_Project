{100}{}{You see a man in metal armor.}
{101}{}{You see Matthew.}
{102}{}{You see a man wearing metal armor with a lightning bolt insignia on it.}
{103}{}{Hello,}
{104}{}{. What can I do for you?}
{105}{}{You answer questions?}
{106}{}{Nothing. Me come back later.}
{107}{}{You can start by answering some questions.}
{108}{}{Nothing for now. I'll come back later.}
{109}{}{I think you deserve to have answers to your questions.}
{110}{}{What can I help you with?}
{111}{}{Who you guys?}
{112}{}{Why nobody mention you?}
{113}{}{Why only one person here?}
{114}{}{Jag gå nu.}
{115}{}{Who are you guys?}
{116}{}{Why is it that nobody around here mentions you?}
{117}{}{Why do you have only one person here?}
{118}{}{I've got to go.}
{119}{}{We are a paramilitary organization known as the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{120}{}{What Brotherhood do?}
{121}{}{Okay - and what is it that you do?}
{122}{}{At one time we were the sole bastions of technology left on the planet. We set ourselves up as what could best be called 'technology police.' We hoarded the old knowledge and only doled it out in small parcels. Of course, it was only to those who we felt deserved it and had the wisdom to properly use it.}
{123}{}{And now?}
{124}{}{You said 'at one time.' What about now?}
{125}{}{Several months ago we came across a group known as the Enclave. Much to our surprise their level of technology surpassed even our own. We found this quite disturbing and considered contacting them. However, we decided on a more cautious course of action until we could determine exactly who the Enclave was, and the underlying purpose of their organization.}
{126}{}{To this end, we have reactivated small outposts near areas of Enclave activity from which we can safely observe them. Currently, we have activated such outposts in the Den, the NCR, and here in San Francisco.}
{127}{}{What you learn?}
{128}{}{Sounds interesting. What have you learned?}
{129}{}{We have found that the Enclave deals heavily in drugs, weapons, and slaves. However, these are simply trivial pursuits leading up to some higher purpose, which we have failed to uncover. We are still watching them.}
{130}{}{Why you tell all this now?}
{131}{}{Before we go any further, why tell me all this now?}
{132}{}{(sigh) The Enclave has developed vertibird technology, flying machines that allow them to move deeply into surrounding territories. Without similar technology to counter this threat, the Brotherhood would be unable to stop an invasion launched by the Enclave. We need to have vertibird technology, or a viable counter to it, for ourselves.}
{133}{}{Now, recently the Enclave established a base north of here called Navarro. It's used as a stopover point for the maintenance and refueling of vertibirds. It's my belief that such a base may have complete technical plans of the vertibirds. All I need is for someone to infiltrate the base, steal the plans, and bring them here to me.}
{134}{}{Uh... me do?}
{135}{}{Let me guess. You want me to infiltrate this base for you.}
{136}{}{Let me be frank with you,}
{137}{}{. The Brotherhood of Steel is not the power that we once were. We believed ourselves to be the sole source of technology left to mankind. Secure in this belief we have let our order decline over the years. Now we don't have the resources at our disposal to deal with the Enclave. We need your help.}
{138}{}{I am prepared to make you this offer. Perform this mission for me and I will grant you access to our facility here. The best of the Brotherhood technology will be made available to you, exclusively. What do you say?}
{139}{}{Me think about.}
{140}{}{No way. Me be going.}
{141}{}{What the hell. Me do.}
{142}{}{I'll think about it.}
{143}{}{No way. Find yourself a new chump.}
{144}{}{What the hell. I must be crazy, but I'll do it.}
{145}{}{Fair enough. Come back to me when you reach a decision.}
{146}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{147}{}{Okay, but me ask more.}
{148}{}{All right. I'll see ya.}
{149}{}{All right, but I'd like to ask you a few more things.}
{150}{}{I understand your hesitation in accepting such a mission. If you change your mind please let me know.}
{151}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{152}{}{Okay, but me ask more.}
{153}{}{All right. I'll see ya.}
{154}{}{All right, but I'd like to ask you a few more things.}
{155}{}{Excellent. Here is what I need you to do. Go to Navarro, infiltrate the base, and recover the technical plans for the vertibirds. Return the plans to me.}
{156}{}{Okay. Uh... How you think me can do this? It military base.}
{157}{}{Okay. Me go now.}
{158}{}{All right, but... Just how do think I should go about this? This is a military base after all.}
{159}{}{Fine. I'll get on it.}
{160}{}{Upon successful completion of your mission I will grant you access to our facility here. In the meantime it would be best if you got started immediately. Thank you,}
{161}{}{.}
{162}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{163}{}{Sure, but me ask more.}
{164}{}{Yeah, I'll see ya.}
{165}{}{Sure thing, but I'd like to ask you a few more things.}
{166}{}{We've had this base for years. By maintaining it at a low level with minimal staffing, never drawing attention to ourselves, we've achieved anonymity. We leave the Shi alone, and they leave us alone.}
{167}{}{Me guess...}
{168}{}{Yeah, I guess I see what you mean.}
{169}{}{Too many people in any one place can attract attention. One man in a city of many men is less noticeable.}
{170}{}{Okej.}
{171}{}{Hello again. Is there something I can help you with?}
{172}{}{No, just say hi.}
{173}{}{Yes. You answer question?}
{174}{}{No, just dropping by.}
{175}{}{Yeah, answer some questions for me.}
{176}{}{Hello. Have you thought about my offer?}
{177}{}{No. Me not think yet.}
{178}{}{Yes. Me take job.}
{179}{}{No, not yet.}
{180}{}{Yeah, I think I'll take the job.}
{181}{}{Hello. Have you changed your mind about my offer?}
{182}{}{Nej.}
{183}{}{Yes. Me take.}
{184}{}{No, I haven't.}
{185}{}{Yes, I'll take the job.}
{186}{}{Have you completed your mission?}
{187}{}{No, me still work on it.}
{188}{}{Me get plans.}
{189}{}{No, I'm still working on it.}
{190}{}{I got the vertibird plans for you.}
{191}{}{Well, keep working on it. I know it's a difficult mission, but I think you can pull it off.}
{192}{}{Okej.}
{193}{}{Excellent work! Let me have the plans, and I'll make a copy of them. As promised, I'll give you full access to our facilities. Thank you.}
{194}{}{You welcome.}
{195}{}{You're welcome.}
{196}{}{Navarro is relatively new and not fully staffed as yet. My sources tell me that they receive new recruits from time to time. Perhaps you could pose as a new arrival. I would suggest that.}
{197}{}{Navarro is relatively new and not fully staffed as yet. My sources tell me that they receive new recruits from time to time. Perhaps, if you went in alone, you could pose as a new arrival. I would suggest that. You could have your friends wait here.}
{198}{}{Okej.}
{199}{}{You say you 'sources.' What they be?}
{200}{}{All right.}
{201}{}{You mentioned your 'sources.' Who would they be?}
{202}{}{I had an operative go and scout the base. Her reports recently stopped; I can only assume the worst. Please be careful}
{203}{}{. I don't enjoy sending people to their deaths.}
{204}{}{Me be careful, thanks.}
{205}{}{I'll be careful. Thanks.}
{206}{}{Thanks again for all your help. You have full access to our facilities now.}
{207}{}{That is a private office.}
{208}{}{There is nothing for you in there.}
{209}{}{This is private property, so move along.}
{210}{}{How do you know who I am?}
{211}{}{How know me?}
{212}{}{We know many things.}
{213}{}{Upon successful completion of your mission I'll get the tanker ready for you, and grant you access to our facility here. In the meantime it would be best if you got started immediately. Thank you,}
{214}{}{We'come.}
{215}{}{Excellent work! Let me have the plans, and I'll make a copy of them. As promised, I'll ensure that the tanker is ready for you to take out to the oil rig - just go to the computer on the upper level and hit the Go switch. I'll also give you full access to our facilities. Thank you.}
{216}{}{You we'come!}
{217}{}{Just head on in through the door there, if you like, or go on up to the tanker. It's ready to go. Good luck!}
{218}{}{So I am prepared to make you this offer. Perform this mission for me and I will prepare the tanker for you on your journey to the Enclave. What do you say?}
{219}{}{Me think about.}
{220}{}{No way. Me be going.}
{221}{}{What the hell. Me do.}
{222}{}{Okay. Go now.}
