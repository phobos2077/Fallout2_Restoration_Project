{100}{}{You see a large, mangy, buff colored dog with a feral look to it.}
{101}{}{You see a dusty, yellowish-buff colored, dog.}
{110}{}{Grrrrrr. Woof! Woof! Grrrrrr...}
{111}{}{Woof, Arf, Arf?}
{112}{}{(Staring into dog's eyes) Grrrr! Arrrrrgh! Grrrrrrrr!}
{113}{}{Hmm, I bet you sound angry because you want something.}
{114}{}{You're just hungry, aren't you, boy? Let me see if I have some delicious drymeat to
 give you.}
{120}{}{Woof! (Dog leaps forward with teeth bared -- snatches jerky from your outstretched hand -- eats
 jerky noisily)}
{121}{}{Woof! (The mongrel happily grabs the yummy drymeat, dropping a key that he must have had in his
 mouth -- you pick up the key.)}
{122}{}{Mmm, jerky.}
{123}{}{Ah, poor boy, you must have been hungry. (Patting dog on head)}
{130}{}{Grrr. Woof! Woof!}
{131}{}{Arf-arf doggy. Heh, heh.}
{132}{}{Bye, doggy.}
{133}{}{Sorry, no doggy treats for you today.}
{134}{}{Shoo! Get out of here, you damn mutt.}
{140}{}{Woof, woof. Woof-woof!}
{141}{}{Woof, woof? Eru?}
{142}{}{Good doggy, good boy.}
{143}{}{You're hungry, aren't you, boy? I bet you'd like some delicious drymeat, wouldn't you?
 Let's see if I have some. }
{200}{}{Woof! (pant, pant, pant -- Slurp!)}
{201}{}{Woof-woof!}
{202}{}{Arf!}
{203}{}{Arf, arf, arf!}
{204}{}{(Stares at you lovingly)}
{205}{}{Voff!}
