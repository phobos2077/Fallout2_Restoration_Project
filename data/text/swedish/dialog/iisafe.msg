{100}{}{You see a huge black iron safe.}
{101}{}{You see a black square thing with a big nose.}
{200}{}{You see a huge black metal square thing with a nose on the front.}
{201}{}{You see a huge black iron safe that looks way too heavy to move. There's a combination dial on the front.}
{202}{}{Ullo box me }
{203}{}{ Hoo you?}
{204}{}{Twist its nose}
{205}{}{Wander off}
{206}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on these three dog tags can open the safe...}
{207}{}{Spin the dial, listen for clicking noises.}
{208}{}{Spin the dial randomly.}
{209}{}{Examine the safe for traps.}
{210}{}{Leave the safe alone.}
{220}{}{There is a KER-KLANK. The safe is now unlocked.}
{221}{}{The safe is unlocked.}
{222}{}{The nose turns in your hand! It looks like you could pull open the face if you wanted to.}
{223}{}{The big metal square thing looks like it can be opened.}
{224}{}{Open the face}
{225}{}{Wander off}
{226}{}{Loot the safe.}
{227}{}{Leave the safe alone.}
{235}{}{Close inspection of the safe reveals a black wire running into the dirt just beneath the safe. Brushing away the dirt, you discover that the fuse runs to a stick of dynamite with a timer on it.}
{236}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on the three dog tags can open the safe...}
{237}{}{Try and disarm the trap.}
{238}{}{Leave the safe alone.}
{250}{}{You turn the dial slowly for several minutes, but you can't make out anything.}
{251}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on these three dog tags can open the safe...}
{252}{}{Spin the dial, listen for clicking noises.}
{253}{}{Spin the dial randomly.}
{254}{}{Leave the safe alone.}
{275}{}{You don't find any traps on the safe.}
{276}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on the three dog tags can open the safe...}
{277}{}{Spin the dial, listen for clicking noises.}
{278}{}{Spin the dial randomly.}
{279}{}{Examine the safe for traps again.}
{280}{}{Leave the safe alone.}
{290}{}{You are turning the knob... when suddenly there is a KER-KLANK. The safe is now unlocked!}
{291}{}{You are spinning the dial randomly, when suddenly the dial catches on a number... there is a KER-KLANK. The safe
 is now unlocked!}
{292}{}{Hullo? Hulllooo? Anbody hoome?}
{293}{}{Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen...}
{294}{}{Yeah, I have the touch...}
{305}{}{You turn the knob, but the tiny door won't open!}
{306}{}{You spin the dial for several minutes, and nothing happens.}
{307}{}{Hulllooo? Hulllo box...}
{308}{}{Keep twisting its nose.}
{309}{}{Wander off}
{310}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe the numbers on these three dog tags can open the safe...}
{311}{}{Spin the dial, listen for clicking noises.}
{312}{}{Keep spinning the dial randomly.}
{313}{}{Leave the safe alone.}
{320}{}{The thing doesn't answer.}
{321}{}{The black square cube thing doesn't seem to notice you.}
{322}{}{The metal box ignores you.}
{323}{}{Helloooooo? Me }
{324}{}{ Hoo yoo?}
{325}{}{Twist its nose}
{326}{}{Wander off}
{340}{}{With surgical precision, you disarm the fuse and pull the dynamite from beneath the dirt. The trap is now disarmed.}
{341}{}{Now to crack this safe...}
{342}{}{Leave the safe alone.}
{343}{}{You don't have time to try the safe during combat.}
{344}{}{You have cracked the raiders' safe.}
