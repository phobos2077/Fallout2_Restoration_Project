{100}{}{You see a powerfully-built super-mutant. He looks bored.}
{101}{}{You see Francis, the mutant arm wrestler.}
{102}{}{You see a powerfully built super-mutant. He is clad in black leather, and boredom is written
 across his face.}
{103}{}{Help you out with something?}
{104}{}{Ook! Ook! Eep orp ook!}
{105}{}{Hoo you?}
{106}{}{Hey, buddy. Who are you?}
{107}{}{What's there to do in this place?}
{108}{}{Are you up for an arm-wrestle, Mr. Iron-Pecs?}
{109}{}{Pal, I've got no idea what you're trying to say. Sorry.}
{110}{}{I'm Francis. I'm the arm-wrestling champ of this town. I've got a running bet that no one can
 beat me.}
{111}{}{I'm Francis, remember? The arm-wrestling champion of the town? I've got a running bet that no one can
 beat me.}
{112}{}{I beat you! Me! Me!}
{113}{}{I'll bet you haven't had many takers.}
{114}{}{I'll bet I could.}
{115}{}{That good, huh?}
{116}{}{What's to do in town? Well, let's see... there's the saloon, the mines, the refinery, and the
 caravan. We haven't got much time for fun here, and what we do have, we generally devote to drinking.
 Also, we work on human/mutant relations.}
{117}{}{How... exciting.}
{118}{}{All right, thanks.}
{119}{}{Human/mutant relations? What do you mean?}
{120}{}{I'm always ready. You wanna go?}
{121}{}{No, I'm just asking for my health.}
{122}{}{Umm, no.}
{123}{}{Of course I do.}
{124}{}{[he sizes you up and gauges your musculature] I don't think so, pal. It'd just be a waste of my time. Piss off.}
{125}{}{You think you can take me, eh? All right. You win, you get this power fist. I win, and you're
 my gimp for a night. Do you want to do it now, or would you like to take some time to rest up?}
{126}{}{Rest! Rest!}
{127}{}{Now. We now!}
{128}{}{I'd like to rest up first.}
{129}{}{I'm game for it now.}
{130}{}{I changed my mind. I don't want to wrestle you.}
{131}{}{That's the truth. Looks like there's no one in this whole godforsaken wasteland who'll go for it,
 either.}
{132}{}{Pity, that. If I find anyone, I'll send them your way. Bye.}
{133}{}{Just because you're strong doesn't mean you're smart, pal. Remember that.}
{134}{}{Buddy, if you don't like it here, there's a whole world outside.}
{135}{}{No problem. Anything else you need, feel free to ask Phil the bartender or someone else.}
{136}{}{Buddy, do you want to arm-wrestle or not? I haven't got the time to waste with snotty remarks
 and cowards.}
{137}{}{Yeah, sure. Let's do it.}
{138}{}{No, I don't think so.}
{139}{}{You come on back and find me when you're ready, then. I should be around.}
{140}{}{Get out of here before my stupid brain decides to beat your face in.}
{141}{}{Backing out, eh? Coward. I figured as much.}
{142}{}{All right, all right, I'll do it.}
{143}{}{Yeah, whatever. See ya.}
{144}{}{Well, pal, that's the first time anyone's ever beaten me in a fair contest. You win. Take this.
 Well done.}
{145}{}{You lost. No big surprise. Time to come on home with me.}
{146}{}{I tell you what, buddy, I ain't seen an arm like that in ages. You use that right, you'll go
 far. Enjoy the glove!}
{147}{}{Didn't you get enough of me before? Do you want to try again? Same deal?}
{148}{}{Yeah, let's do it.}
{149}{}{No, sorry.}
{150}{}{I've heard about you. I don't associate with scum.}
{151}{}{Buddy, thanks for stepping in to save our town. Let me buy you a drink.}
{152}{}{Howdy, hero!}
{153}{}{Scum! Die!}
{154}{}{You may've noticed that we got both mutants and humans in the city. We're trying to work it so
 that we all live in peace. Unfortunately, there are some who want to destroy that. Our leader, Marcus,
 helped found the city. Do you want to hear more?}
{155}{}{Yeah, tell me more.}
{156}{}{No, not really.}
{157}{}{Frankly, I think you mutants are scum and these humans are traitors for working with you.}
{158}{}{Sometimes I worry about the people here... it's too hard for some of them to get past their
 fear. Word has it there's a shit storm coming down the pike - but that might just be rumor.}
{159}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{160}{}{All right. Well, if you need any more information, you know where to find me.}
{161}{}{Sure. Thanks. Bye.}
{162}{}{Really? That's a fascinating attitude. Too bad we didn't crush your village when we controlled
 the wasteland. Get out of my sight, worm.}
{200}{}{[KLAR]}
{201}{}{Hej d√•.}
{202}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{203}{}{[MER]}
{204}{}{Sure. Thanks. Bye.}
{300}{}{Pal, I don't think you'd know how to use what I've got to offer. Come back when you've got a
 little more experience under your belt.}
{301}{}{You see a powerfully-built super-mutant. He is clad in black leather, and boredom is written
 across his face. He seems to have a massive gauntlet of some sort poking out of his pouch.}
{302}{}{You feel sore. You seem to be carrying a memento of your visit with Francis.}
{400}{}{Urrggghh!}
{401}{}{Arrrrr!}
{402}{}{Aiiigggggg.}
{403}{}{Rnnrnrnrnnrrr.}
{404}{}{Hagggahhhaaaggga.}
{405}{}{Hominahominahomina.}
{406}{}{Eeeeeccchhhh.}
{407}{}{Grunt!}
{408}{}{Groan!}
{409}{}{Ouchie!}
{410}{}{Ow! My arm!}
{411}{}{Ha ha! Gotcha!}
{500}{}{Over the top, Francis! Over the top!}
{501}{}{Man, that's what I call an ARMs race! Hahahah!}
{502}{}{Geez, you guys should join the ARMy. Har Har Har!}
{503}{}{I gotta HAND it to you, friend. You're WRISTing your life trying to beat Francis!}
{504}{}{Ouch! Right in the metacarpals!}
{505}{}{Hey, Francis! You should TRICEP-arating the arm from the shoulder.}
{506}{}{This fight sure is HUMERUS! Guffaw Guffaw!}
{507}{}{Use your clavicle, Francis! Use your clavicle!}
{508}{}{Uh oh... I'd better get out of 'ARM's way! Ha ha ha!}
{509}{}{Look at them biceps go!}
{510}{}{I think I hear a tendon getting ready to pop...}
{511}{}{You know, a simple calculation of mass ratio would seem to favor Francis.}
{512}{}{Francis! Fran-CIS! FRAN-CIS!}
{513}{}{Lick 'em, Francis! No, not with your tongue!}
{530}{}{All right Francis! You sure SHOULD-ER!}
{531}{}{Way to go Francis!}
{532}{}{Whoa! I've never seen that happen before!}
{599}{}{I found a note in the tunnels with the names Francis and Zaius on it. Looks like you've been committing some crimes.}
{600}{}{Damn it. Zaius left notes lying out again, eh? Well, human, let me tell you this: I
 knew there are people trying to kill mutants in this town, and I knew that Marcus would only
 arrest them with evidence. I just wanted to make it happen with as little bloodshed as possible.}
{601}{}{So you killed innocents, huh?}
{602}{}{Sure. So what do you propose to do about it?}
{603}{}{Innocents? Ha! The people I killed were trying to kill ME! I just returned the favor
  and made sure their deaths served another purpose - one that might further the cause of peace.}
{604}{}{But this way you're still nothing more than a criminal and a murderer - and I only
 have your word that there's a conspiracy.}
{605}{}{The only thing that'll satisfy the cause of peace is for all the murderers to die.
 And I'm going to do my part by killing you.}
{606}{}{If you talked to some of the people in town about your hatred of mutants,
  you'd find out about the conspiracy. I know two wrongs don't make a right, but I call it self-defense.
 I did something wrong, and I admit it. I can't stay here. I'll set out to find a way to atone for my actions...
 That satisfy your sense of justice?}
{607}{}{It'll have to.}
{608}{}{No, it doesn't. I'm going to kill you myself.}
{700}{}{You beat Francis at armwrestling.}
{701}{}{You confronted Francis about the note to Zaius.}
{800}{}{(Looking at the massive mutant, you realize you wouldn't have
 stood a chance. Time to walk away while you've still got your dignity.)}
