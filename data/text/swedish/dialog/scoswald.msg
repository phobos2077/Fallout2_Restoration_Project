{100}{}{You see a man in dirty, blood-stained clothes.}
{101}{}{It's the squatter prisoner they've caught.}
{102}{}{His face and arms have a cross hatch of old knife scars and there's a crazed look in his eyes that says he's a brawler and an outlaw.}
{103}{}{You're wasting your time. I ain't got word one to say to you or anybody else.}
{104}{}{Go away and leave me alone, pig.}
{105}{}{Does it suddenly smell bad in here?}
{106}{}{What are you gonna do - scare me into talking?}
{107}{}{You don't scare me.}
{108}{}{Why don't you just kiss my boots? }
{109}{}{What the hell? You're trying to kill me! Guard!}
{110}{}{Talk or me kill you.}
{111}{}{Ain't nobody coming to help you. If you want to live, you talk.}
{112}{}{Okay, okay! What do you want to know? Just don't hurt me again.}
{113}{}{Vault 15 - you tell.}
{114}{}{What do you know about Vault 15?}
{115}{}{Look, I'm just a guy, not the guy in charge - that's Darion. He's the one you want. He's got this thing about Shady Sands and that old bitch Tandi. He's got a hideout in Vault 15, even got the locals thinking he's on their side. That's all I know. Honest!}
{116}{}{Really, I don't know anything else! I told you everything I know, really! Don't hurt me anymore.}
{117}{}{No way! I'm not falling for this trick. BANG! -- shot down while escaping. Forget it!}
