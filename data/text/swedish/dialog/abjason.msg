{100}{}{You see a bespectacled young monk.}
{101}{}{You see Brother Jason.}
{102}{}{This monk seems to be brooding.}
{200}{}{[The young monk quickly pockets a deck of "Tragic" cards as you approach.] What do you want?}
{201}{}{Nothing from you. Bye.}
{202}{}{I want to know why you just hid that card deck from me.}
{210}{}{I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have any card deck.}
{211}{}{Don't lie to me. I saw you put it away in your pocket. I just wanted to know why.}
{212}{}{Alright, whatever you say. See ya.}
{220}{}{Look, don't tell anyone, alright? We're not suppose to "use" pre-war relics, just worship them. But these Tragic
 cards are so damn cool. [He seems to get lost in another world as he gazes lovingly at the deck. After a moment,
 he looks up at you.] Oh, sorry. I'm Brother Jason by the way. I, uh, don't suppose you play Tragic?}
{221}{}{BRING FORTH THE GARNERING!!!}
{222}{}{Hell yeah, I love Tragic the Garnering.}
{223}{}{I've tried it, but it's not for me.}
{224}{}{I used to be addicted as hell to that game. I try to stay away from it now.}
{225}{}{Nepp.}
{226}{}{Hell no. Do I look like a pathetic loser to you?}
{230}{}{Hey, fuck you asshole. Just leave me alone.}
{231}{}{Hey, fuck you whore. Just leave me alone.}
{232}{}{I'd love to, but I'm overcome with a desire to do you great bodily harm.}
{233}{}{Alright, fine. Bye.}
{234}{}{Look, I'm sorry. That was rude of me. I'm just not a fan of Tragic.}
{240}{}{Ah man, I'd love to play against you, but it's too risky. I don't want these taken from me. That's what I hate
 about this place. We're sitting on a damn goldmine of awesome things from before the war, but we're forbidding ourselves
 from indulging in it. It doesn't make any sense. It's fucking moronic.}
{241}{}{Ah man, I know what you mean. I wish I could play more myself, but it's too risky. I don't want these taken from me.
 That's what I hate about this place. We're sitting on a damn goldmine of awesome things from before the war, but we're
 forbidding ourselves from indulging in it. It doesn't make any sense. It's fucking moronic.}
{242}{}{[He chuckles.] We got an addict on our hands here, I see. I wish I could play more myself, but it's too risky.
 I don't want these taken from me. That's what I hate about this place. We're sitting on a damn goldmine of awesome things
 from before the war, but we're forbidding ourselves from indulging in it. It doesn't make any sense. It's fucking moronic.}
{243}{}{It doesn't matter, we wouldn't be able to play anyway -- it's too risky. I don't want these taken from me. That's what
 I hate about this place. We're sitting on a damn goldmine of awesome things from before the war, but we're forbidding ourselves
 from indulging in it. It doesn't make any sense. It's fucking moronic.}
{244}{}{Yeah, that does sound stupid.}
{245}{}{If you don't agree with the ideals of your order, then why are you a monk?}
{250}{}{You think I *chose* to be a monk? I was born into this shitty lifestyle. I just wish the others would wake up and
 see how stupid it is to not take advantage of all this sweet stuff we've collected. But no, they're perfectly content to
 worship and catalog the relics, but never actually do anything useful with them. Like I said, it's fucking moronic.}
{251}{}{You got a point, that does sound pretty stupid.}
{252}{}{About as moronic as me sitting here listening to you bitch about your life. Bye.}
{253}{}{If you think it's so stupid, then why don't you do something to try and change things?}
{260}{}{Finally, someone who agrees with me! Look, I have this idea, and maybe you could help me out. You see, the monks
 here have spent *years* transcribing pre-war information into our computer database. If someone were to "accidentally"
 format the database, they'd lose all that work. I think something like that might shock them back to their senses and we
 might finally give up this stupid way of life. So, what do you say?}
{261}{}{I say that's a terrible idea and that I'm done talking to you.}
{262}{}{Erase years of someone else's hard work? Sounds fun. I'll do it.}
{263}{}{Why don't you format it yourself?}
{264}{}{If you hate it here, why don't you just leave?}
{270}{}{Actually, I *do* have an idea of how to change things. Maybe you could help me out. You see, the monks here have
 spent *years* transcribing pre-war information into our computer database. If someone were to "accidentally" format the
 database, they'd lose all that work. I think something like that might shock them back to their senses and we might finally
 give up this stupid way of life. So, what do you say?}
{271}{}{I say that's a terrible idea and that I'm done talking to you.}
{272}{}{Radera hundratals år av någon annans hårda arbete? Låter kul. Jag gör det.}
{273}{}{Why don't you format it yourself?}
{274}{}{If you hate it here, why don't you just leave?}
{280}{}{Are you kidding me? They'd crucify me if I did that. You however, you're an experienced adventurer. Hell, I bet
 you could massacre everyone here without breaking a sweat. So will you do it, or are you afraid of a bunch of pacifist monks?}
{281}{}{I'm not afraid of anyone. I'll do it.}
{282}{}{Alright. I'll do it.}
{283}{}{Nah, instead I think I'll test out your massacre theory. Starting with you.}
{284}{}{I'll pass. That's just not my style. Bye.}
{285}{}{No, I'm not going to do it. If you hate it here, why don't you just leave?}
{286}{}{Unless you've changed your mind about helping me, fuck off.}
{287}{}{Alright. I'll do it.}
{288}{}{No, I'm not going to do it. If you hate it here, why don't you just leave?}
{290}{}{You will? Seriously? Oh man, that's awesome. But first, you'll need to get access, 'cause they're pretty protective
 of the database. It shouldn't be too hard though, these monks are pretty trusting. They're gonna be pissed as hell when
 you format it, but they're all a bunch of wimps, so don't worry about it. Just try not to kill anyone -- I don't want things
 to get too out of hand, you know?}
{291}{}{Sure. Anything else?}
{292}{}{I make no promises. Anything else?}
{300}{}{Just format it, then take off, cause they're not going to want you around here. Don't even bother to come tell me
 you did it, because I'll have to act just as pissed as everyone else or they'll suspect something's up. Thanks again for
 doing this. It's for their own good.}
{301}{}{Whatever you say. Bye.}
{310}{}{Are you crazy? I've never been out in the wastes, but I've got a pretty damn good idea as to what it's like. I'd
 be lucky to make if fifty yards before a radscorpion shoved a foot-long stinger up my ass. Or even worse, I'd get captured
 and tortured by a gang of maniac raiders *or* I'd be eaten alive by cannibalistic tribals. Whatever. I just know that if
 I left here, I'd be fucked. So no, I'm stuck here.}
{311}{}{Hey, it's not *that* bad out there... Actually, you're right. You probably wouldn't even make it to Gecko.
 At least, not without help. But what if I said I'd escort you?}
{312}{}{Sucks to be you. Bye.}
{313}{}{Keep your hopes up. I'm sure there is a town nearby that would be safe to travel to.}
{315}{}{Yeah, well if you find one, let me know.}
{316}{}{Will do. Bye.}
{320}{}{To Gecko? That's the ghoul town, right? Thanks, but no thanks.}
{321}{}{Hey, the ghouls there are actually really friendly. Besides, I know one in particular that loves a good game of Tragic.}
{322}{}{Hey, the ghouls there are actually really friendly.}
{323}{}{Hey, I hear the ghouls there are actually really friendly.}
{324}{}{Alright. Suit yourself. Bye.}
{330}{}{No shit, another Tragic player? Hmm, that kind of changes things... I wonder if he'd have a Black Dahlia to
 trade. Alright. I'll go if you'll escort me.}
{331}{}{Lets go.}
{332}{}{Alright, but I need to take care of some things first. I'll let you know when I'm ready to go.}
{340}{}{Oh yeah? That doesn't change the fact that they look like brahmin shit. No thanks.}
{341}{}{Alright. Suit yourself. Bye.}
{350}{}{What do you want?}
{351}{}{I just wanted to say hi. See ya.}
{352}{}{I changed my mind. I'll format the computer for you.}
{353}{}{Hey, you might want to reconsider my offer to take you to Gecko, because I know
 someone there that loves a good game of Tragic.}
{354}{}{Hey, I know someone in Gecko that loves a good game of Tragic. I could take you there.}
{360}{}{Are we ready to go yet? I'm dying to know what kind of Tragic cards this guy's got.}
{361}{}{Alright, let's go.}
{362}{}{Not yet. I'll let you know.}
{370}{}{[Upon arriving in Gecko you introduce the young monk to Wooz. They quickly hit it off and begin comparing their
 Tragic card decks. You're about to leave when Brother Jason pulls himself away from Tragic long enough to have a word with you.]}
{371}{}{[MER]}
{372}{}{Holy shit, Wooz *does* have a Black Dahlia! That alone has made this trip worthwhile. Sure, the ghouls are ugly
 as hell, but I found if I take off my glasses, then they're kinda tolerable. Anyway, thanks a lot for bringing me. Here,
 I, uh, "borrowed" this from the Abbey's Memorabilia, amazingly it's one of the few tech relics that still works.
 [He hands you a Stealth Boy.] See ya.}
{373}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{374}{}{I'm just happy I won't have to hear you bitch anymore. Bye.}
{380}{}{Holy shit, Wooz *does* have a Black Dahlia! That alone has made this trip worthwhile. Sure, the ghouls are ugly
 as hell, but I found if I take off my glasses, then they're kinda tolerable. Anyway, thanks a lot for bringing me here.
 Here, [He reaches into his pocket, then frowns.] what the hell? I could swear I had it. Uh, sorry, but looks like I misplaced
 your reward, so you'll have to make due with a simple thanks. See ya.}
{381}{}{Oh, uh, don't worry about it. Just glad I could help. Bye.}
{382}{}{I'm just happy I won't have to hear you bitch anymore. Bye.}
{400}{}{Can't talk... must build more powerful deck...}
{500}{}{Leave me alone.}
{501}{}{Go away.}
{502}{}{Fuck off.}
{600}{}{Oh, hey, it's you. Somebody blew up the reactor at Gecko and all the ghouls left. No reason for me to stay there,
 so I left and came back here. Luckily for me the monks here didn't question my absence, so I'm not in any trouble for leaving.
 This sucks though, I thought I was going to have a new life doing what I love. [He sighs deeply]}
{601}{}{Sorry to hear that. See you around.}
{602}{}{That's life. One minute you're on top of the world and the next instant you're face down in the mud. Live and learn. Bye.}
{610}{}{Guess I just gotta get used to this place.}
{1000}{}{You safely escort Brother Jason to his new home.}
