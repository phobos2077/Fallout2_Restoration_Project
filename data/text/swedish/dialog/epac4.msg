{100}{}{You see a Hologram.}
{101}{}{You see the The Director of Security.}
{102}{}{Hologram 10001. He oversees the EPA's security.}
{200}{}{Halt! Do not attempt to come any closer. Identify yourself, intruder.}
{201}{}{I'm the Chosen One of Arroyo. I'm exploring the EPA.}
{202}{}{I'm not an intruder and now I need to be leaving.}
{203}{}{Jag är }
{204}{}{, and I'm not trying to intrude, I'm just exploring.}
{210}{}{Exploring!? Exploring... MY... EPA!? How dare you have the audacity to break in here and just casually wander around! Vollidiot! I have a half a mind to arrest you and toss your ass in the petting zoo -- give them freakshows a real feast!}
{211}{}{No, wait! I'm not doing you any harm! Let me explain...}
{220}{}{You aren't going anywhere fast, Pisskopf. Nobody saunters into MY EPA without explaining themselves. How do I know you're not a Chinese spy?}
{221}{}{I guess you don't. But if you give me a chance to explain myself, I'm sure we can sort this whole mess out.}
{222}{}{So what if I am? Does it even matter? Your precious EPA isn't exactly relevant anymore. It's just another decaying relic of a lost age.}
{230}{}{Go on then, Schwachkopf, explain yourself. Make it good though, or I'll have the robots beat you and drag you down to the electric chair!}
{231}{}{Alright. First off, I'm not a Chinese spy -- I'm what you might call a tribal. I've been chosen to embark on a perilous quest so that I might save my tribe from destruction. I only entered this complex in hope of scavenging something that could aid me in my quest.}
{232}{}{Fuck off. Seriously, you're a *hologram*. The worst you can do is try and shout me to death, which you seem to be giving your best shot. As for those scrap heaps you call robots, I might be a little more intimidated if I saw any around here that actually work.}
{240}{}{Scavenge! You Pissnelke! How dare you discredit the name of the EPA in this way! Nobody so much as removes a piece of paper from this building without my say so! However, to have entered this far into the EPA would require some skill... perhaps I could find a use for you after all. }
{241}{}{Vadå?}
{242}{}{No, I think I'll just scavenge some more and go. Bye!}
{250}{}{Insolence! Such insolence from a Blödes Arschloch! When I began my training, insolence was to be punished. And punished we were! Mark my words scheisskopf, that forked tongue of yours will one day be the death of you.}
{251}{}{Maybe it will, maybe it will. And if that day were ever to come, I shall deal with it then and there. What is certain, is it will not come from you. You're a nobody. You have nothing left to rule over, which is why you cover up your sadness with anger. How long have the robots failed to respond to you?}
{260}{}{Well, as you may already have guessed, the robots no longer work here at the EPA. The computer consoles no longer register my verbal commands and I don't have a body to activate the console. I... I can't properly secure anything. Could you fix the robot control computer for me? I need the ability to command the robots for... well, for things.}
{261}{}{Well why not? I'll see what I can do.}
{262}{}{No, I don't have the time. Bye.}
{270}{}{Fick dich du verdammter Arschficker! I ought to... to... [He sighs.] You're right. The robots can't understand what I say anymore. They sit there motionless like damn penners! The computers have ceased functioning and, as a hologram, I can't touch the keyboards. As I've been saying for many years now, this whole place needs leveling and rebuilding. Maybe one day I'll have the power to do just that.}
{271}{}{Maybe I could help you somehow? I'm pretty good with computers.}
{280}{}{Thanks. If you can repair the robot control computer, I'll grant you full access to the security wing on the red level. You can take what you like from the stores. I'm afraid we have no use for them now anyway.}
{281}{}{Thanks. I'll get back to you when I'm done.}
{290}{}{Lech mich! I have nothing more to say to you.}
{291}{}{Bra.}
{300}{}{Have you managed to complete the task yet? *Eyes gleam expectantly*}
{301}{}{No, not yet. I'll keep working on it.}
{310}{}{Are the computers back online yet?}
{311}{}{Yes. I've repaired them for you. You can command the robots again.}
{320}{}{Excellent! Brilliant! I can crush those fools now! The EPA will be cleansed once more! Alright, now I have something for you. [Speaking to the robots] Get yer metal ass in gear and come give this civie a reward for serving this great nation!
 [A robot wheels over to you and holds out a keycard. Once you take the card, you watch it wheel back out of the room. Somehow, you get the impression that these robots would have been
 happier if you'd left them inactive.] Be on your way now. You are dismissed.}
{321}{}{Tack.}
{322}{}{Dismissed? What am I, a guardsman? Later, old timer.}
{330}{}{Lämna mig ifred!}
{331}{}{I want nothing more to do with you.}
{332}{}{MACH ES DIR SELBER!!}
{333}{}{I'm busy right now.}
{334}{}{Come back later.}
{335}{}{Can't you see I'm in conference?}
{336}{}{We must destroy this place immediately!}
{337}{}{That's absurd!}
{338}{}{Never!}
{339}{}{Only with destruction of the old can the new be reborn.}
{340}{}{All in favor?}
{341}{}{The robots must be reactivated!}
{342}{}{Warmduschers! All of you!}
{343}{}{Our weapon defenses are in dire need of ammunition!}
{344}{}{If I was in charge, things would actually get done around here!}
{345}{}{Halt die Schnauze!}
{400}{}{Arrest me? You're a hologram. You can't even touch me.}
{401}{}{I see I got a goddamn Klugscheißer on my hands! You think I can't beat the piss out of a Warmduscher like you? Well, maybe I can't, but that's what the damn robots are for! Now I'm running out of patience real fast. You best start explaining yourself. How do I know you're not a Chinese spy?}
{410}{}{You the one that brought the robot control computer back online?}
{411}{}{That's right.}
{412}{}{Uh... maybe.}
{413}{}{Nope. Wasn't me.}
{420}{}{Quatsch! You're the only flesh and blood being around, so I damn well know it was you.}
{421}{}{Alright, fine, it was me.}
