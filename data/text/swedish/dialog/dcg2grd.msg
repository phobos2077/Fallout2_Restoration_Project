{100}{}{You see a gangster.}
{150}{}{He seems to be a member of Lara's gang.}
{151}{}{She seems to be a member of Lara's gang.}
{200}{}{Wise guy.}
{201}{}{There you are.}
{202}{}{Pay back.}
{203}{}{Come here.}
{204}{}{I'm not through with you.}
{205}{}{Subba.}
{225}{}{Wonder how long things will last around here with Metzger gone?}
{226}{}{So, Metzger's finally dead?}
{227}{}{Was that your handiwork?}
{228}{}{The Den'll never be the same again.}
{240}{}{I can't believe it, we actually beat them!}
{241}{}{Metzger's got to show us respect now.}
{242}{}{We sure showed them.}
{243}{}{We gave 'em our own brand of justice.}
{244}{}{We couldn't have done it without you!}
{245}{}{Thank you for your help!}
{246}{}{We did it!}
{247}{}{You screwing around with us?}
{248}{}{Better watch your step.}
{249}{}{Lara's the only reason we don't string you up right now.}
{250}{}{What were you trying to pull?}
{251}{}{Ynkrygg.}
{252}{}{You make me sick.}
{253}{}{Get lost.}
{254}{}{Beat it.}
{255}{}{We're ready when you are.}
{256}{}{It's about time we pay them back.}
{257}{}{I hate waiting.}
{258}{}{Let's go already.}
{259}{}{You ready yet?}
{260}{}{Just let Lara know when it's time.}
{270}{}{You looking to join up?}
{271}{}{You must be here to see Lara.}
{272}{}{How's it going?}
{273}{}{Lara's the person you should be talking to.}
{274}{}{Hej.}
{275}{}{You here to see Lara?}
{300}{}{Hej.}
{301}{}{How's it going?}
{302}{}{Hope things are going good.}
{303}{}{So you might be able to help us out?}
{304}{}{Good to see you.}
{305}{}{We'll pay back Tyler soon...}
{306}{}{Any new developments?}
{310}{}{Thanks for the help. Too bad about Lara.}
{311}{}{We finally got em!}
{312}{}{We couldn't have done this without you.}
{313}{}{At least Lara went out in fight.}
{314}{}{I can't believe Lara didn't make it.}
{315}{}{We sure showed Metzger who's best.}
{316}{}{Metzger's better off with us.}
{350}{}{You said it!}
{351}{}{They're dead meat!}
{352}{}{We're going to kick some serious ass!}
{400}{}{We kicked serious ass! We'll be over at the church if you need us.}
{500}{}{Shit, I can't believe we lost Lara. We took care of the skeleton crew here, but Tyler and his crew are still alive.
 If we attack them now during their party over in the Residential area, we're sure to catch them off guard. Let's finish this job. You still in?}
{501}{}{Let me heal first. I'll tell you when I am ready.}
{502}{}{Let's go.}
{510}{}{You ready to take Tyler and his crew out?}
{520}{}{Hey, don't stray too far. We need to finish this tonight.}
