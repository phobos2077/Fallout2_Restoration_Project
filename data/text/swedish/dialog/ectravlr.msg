{100}{}{You see a traveler.}
{101}{}{Hail! Fellow traveler.}
{102}{}{I'm in need of directions. Can you help me out?}
{103}{}{Where are you headed?}
{104}{}{What do you do?}
{105}{}{Ug.}
{106}{}{Well... I don't know. I'm pretty new to this area and I've only been to the following areas.}
{115}{}{No, I've been there already. Thanks anyway.}
{116}{}{New Reno -- now that's a great place to go. Sex, drugs and gambling. What more can one ask for?
 Here, let me show you where it is.}
{117}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{118}{}{Vault City -- now that's a city of morons. Grow an extra finger and they treat you like some kind
 of freak. Never been inside, but I know where it is.}
{119}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{120}{}{Redding... I don't know much about it, other than it's an old mining town. It's located up north,
 right smack dab in the middle of some of meanest mountains you've ever seen.}
{121}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{122}{}{I'd stay away from the Den if I were you. It's a magnet for lowlifes of the area. I'll show you
 where it is, but I don't recommend you go there.}
{123}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{124}{}{San Francisco. Um... all I can say is that the people there are... strange. It's located on the
 coast.}
{125}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{126}{}{The New California Republic... now there's a nice place. I'd like to settle down and live there
 some day. Clean, nice people, and very well maintained. It's located right here on your map.}
{127}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{128}{}{Yeah, a while back I came across an abandoned mining camp. Thought I'd rest there a day or two,
 but then wolves started showing up and I thought it best if I left. A shame, too; it looks like the
 miners left in a hurry. They left a lot of stuff behind. I'm not planning to go back, so I guess it's
 all right if I show you where it is.}
{129}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{130}{}{Yeah, a while back I came across an old facility that looked like it'd been abandoned since the Great War.
 Looked pretty important too, so I bet it's chock full of pre-war goods. I would've scavenged the place myself,
 but it's grounds were covered with some real pissed off man-eating plants. I'm not planning on going back, so I guess
 it's all right if I show you where it is.}
{131}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{132}{}{Oh... it doesn't really matter. I just decided to travel one day and well, here I am.}
{133}{}{Maybe you can help me. I need some directions.}
{134}{}{What do you do?}
{135}{}{Nice talking to you.}
{136}{}{I do odd jobs here and there to get me by. But mostly I just travel.}
{137}{}{Maybe you can help me. I need some directions.}
{138}{}{Where you headed?}
{139}{}{Nice talking to you.}
{140}{}{I really should be going now. It was nice talking to you.}
{141}{}{Maybe we'll meet again.}
{142}{}{I want to make the next town by nightfall. I'd better go.}
{143}{}{I'd better be going.}
{144}{}{Ambush!}
{145}{}{Can't trust anyone these days.}
{146}{}{You have broken the code of the traveler.}
{147}{}{Time to go.}
{148}{}{I've overstayed my welcome.}
{149}{}{I must depart.}
{150}{}{Thanks. I need directions to some other places.}
{1107}{}{New Reno.}
{1108}{}{Vault City.}
{1109}{}{Redding.}
{1110}{}{The Den.}
{1111}{}{San Francisco.}
{1112}{}{New California Republic.}
{1113}{}{An abandoned mine.}
{1114}{}{An old, abandoned facility.}
