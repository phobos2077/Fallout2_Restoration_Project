{101}{}{You see Three-Card Monte.}
{150}{}{You see a spindly-looking old man with a sunburned face. He's so thin he looks like he's made out of twigs.}

{289}{}{No thanks.}
{300}{}{(You hand over the cash. Monte nods, shows you the cards, then lays them on the ground. As he does, he palms a card, so quickly you almost miss it. He then proceeds to shuffle for a few seconds.)}

{302}{}{So... which one's the queen, lady?}

{367}{}{Middlie! Middlie!}
{368}{}{Oh, I don't know... the one on the left.}
{369}{}{Hmmmm... maybe the one on the right?}
{370}{}{Gee, I'm not sure... I think it's the one in the middle.}
{375}{}{(Monte turns over the card. It is the queen of hearts. He seems paralyzed with shock.) Uh...? Heh. Eh...}
{376}{}{guess you win, pal.}
{377}{}{guess you win, lady.}

{382}{}{Well, thanks, Monte. See you later.}
{385}{}{(Monte turns over the card. It is the queen of hearts. He looks shocked.) Uh...? Heh... uh...}
{386}{}{guess you win, pal.}
{387}{}{guess you win, lady.}
{388}{}{That cleans me out, though... (Looks at you weakly) Anything else I could do for you?}
{389}{}{Nuttin. Me just wanted sum extra EXP. Bye. Bye.}
{390}{}{What have you GOT?}
{391}{}{Why don't you give me some information?}
{392}{}{Forget it, Monte. We'll call it even for today.}
{400}{}{(Looks pained.) Eh... well, I do have something... but it's worth WAY more than you won... still...}
{401}{}{Well? What is it?}
{402}{}{If it's worth more to you than dying on Golgotha because you welched on a debt, that's your problem. I'd think
 about it, if I were you.}
{404}{}{Eh... hmnnn... depends on what you want to know.}
{405}{}{You know who dusted Wright's kid? Made him O.D. on Jet?}
{406}{}{You know where I could find some guy named Pretty Boy Lloyd?}
{407}{}{You know where my car is, Monte?}
{408}{}{Got anything you think I should know?}
{409}{}{Nevermind, Monte. We're even. See you later.}
{415}{}{Eh... well... look, you ain't heard it from me, but my bets on Renesco, that asshole who runs the pharmacy on the west side.
 I don't know if he sold it TO the kid for sure, but he knows something. That's all I'm gonna say.}
{416}{}{All right then, Monte. We're even.}
{420}{}{Eh... well... (looks like he's fighting an inner battle) ...look, you ain't heard it from me, but if I was you, I'd
 check out the basement of the Desperado.}
{421}{}{All right then, Monte. We're even.}
{425}{}{(Narrows his eyes, leans in) I'd ask ol' Jules at the front of town. Nothing gets by him... and
 if it DID, then he had a finger in it, know what I'm saying?}
{426}{}{All right then, Monte. We're even.}
{430}{}{Well... know that Eldridge fella that runs New Reno Arms? He says he does weapon upgrades, but I never see him do
 any work. Might be worthwhile to check out his place... but you didn't hear that from me.}
{431}{}{All right then, Monte. We're even.}
{435}{}{(Monte frowns as he sees you.) Look, I ain't running no games today, all right? Blow.}
{436}{}{Can I buy that card you showed me before?}
{437}{}{I wanted some information...}
{438}{}{All right, Monte. I'll leave... for now.}
{440}{}{Nope. Ain't gonna part with that. Period. It's GENUINE pre-war memorabilia... a little slice of history. No WAY.}
{441}{}{You making me ANOTHER offer? Look, I told you I ain't selling it.}
{442}{}{How about a thousand chips? I got it with me. It's yours in exchange for that card.}
{443}{}{Not even for 750 chips?}
{444}{}{How about 500 chips?}
{445}{}{250 chips sound about right?}
{446}{}{Okay. I had some other questions...}
{447}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{450}{}{You deaf? That amount ain't even enough to interest me.}
{451}{}{How about I suggest another amount...?}
{452}{}{I had some other questions...}
{453}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{460}{}{Well, it ain't THAT dear to me. It's yours, pal. (He glances to the right and left, then reaches down and pulls off his
 boot. He twists off the heel and pulls out a playing card from inside.) Here ya go. Take care of it.}
{461}{}{I had some other questions...}
{462}{}{Thanks, Monte. Always a pleasure.}
{465}{}{(Frowns) Whether I talk depends on what you want to know. And it's not gonna be cheap.}
{466}{}{You know who dusted Wright's kid? Made him O.D. on Jet?}
{467}{}{You know where I could find some guy named Pretty Boy Lloyd?}
{468}{}{You know where my car is, Monte?}
{469}{}{Got anything you think I should know?}
{470}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{475}{}{No way in Golgotha am I going to even TOUCH that subject. Piss off.}
{476}{}{Look, that subject's just bad news. Leave it alone, all right?}
{477}{}{You making me another offer? Look, I told you I AIN'T going talk about it.}
{478}{}{A thousand chips change your mind? I got it with me.}
{479}{}{Not even for 750 chips?}
{480}{}{How about 500 chips?}
{481}{}{250 chips sound about right?}
{482}{}{Uh... Golgotha?}
{483}{}{I had some other questions...}
{484}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{490}{}{(Shakes his head.) No way. Talking about that could get somebody killed, startin' with me. Forget it.}
{491}{}{How about if I offered you this...}
{492}{}{I had some other questions...}
{493}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{495}{}{Eh... well... that's a lot of chips. (Licks his lips. He looks like he's fighting an inner battle....but the battle is a brief one.) Look, you ain't heard it from me...}
{496}{}{Understood. Go on.}
{500}{}{(Sneers) Maybe I heard something, maybe I didn't. Name a price.}
{501}{}{All right... talk a price.}
{502}{}{How about a thousand chips? I got it with me.}
{503}{}{Not even for 750 chips?}
{504}{}{How about 500 chips?}
{505}{}{250 chips sound about right?}
{506}{}{I had some other questions...}
{507}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{510}{}{Ha! You couldn't buy a bucket of piss for that much. Forget it.}
{511}{}{How about if I offered you this...}
{512}{}{I had some other questions...}
{513}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{515}{}{Thaaaat's about right. (Grins evilly.) Look, you ain't heard it from me, but if I was you, I'd check out the basement of the Desperado on Virgin Street. There's a lot of "rats" there, if you catch my drift.}
{516}{}{I had some other questions...}
{517}{}{Got it. Thanks.}
{520}{}{(Shrugs) Maybe I know something about that, maybe I don't. Tell me a price and I might have something to say.}
{521}{}{All right... talk a price.}
{522}{}{How about a thousand chips? I got it with me.}
{523}{}{Not even for 750 chips?}
{524}{}{How about 500 chips?}
{525}{}{250 chips sound about right?}
{526}{}{I had some other questions...}
{527}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{530}{}{(Narrows his eyes, leans in) For that amount, I don't know nothing.}
{531}{}{How about if I offered you this...}
{532}{}{I had some other questions...}
{533}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{535}{}{That's about right... (narrows his eyes, leans in) ...I'd ask ol' Jules at the front of town. Nothing
 gets by him... and if it DID, then he had a finger in it, know what I'm saying?}
{536}{}{I had some other questions...}
{537}{}{All right then, Monte. Thanks.}
{540}{}{(Shrugs) I hear things, I see things. For 200 chips, maybe you can get the benefit of my experience, know what I'm saying?}
{541}{}{Here's 200 chips.}
{542}{}{I'll give you 150.}
{543}{}{100 chips or nothing.}
{544}{}{I had some other questions...}
{545}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{550}{}{You deaf? I SAID 200 chips, n' I meant it.}
{551}{}{All right. Here's 200 chips.}
{552}{}{I had some other questions...}
{553}{}{Nevermind then, Monte. I'm outta here.}
{555}{}{Done. (Monte leans in) Well, know that guy Eldridge, runs New Reno Arms? He SAYS he does
 weapon upgrades, but I never see him do any work. You might want to check out his place... but you didn't hear that from me.}
{556}{}{I had some other questions...}
{557}{}{Understood. Thanks, Monte.}

{561}{}{Oh... I see. Now, about the Wright kid...}
{562}{}{Forget the Wright kid. I had some other questions...}

 is a man with a strange hat, wielding a club.) Interested? It's genuine pre-war memorabilia.}
{571}{}{No, I already have enough inventory items... I'd rather have some information instead.}
{572}{}{Uh, sure. Why not? This'll settle things between us.}
{573}{}{Sorry pal, no chips, no game. Come back when you got more money.}
{574}{}{Sorry lady, no chips, no game. Come back when you got more money.}
