{150}{}{You see an elderly man in brown robes with whiskey blotches on his cheeks. He looks a leeeettle unsteady.}
{151}{}{You see Father Tully. He looks like he's tipped back a few wet ones.}
{200}{}{I am thoroughblest.}
{201}{}{And the womanfolk should greet me with a holy kiss.}
{202}{}{I'll drink the devil outta me if I must.}

{205}{}{Damnation, I'm sobering up. I need a drink.}
{206}{}{Why'z the ground sliding all around...}
{207}{}{A bottle a' hootch will help me speak in tongues.}
{208}{}{A fifth of hootch would kill this devil in my head.}
{209}{}{Ooohhh. It's been an hour since I last had a swig...}
{210}{}{Time to drink deep of the holy spirit.}
{211}{}{I drink in the name of all that is holy.}
{220}{}{Want t'know th' church's attitude toward fellatio?}
{221}{}{Sinfulness! Wickedness! Eh... what are you doing later?}

 trying to make his way in this unforgiving world... I'm no hero.}
{231}{}{I tangled with the Enclave, yes. They started it -- I finished it. But don't get me wrong, Father. I'm just a woman,
 trying to make her way in this unforgiving world... I'm no hero.}
{232}{}{I better go, Father. It was nice smell... uh, talking to you.}

{239}{}{Er... no thanks, Father. I really have to be going.}
{240}{}{(Tully goes over to one of the pews, rips off a board from the seat, and pulls out a grimy soft-cover book.) Here ya go.

{257}{}{Who are you?}
{258}{}{Are you drunk?}
{259}{}{'Father' Tully, huh? Can you do divorces?}
{261}{}{Say, I brought some hootch, Father. Can we talk for a moment...?}
{262}{}{Nothing. Sorry to bother you.}
{270}{}{(Sniffs his armpits, then his robes.) My word, I sure smell strongly, don't I? Damnation, I smell like a still!
 Better get clean 'fore Missuz Wright catchez me...}
{271}{}{Bye bye pee pee man}
{275}{}{Hell, musta over-slept... woulda noticed otherwise... what th' hell was I saying?}
{290}{}{Father Tully, at yer service. I'm th' spiritual advisor to the good p... well, to th' people of New Reno.}
{291}{}{Is being drunk the only way that you can accomplish that?}
{292}{}{I had some questions about New Reno...}
{295}{}{I see. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{300}{}{Certintly not! In th' PAST, I was known to indulge in th'spirits, but th' Temperance Union has helped me break th' filthy habit!}
{301}{}{The Temper --?}
{302}{}{Oh. I didn't --}
{303}{}{Break th --?}
{305}{}{Temprance Union, Misssus Wright... same pershun. Tryin' ta clean up New Reeno. Done a pretty good job with me.}
{306}{}{Sure has. I had some other questions...}
{315}{}{Queshions? Can't say I know tooo much 'bout them. But ast away.}
{316}{}{Have you heard of Vault 13?}
{317}{}{I'm here because I'm looking for my tribe. They were kidnapped from my village.}
{318}{}{You don't know how to fix an oil tanker, do you?}
{319}{}{Have you heard about something called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{320}{}{Can you tell me a little bit about New Reno?}
{323}{}{Maybe I'll come back when you're a little drier.}
{325}{}{Well... Reno... itz... well, itz... well... um, say...}
{326}{}{A Garden o' Eden Creashun Kit? Nope. Can't say I've ever heard of one. Say, um...}
{327}{}{Vault thurteen? No idea... well, I mean, therez Vault CITY to th' northeast. That what you lookin' for, maybe? Hmmmm... say, um...}
{328}{}{Slaverz, maybe? Heard thaz where they get a lotta their stock... um... say...}
{329}{}{Tanker? Thing with treads an' a barrel...? Don't know much 'bout that....um... say...}
{330}{}{Yes...?}
{335}{}{Pardon me for asking, do you happenta have a bottle on you? I need sum fer th' services... and, eh, my throatz a little dry.}
{336}{}{Sure. Here ya go.}
{337}{}{Not on me, I'm afraid.}
{338}{}{I could go snag some, if you want.}
{440}{}{Now I'm onna straight and narrow, thankz to Missus Wright... bless her soul. I've been clean fer almost a... uh, month. Or wazzit
 a week? Aw, hell, I don't know. }
{441}{}{A week might be pushing it. Say, I had some questions for you...}
{442}{}{Dry as sand, huh? How many fingers am I holding up?}
{443}{}{Temperance Union?}
{444}{}{Missus Wright?}
{445}{}{Maybe I'll come back when you're sober.}
{450}{}{(Tully stumbles over to the poor box beside the podium, and fishes around inside.) }
{451}{}{Uh... hmmnn. (His hands come up empty.) Afraid I haven't got any chipz afterall.}
{452}{}{Hmnnn. Here ya go...(He dumps some chips into your hand.) Blesst be the poor. Go spend in the name of all that is holee.}
{453}{}{Thanks anyway, Father. I'll see if I can scrounge up some hootch.}
{454}{}{Thanks, Father. I'll be back with the hootch soon.}
{460}{}{Don't give two secondz to 'is whife n' daughter... no wonder both o' em have grown up wiiild.
 Heh-heh... all comez out in th' confessional, y'know...}
{461}{}{Oh, and what does Mr. Bishop say in the confessional?}
{462}{}{Oh, and what does Mrs. Bishop say in the confessional?}
{463}{}{What does Mrs. Bishop say in the confessional? She doesn't talk about me, does she... I mean, cause there's
 nothing to talk about. All lies.}
{464}{}{Oh, and what does Bishop's daughter say in the confessional?}
{465}{}{Uh, what does Bishop's daughter say in the confessional? Nothing about me, I ho... er, nothing bad, I hope.}
{466}{}{I imagine. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{470}{}{Naw, Vault City told him ta STICK it up his poopchute. So... not long after, Vault City starts getting raided. Fast.
 Hard. An' all th' while, right there is Bischop, telling 'em, "I COULD help, IF you join with New Reno."}
{471}{}{Hmmm. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{472}{}{So, blackmail's Bishop's game? A few raids, a few deaths, and Vault City might be ready to be friends with New Reno.
 Not too subtle, but effective. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{473}{}{That seems an odd tactic... I mean, it's much more likely Vault City would try and get help from someone else before
 caving into Bishop's pressure. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{474}{}{That seems an odd tactic... I mean, it's much more likely Vault City would try and get help from someone else... like
 NCR, for example... before caving into Bishop's pressure. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{475}{}{Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{476}{}{Very interesting, Father. Thanks for talking with me.}
{480}{}{(Stares at your hand.) Izzat six? Or izzit three...}
{481}{}{Very good. Both of those are right. Say, I had some questions...}
{482}{}{Can you do divorces?}
{484}{}{Maybe I'll come back when you sober up.}
{490}{}{Devil take me, 'course I can! Reno waz th' divorce capital even 'fore th' Big One. }
{491}{}{This th' filly you wanna break vows with? }
{492}{}{This th' stud you wanna break vows with? }
{493}{}{(Looks confused for a moment as he stares at both of you. Then he shrugs, drinks.)}
{494}{}{You bet. Can we start now?}
{495}{}{Maybe... I'm still thinking about it. I may be back, though.}
{500}{}{Well, I seem to have misplaced my sermon book with all the offishul stuff...}
{501}{}{Screw the book. Here's some hootch. Can you just make something up?}
{502}{}{Here's some hooch. Can you just make something up?}
{503}{}{Screw the book. If I bring you a bottle, think you could just make up something?}
{504}{}{If I bring you a bottle, think you could just make up something?}
{505}{}{Oh, well. Maybe the book'll turn up.}
{510}{}{Well, it wouldn't be right... unless the hootch was reeeally good.}
{511}{}{No fear. I'll be back.}
{512}{}{Well, I can go get some. But I'll need some chips first.}
{520}{}{Sure! Lemme just polish thiz off, git th' fire going...(He downs the bottle with frightening speed.)...all right then, step up to th' podium, you two...}
{521}{}{Step on up...}
{530}{}{Oh. All right then. No harm in asking... so... uh... I'm sorry, who are you again?}
{531}{}{You know, I could go snag some hootch for you, if you want.}
{540}{}{Now there's a fine idea! May you be thrice-blesst! Eh... I happen t'know a PLACE on th' East Side, at the old train
 station, that sells th' kind of holy water I need.}
{541}{}{Okay. I'll go get some. Be right back.}
{542}{}{Okay. I'll go get some. But I'll need some chips to buy it.}
{550}{}{Courze, a courze... chipz, chipz... where do I keep the chipz...(His eyes turn to the poor box beside the podium.) Ah! Don't
 know why I didn't think of this before... Houl onna minute...}
{551}{}{Patiently wait for him to make the withdrawal from the poor box.}
{552}{}{Uh, nevermind, Father. This one's on me.}
{560}{}{(Father Tully glances at the... now... empty bottle in his hands.) Say, don't mean to impose, friend: would yoo happenta
 have 'nother bottle of that fine vintage on you? All thiz talkin' is making me parsched.}
{570}{}{Thank you kindly! (Takes bottle, takes a swig.) Ahhh... sorry... what in the hells was I talking about?}
{571}{}{Eh... well, now, most certintly! (Takes bottle.) Don't usually touch the stuff, y'know...(Takes a deep drink.)...ahhhh... um, sorry, what waz I saying?}
{572}{}{Eh... damn kind of you! (Takes bottle.) Don't usually drink this much, y'know...(Takes a long swig.) Ahhhh... I'm sorry, what was I saying?}
{573}{}{You were talking about family Bishop.}
{574}{}{You were talking about family Wright.}
{575}{}{You were talking about family Mordino.}
{576}{}{You were talking about family Salvatore.}
{578}{}{You were talking about Richard Wright's death.}
{579}{}{I'll come back when you're sober.}
{590}{}{Eh? The Bishops, right... power-hungry's the lotta 'em, itz in th' blood. Thing is, ol' John Bischop iz so concerned
 'bout taking over everthin' he ain't taking care of business at hoome...}
{591}{}{Business at home?}
{600}{}{Well, not much, but I hear thingz OUSSIDE th' confessional about oul' Bishop. Crafty devil. Got iron ballz, he
 does... must clink when he walkz. I figger he'z behind thosse raidz on Vault City... you heard 'bout those?}
{601}{}{Nej.}
{602}{}{Ja.}
{603}{}{Father, keep it down. That kind of talk could get you killed in this town...}
{604}{}{Look, maybe I'll come back when you're sober.}
{610}{}{(Ignores you.) See, a few months back, oul' Bishop sends a caravan to Vault City, SUGGESTING a marriage o' convenience 'tween
 Vault City n' New Reno.}
{611}{}{Did they reach an agreement?}
{612}{}{I trust they didn't reach an agreement?}
{620}{}{Mostly what you'd 'xpect from a neglected wifey-o with a body whoose curves could cure th' blind. Mostly adultery.
 I mean, have you SEEN her rack? My word!}
{621}{}{Uh... what else can you tell me about the Bishops, Father?}
{622}{}{Yeah, she does have a nice rack. I mean... so I've heard. Uh, what else can you tell me about the Bishops, Father?}
{623}{}{Er... she didn't say WHO she was adulterous with, did she, Father?}
{625}{}{Agreed. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{630}{}{Oooh, sweeeet little Angela? Little HELLION more like it! Girl's got too mucha deevil in her britches. Always
 floozying around, banging her father's help n' pumping herself fulla Jet...}
{631}{}{Uh, banging her father's help? Did she say who?}
{632}{}{Jet?}
{633}{}{This sounds like a great family. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{634}{}{I had some other questions, Father...}
{635}{}{I guess children will be children. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{640}{}{Who? A-course she did, but th' list a-who she DIDN'T fool around with would be easier to name off. She tells everyone,
 bragssz 'bout it. Say... what waz yer name again?}
{641}{}{Uh, nothing... what else can you tell me about the Bishops, Father?}
{642}{}{Me? Celibate monks such as myself don't have names. Say, I did have some other questions, Father...}
{643}{}{Me? Celibate nuns such as myself don't have names. Say, I did have some other questions, Father...}
{644}{}{Talk to you later, Father.}
{650}{}{Devil's blood! Wickedness! Foul secretion from th' very teat of evil!}
{651}{}{So... you don't like Jet then?}
{652}{}{Uh, yes. Teat of evil. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{653}{}{All right then. Talk to you later, Father.}
{660}{}{That drug'll be th' death of us. Can't think of another drug...(Drinks, belches.)...that doess more damage than Jet... Killz
 th' mind and th' body. Damn Mordinos...}
{661}{}{What was that about the Mordinos?}
{663}{}{Uh, I'd nurse that bottle a little longer next time, Father. Talk to you later.}
{670}{}{Heh-heh! Wright, eh? (Smiles, wiggles eyebrows.) Lemme tell you a lit-tle sumthin' about th' WRIGHTS... they're a split
 bunch of horny drunks and stonefast puritans, they are!}
{671}{}{Oh, really?}
{672}{}{I think I've heard enough, Father. Thanks for talking with me.}
{680}{}{Those Wrights just keep squeezing out kids... oul' Orville Wright must wanna re-pop-ulate th' world. Hope Missus Wright
 can take th' strain. Heh-heh. An' the thingz they SAY in th' confessional...}
{681}{}{Oh, really? What does Missus Wright say in the confessional?}
{682}{}{Oh, really? What does ol' ORVILLE Wright say in the confessional?}
{683}{}{What does the Wright Family control in New Reno?}
{684}{}{Oh, I bet it's really juicy stuff. Maybe we can talk about it some other time.}
{690}{}{ETHYL Wright? That blesst woman! Keeps me off th' drink, an' on th' straight n' narrow. (Takes a swig.) She can drive th' sin
 outta you, she can... uh, but... what in hell waz I saying?}
{691}{}{About Missus Wright in the confessional...}
{692}{}{You were talking about the Wright Family...}
{693}{}{Nevermind. I had some other questions...}
{694}{}{Nothing much more, I think. Thanks for talking with me.}
{700}{}{Oh, right, right. Well, uh, in th' confessional, she ain't got much t'say. Mostly guilt 'bout stepping on bugs... or 'bout
 enjoying sex with her hubbie too much. Heh-heh. (Takes a swig.) I looove guilt.}
{701}{}{I had some other questions about the Wrights...}
{702}{}{I see. I had some other questions...}
{703}{}{It shows. Thanks for talking with me.}
{710}{}{Oul' Orville? Well, he's got a lotta guilt on his shoulders. See, he promised th' Missus he'd quit the alcohol biz, but
 he has a secret still in th' train station behind th' house! She'll beat him uglier than he is if she finds it...}
{711}{}{Heh-heh, herez the funny bit... y'see, ol Mr. Wright promised the Missus he'd quit the alcohol biz, but he has a secret
 still in the train station behind the house! Ha! She'll beat him uglier than he is if she finds it...}
{712}{}{Tell me about Mrs. Wright...}
{713}{}{Tell me more about the Wrights...}
{715}{}{A secret still in the train station behind the house, huh? Very interesting, Father. Thanks for the info.}
{720}{}{Nuthin'! (Takes a drink.) They're the weakest of th' families, cuz they only brew alke-hol. Barely turn a cent, they do.
 Th' other families buy alke-hol offa them mostly outta pity.}
{721}{}{Where does this alcohol come from?}
{722}{}{Interesting. Tell me more about the Wrights...}
{724}{}{Very interesting, Father. Thanks for the info.}
{730}{}{Th'Mordinos? (Holds up three fingers.) Therez two o' them. (Holds hand up high.) Big Jeezus... (Holds hand down low.) ...an' Leetle
 Jeezus. The Father n' the Son. They control th' drugs and the whoa-men in Reno.}
{731}{}{Tell me about Big Jesus.}
{732}{}{Tell me about Little Jesus.}
{733}{}{So they are the source of drugs and control most of the whores in New Reno?}
{740}{}{Jesus? He's one bad muthuh...(Takes a swig, swishes it around in cheeks.) Deals in slavez, Jet, n' whores. Only person
 worse'n him is hiz filthy son.}
{741}{}{His son?}
{742}{}{So Jesus Mordino Senior controls most of the drugs and whores in New Reno?}
{743}{}{Great family. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{744}{}{Like father, like son. Well, thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{750}{}{Leetle Jezus? Bastard! He's like a prairie tick, sucking blood from hiz Dad's work. Be trouble for alla Reno if he took
 charge. Couldn't hold it toogether, drugz, whorez... all fall down.}
{752}{}{The Mordinos are the source of drugs and most of the whores in New Reno?}
{754}{}{Just like you in a few seconds. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{760}{}{(Tully stares at you.) }
{761}{}{Yesss... (Smiles, licks lips.) ...whoresss... (Begins stroking neck of the bottle.)}
{762}{}{Uh, Father? About the drugs?}
{763}{}{I think I better go. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{770}{}{Eh? Drugz... yes, the drugs. Jet. Filthy Jet. Do horrible thingz with it, horrible... Redding... the Stables. (Takes a swig.) All fer gold...}
{772}{}{What about Redding?}
{773}{}{What about the Stables?}
{775}{}{Interesting. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{780}{}{(Makes a walking motion with his two fingers.) Jet leavez town, goez ta Redding. Gold leavez Redding, goez to Mordino.
 (Takes a swig.) Miners die, Mordinos lie.}
{782}{}{What were you saying about the Stables?}
{784}{}{So the Mordinos are selling Jet to Redding, huh? Interesting. Thanks, Father.}
{790}{}{Mordinos havva... farm... ousside of town. Keep slaves there. Test... Jet... on them. Killz them in drovez. (Shudders.) Only th' Mordinos
 know where th' Stables are.}
{792}{}{What were you saying about Redding?}
{794}{}{The Mordinos are testing Jet on slaves, huh? Interesting. Thanks, Father.}
{800}{}{I wuz talking 'bout the Salvatores? (Blinks, shrugs, then drinks.) Can't imagine what I was saying. Family's as silent as
 death. An' you don't wanna cross 'em, either... know why?}
{803}{}{Don't really need to know why right now, Father. Can I ask you some other questions?}
{804}{}{Look, maybe I'll come back when you're sober.}
{810}{}{(Lumbers on drunkenly.) Cuz they got weapons like fires from heaven, weapons no one's ever SEEN before in New Reno or
 nowhere. Shoot beams of light, cut a man in two, leave him twitching in the dust.}
{811}{}{Shoot beams of light?}
{812}{}{Shoot beams of light? You mean laser weapons?}
{814}{}{Wow... maybe I should try and get a hold of one. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{820}{}{Thaz what I heard them call them... lay-sers... but ta me, those weapons are the devil's own, foul lightbringers, tools
 meant for nuthin but death!}
{821}{}{Yes, of course, Father. Tools of the devil and all that. What do the other families think of these 'lightbringers?'}
{823}{}{Tools of the devil, huh? Maybe I should try and get a hold of one. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{830}{}{One of them lightbringers can kill a dozen men... Other families useta fight with th' Salvatores, but now no one messes
 with 'em. Itz a peace of sorts... good as long azzit holds out, I s'pose.}
{831}{}{Who's in charge of the Salvatores, Father?}
{833}{}{I suppose. Well, thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{840}{}{Louie... LOUIS... Salvatore runz th' show. (Drains bottle, coughs slightly.) Cripple. Needz an oxygen tank ta keep breathin'... his
 lungs are messed up. Stays in th' top floor of his establishment, never comes out.}
{841}{}{Interesting. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{842}{}{Hmmmm. Tank of oxygen, huh? Interesting. Well, thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{850}{}{That poor boy... Jet took him from his family, it did. That damnable stuff! Worst mind poison ever made...}
{852}{}{Do you know where Richard got the Jet that killed him?}
{853}{}{I had some other questions...}
{854}{}{I see. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{860}{}{He coulda gotten it from anyone in New Reno! There's a pharmacy jest cross th' street run by a drug dealer, and if
 he's not selling, stop an' ask anyone on th' street! Damn Jet!}
{862}{}{The pharmacy across the street? I'll check it out. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{957}{}{Awright, lissen up...}
{958}{}{::Takes a drink::}
{959}{}{::Keeps drinking, drains bottle::}
{960}{}{...by the power divested in me, I divorce ye.}
{961}{}{You may now kick the bride. Groom. Watever.}

{1002}{}{Oh God, *ELCHHHH*}
{1003}{}{Oh Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I'm never drinking that much again.}
{1004}{}{I better get up early and go to confession.}
{1005}{}{Maybe I'll just lay down for a little while.}
{2000}{}{I gotta say, Father, New Reno isn't exactly the first place I'd expect to find a preaching man.}
{2001}{}{Whatza better place than here? B'sidez, they sure as hell didn't want to keep me at their damned Abbey.
 Bah! Lettem keep their peazful, dull, monastery. Who needs it? Huh? Not me! But ya know what? Those monks sure could
 make sum good hooch. Oh boy, best damn hooch ever. (He licks his lips.) Ol' Samuel and I, we had ourselfz a lotta fun
 wit that hooch, lemme tell ya.}
{2002}{}{Booze at a monastery. Interesting, I think I might have to visit this place. Do you think you could point out its location on my map?}
{2003}{}{Alright, if I'm interpreting your drunken ramblings correctly, then it sounds like you came from some sort of monastery, where you did a
 lot of drinking with some guy named Samuel. Father, if you could point out its location on my map, then maybe I could go meet your friend and try
 some of this hooch you're so fond of.}
{2004}{}{(You pull out your Pip-Boy and hold it out for Father Tully to point out the location. He first points at the ocean, then at a random
 mountain range to the south. After almost poking his eye out, he finally settles his finger on the northeast corner of the map.) Yep, there'z
 the Abbey. That seemz bout right.}
{2005}{}{I appreciate it, Father. I have some other questions though.}
{2006}{}{Thanks. But I'm curious, why'd you leave the Abbey?}
{2007}{}{Thanks, Father. I must be going now.}
{2008}{}{Well dat wuz a loooong time ago. I haddent quite gotten my act together yet. It waz before th' angel Mrs Wright put me in line. Ya see,
 them monks didn't take kindly to my wild ways. Me and Brother Samuel, we useta get a lil crazy. Hehe, this one night, Sammy and I went 'round to
 the sleepin monks, and put their handz in bowls a warm water. Even got the Abbot! Ha! Those were the dayz, lemme tell ya.}
{2009}{}{That's pretty childish, Father. I take it you were eventually kicked out?}
{2010}{}{Right. I've had enough of these amateur drunk stories. See you around, Father.}
{2011}{}{I dunno if I'd say they *kicked* me out... but they zure as hell didn't want me to stick around--not after that night I passed out and
 axidently set fire to one a th' lieberrys. Boy, you shoulda seen the Abbot's face... if he had half a backbone, he'd a prolly strangled me. Ha! So I
 left, and good riddenze! I sure do miss that hooch though. And Samuel, it'd be nice ta know how that ol' dog's doing.}
{2012}{}{I'll be doing a lot of traveling, so if I find my way over to the Abbey, maybe I'll look up this Samuel friend of yours. Hell, maybe
 I'll even bring you back some of that booze.}
{2013}{}{Oh, couldja, please? That'd make me happier than a disease-free Reno whore. Thanks fren.}
{2014}{}{No problem. I have some other questions though.}
{2015}{}{Sure. See you around.}
{2016}{}{I'll be doing a lot of traveling, so if I find my way over to the Abbey, maybe I'll bring you back some of that booze.}
{2017}{}{Interesting. See you around.}
{2020}{}{The Abbey, huh? I've been there before. In fact, I ran into a fellow named Samuel that acts very much like you.}
{2021}{}{Samuel!? Ha! Howzzat fella doin? Been years since I've seen 'im. Still drinking away, is he?}
{2022}{}{Yeah, he reeks of alcohol, much like you.}
{2023}{}{Ah, thaz great. Good to hear he's doin alright. If you see him again, tell him I say hello. So... (He clasps his
 hands together and rubs them eagerly.) So, mebbe you pick up summa the Abbey's famous hooch while yer there?}
{2024}{}{Yeah, I got some right here.}
{2025}{}{I did, but I drank it. Wow is it powerful stuff.}
{2026}{}{No, I haven't.}
{2027}{}{No need ta rub it in my face. Itz been so long since I've had some... I could really go for a bottle or two. Any chance you'll stop by the Abbey again?}
{2028}{}{Thatz too bad. Itz been so long since I've had some. I could really go for a bottle or two. Any chance you
 will be stopping by the Abbey again?}
{2029}{}{You do? Itz been so long since I've had some. Would you be willing to part with it?}
{2030}{}{We'll see. If I do, I'll try to remember to pick some up for you. See you around, Father.}
{2031}{}{Probably not. Look, I must be going.}
{2032}{}{Probably. I pick one up for you when I am passing through. I had some other question though.}
{2033}{}{Sure. Here you go.}
{2034}{}{Actually, I think I'll hold on to this for awhile. Gotta run. Bye.}
{2035}{}{Sure. For a price though.}
{2036}{}{(Father Tully grabs the bottle from your hand and takes a big swig.) Oh yeah, jus like I remember it. (He takes
 several more swigs, waves weakly at you, then stumbles away to the back room. You hear groaning, followed by a thud.)}
{2037}{}{(Father Tully opens the donations box, grabs a handful of coins and hands them to you. You nod and hand him the
 bottle. He snatches it from your hand and takes a big swig.) Oh yeah, jus like I remember it. (He takes several more swigs,
 waves weakly at you and stumbles away to the back room. You hear groaning, followed by a thud.)}
{2040}{}{The Abbey, huh? I've been there before, but I don't recall meeting anyone named Samuel.}
{2041}{}{He's a great fella. If ya ever do run inna him, let him know I'm living the good life in New Reno. I haven't talked with him since I left th' Abbey.}
{2042}{}{Sure. But I'm curious, why'd you leave the Abbey?}
{2045}{}{Really? Thaz too bad. He was a good fella. I'll miss him.}
{2046}{}{Yeah. Well, I have some other questions.}
{2047}{}{Never was much of a mourner. See you around.}
{2050}{}{I'm curious, why'd you leave the Abbey?}
{2060}{}{I spoke with Brother Samuel. He's apparently still drinking himself away.}
{2061}{}{I got a bottle of the Abbey's famous booze.}
{2062}{}{Hehe, good ol' Sam. Thaz good to hear. I s'pose someday I should try an get out there again.}
{2063}{}{Well, see you around, Father.}
{2064}{}{I also got a bottle of the Abbey's famous booze that you wanted.}
{2065}{}{Hehe, good ol' Sam. Thaz good to hear. I s'pose someday I should try an get out there again.}
{3000}{}{You inform both Father Tully and Brother Samuel about the whereabouts of each other.}
{3001}{}{You deliver a bottle of the Abbey's famous brew to Father Tully.}
{3022}{}{Actually, he's dead.}
{20091}{}{Hah! That's classic. I pulled the same prank on my nephew Feargus once, and when he woke up and realized he'd pissed himself, he started bawling -- it was great. Anyway, so did they end up kicking you out?}
