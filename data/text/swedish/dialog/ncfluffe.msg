{100}{}{You see a fluffer.}
{150}{}{You see a moderately attractive woman. She seems to be checking you out.}
{151}{}{You see a fluffer. She seems to be wondering whether she should attend to you or not.}
{160}{}{You see a moderately attractive woman. She's looking at you as if you're a rival.}
{161}{}{You see a fluffer. She's looking at you as if you're a rival.}
{200}{}{Oh my... it's him. }
{201}{}{You are the biggest stud in the world.}
{202}{}{::Swoons::}
{203}{}{I hear the Brothers are looking for you. They want to do a film based on your adventure.}
{204}{}{Yeah, }
{205}{}{::Claps::}
{206}{}{::Cheers::}
{207}{}{Oh my... it's her. }
{208}{}{You go, girl!}
{209}{}{::Gives you the thumbs up sign::}
{225}{}{No WAY am I fluffing that thing.}
{226}{}{How the hell do you go to the bathroom with that thing on?}
{227}{}{Is that some new kind of vibrator?}
{228}{}{Is that some new body condom?}
{235}{}{Need anything, }
{236}{}{Over here, }
{237}{}{Look! It's him!}
{238}{}{It's }
{239}{}{I wish I could do a scene with }
{240}{}{That boy really brings on the cream.}
{241}{}{He can give me a purple mushroom anytime.}
{242}{}{Nasty little crotch cobra you've got there.}
{245}{}{Need anything, }
{246}{}{If I have to take care of one more actor today, I'm going to throw up.}
{247}{}{It's not easy being a fluffer.}
{248}{}{I hear the Families are getting tense again.}
{249}{}{I kicked Jules in his family jewels last week.}
{250}{}{I wish the Brothers would let me act.}
{251}{}{I don't know what the Corsican Brothers SEE in her...}
{255}{}{Oh my... it's him. }
{256}{}{Look at those muscles! Makes me weak...}
{257}{}{He's built like a tank. Check out that barrel.}
{258}{}{Check out the barrel on that tank...}
{259}{}{He's all mine...}
{260}{}{::Sigh::}
{261}{}{That boy really brings on the cream.}
{262}{}{Nasty little crotch cobra you've got there.}
{270}{}{Oh my... it's her. }
{271}{}{Welcome to the studio, ma'am.}
{272}{}{She looks so...(shivers)...dangerous.}
{273}{}{She's pretty sexy.}
{274}{}{Hello, ma'am. Let me know if I can help you with anything.}
{280}{}{Oh my... it's him. }
{281}{}{Welcome to the studio, sir.}
{282}{}{He looks so...(shivers)...dangerous.}
{283}{}{That's one badass if I ever saw one.}
{284}{}{That boy really brings on the cream.}
{285}{}{Nasty little crotch cobra he's got there.}
{290}{}{Oh my... it's her. }
{291}{}{Welcome to the studio, ma'am.}

{300}{}{Oh, shit! It's Myron! Run!}
{301}{}{Crap! It's Myron. Stay calm... he can smell fear.}
{302}{}{You better keep Myron away from me.}
{303}{}{Myron, you better stay the HELL away from me.}
{304}{}{If Myron starts working here, I'm gone.}
{305}{}{Myron, have you passed the five second mark yet?}
{306}{}{Myron, you better get out of here before the Brothers see you.}
{315}{}{Don't these leather freaks know that they're supposed to be here on Wednesdays?}
{316}{}{Great. Another S&M act.}
{317}{}{Oooooh. Black leather. Now THAT'S new.}
{318}{}{We ain't doing any leather or bondage until next week.}
{319}{}{Great, another leather bunny.}
{320}{}{Look, leather bunny, casting is on Wednesday, all right?}
{325}{}{If I have to take care of one more actor today, I'm going to throw up.}
{326}{}{It's not easy being a fluffer.}
{327}{}{I hear the Families are getting tense again.}
{328}{}{I kicked Jules in his family jewels last week.}
{329}{}{The guy with the bone in his nose is kind of cute. In a sadomasochistic sort of way.}
{330}{}{Who's the guy with the bone in his nose?}
{331}{}{Check out the tribal with the bone in his nose. He'll go far.}
{332}{}{Whoa, I've seen accidents on the set, but never a guy who got a bone caught in his nose.}
{333}{}{I wish the Brothers would let me act.}
{334}{}{::Glares at you::}
{335}{}{Great. ANOTHER fluffer. She'll probably work for half price from the look of her.}
{336}{}{Who's she?}
{337}{}{Who are you?}
{345}{}{If I have to take care of one more actor today, I'm going to throw up.}
{346}{}{It's not easy being a fluffer.}

{351}{}{::Glares at you::}
{352}{}{Who's she?}
{353}{}{Who are you?}
{360}{}{The Enclave? President? Tell me the whole story.}
{361}{}{Tom French scripted me. He has soft, gentle hands.}
{362}{}{They were still fighting the WAR?! Really! Good thing you wasted those bastards.}
{363}{}{You are a total badass. I mean, you start from a simple spear-chucking tribal - no offense - and go on to
 save the whole world. You kick ass. End of story.}
{364}{}{You should replay the game as a different kind of character.}
{365}{}{Tell me everything about your fight with the Enclave... I'll get you a cold beer.}
{366}{}{I hear the Brothers are looking for you. They want to do a film based on your adventure.}
{370}{}{Ooops. I dropped something in your pants. Let me get it.}
{371}{}{Um, you wouldn't like to go out for drinks, would you? How about just meaningless sex?}
{372}{}{How do you keep so fit?}
{373}{}{Can I have your autograph? On my chest?}
{374}{}{You being helped, }
{375}{}{I'll need some help with that barrel of yours.}
{376}{}{I hear you're very... hard to work with.}
{377}{}{I heard you cop an attitude, then you cop a feel. Fine by me.}
{378}{}{I'm really happy to know you! I mean, wow, you're }
{379}{}{Um, I know there's no filming going on, but do you need a fluffer anyway?}
{380}{}{Need someone to take care of that for you?}
{381}{}{Need a moist towelette, }
{382}{}{I loved you in Great Balls for Hire.}
{383}{}{I loved you in Good Will Humping.}
{384}{}{You were great in Pokeahotass.}
{385}{}{You were great in Vault Sexteen. Inspired, even.}
{386}{}{I haven't seen the Brothers around... try the office, maybe?}
{387}{}{Any chance you could talk the Corsican Brothers into letting me act?}
{388}{}{Fluffers have the important job of keeping the actors hard.}
{389}{}{Could I act in your next movie?}
{390}{}{I don't want to be a fluffer all my life. No, really.}
{391}{}{I'm just doing this to pay for school.}
{392}{}{My boyfriend doesn't know I work here.}
{393}{}{Hum job? I'll tell you about them some other time.}
{394}{}{My boyfriend doesn't know I work here.}
{395}{}{I wish some of the actors would shower. I mean a regular shower.}
{396}{}{I really want to act.}
{397}{}{My girlfriend doesn't know I work here.}
{398}{}{Can I have your autograph?}
{399}{}{Um, you wouldn't like to go out for drinks, would you? If you're into women, that is.}
{400}{}{::Ignores you::}
{420}{}{Want to jump in the ring with me, champ?}
{421}{}{Nice unit you got there.}
{422}{}{Need someone to take care of that for you, champ?}
{423}{}{Getting out of boxing and into porn? Same thing, different stage.}
{424}{}{Are you getting into the business, too? Welcome aboard, champ.}
{425}{}{Getting into the business? Well, at least you won't have to start where I am.}
{426}{}{Me? I'm a fluffer. Sometimes.}
{427}{}{Fluffers have the important job of keeping the actors hard.}
{428}{}{The Brothers say I'm in-valuable. That's why they sleep with me so much.}
{429}{}{You should go into porn. You got the body for it.}
{430}{}{Wanna box?}
{431}{}{Hum job? I'll tell you about them some other time.}
{432}{}{Watch out for the Masticator. He's a real jerk. He tried to bite my ear off once.}
{433}{}{Hello, ma'am. Can I help you with...*anything?*}
{434}{}{Um, if you're looking for a little company later, ma'am...}

{465}{}{Sorry, no thanks. I could have better sex with my lipstick.}
{466}{}{You? Sorry, I'll NEVER be that desperate.}
{467}{}{Uh, is your friend with the bone in his nose over-compensating for something?}
{468}{}{Is your friend with the bone in his nose seeing anyone?}
{469}{}{Your friend with the bone in his nose is kind of cute. In a sadomasochistic sort of way.}
{470}{}{Who's your cute friend with the bone in his nose?}
{471}{}{Tell the tribal with the bone in his nose that he'll go far in this industry.}
{472}{}{Whoa, I've seen accidents on the set, but never a guy who got a bone caught in his nose.}

{483}{}{I need to lie down.}
{484}{}{Hum job? I'll tell you about them some other time.}
{485}{}{You don't have a problem with skin flicks, do you?}
{486}{}{You the new fluffer?}
{487}{}{Got a towel? One of the actors had an... accident.}
{488}{}{Just don't bite the actors, and you should do fine.}
{489}{}{I wish some of the actors would shower. I mean a regular shower.}
{490}{}{Um, are you new here?}
