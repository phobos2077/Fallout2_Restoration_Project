{150}{}{You see a fat man with beady black eyes. He is covered in sweat and breathing heavily.}
{151}{}{You see Big Jesus Mordino. He is covered in sweat and is breathing heavily.}
{200}{}{Stay away from there.}
{201}{}{That does not... belong to you.}
{202}{}{Touch that again, and you shall... die on Golgotha.}
{210}{}{::Wheeze::}
{211}{}{*Cough* *Cough*}

{220}{}{You are the... *cough*... most valued of my men.}
{221}{}{Are the people of Reno showing you... *cough*... proper respect?}
{230}{}{Urgggg...}
{231}{}{...Dios mio...}
{232}{}{...my heart...}
{233}{}{hurrkkkk}
{240}{}{(The man turns to face you. He looks sick with fever: Sweat trickles down his face and stains his clothes. }
{241}{}{He's ignoring you and staring at Myron; it looks like he's waiting for Myron to speak.)}
{242}{}{He's staring at you; it looks like he's waiting for you to speak.)}
{243}{}{[Stare back at him with your meanest stare.]}
{244}{}{[Stare back at him with mild disinterest.]}
{245}{}{[Stare back at him with a sneering gaze.]}
{246}{}{[Stare back at him with affected disinterest.]}
{247}{}{[Wander off.]}
{248}{}{Who are you?}
{249}{}{Are you Jesus Mordino?}
{250}{}{Sorry. I've entered the wrong room.}
{260}{}{You. (Mordino glares at Myron as he enters, black lightning flashing in his eyes.) You have... left your post. Your USE
 to me is at an... end. (He makes a motion, and his guards reach for their weapons.)}
{261}{}{(The man's gaze darkens. He makes a motion, and his guards reach for their weapons.)}
{262}{}{(Big Jesus's gaze turns black. He makes a motion, and his guards reach for their weapons.)}
{263}{}{Aieeeeeeee!}
{264}{}{Play along!}
{265}{}{Run!}
{266}{}{Whoa! Whoa...!}
{267}{}{Hey! Hold on a second...!}
{268}{}{You want some of THIS, *Fatman?!* You WANT SOME of }
{275}{}{(The man speaks in a rasping voice.) I... am Jesus Mordino. You... will address me as SENOR Mordino. (A bead of sweat trickles
 down his forehead.) What... is your business with me?}
{276}{}{You have... returned. (A bead of sweat trickles down his forehead.) What... is your business with me?}
{277}{}{I'm looking for work.}
{278}{}{I spoke to your son, Senor Mordino. I'm looking for work.}
{279}{}{I spoke to your son, Senor Mordino. I'm a slaver, and I'm looking to sell slaves.}
{280}{}{You know anything about Mr. Wright's son's death?}
{281}{}{Is the heat bothering you? You seem... uncomfortable.}
{282}{}{No business today. I have to go now.}
{290}{}{(Studies you for a long time, then shakes his head.) You... do not look STRONG enough. I have no work for you.}
{291}{}{(Studies you for a long time, then shakes his head.) You... are a WOMAN. What I need done is not woman's work.}
{292}{}{Give me a chance. Give me a job -- any job -- I can do it.}
{293}{}{Give me a chance, Senor Mordino. Give me a job, any job, I can do it.}
{294}{}{Let me prove myself. I can do it.}
{295}{}{Let me prove myself, Senor Mordino. I can do it.}
{296}{}{All right then. Catch you later.}
{305}{}{(Sweat trickles down Mordino's face. His expression darkens.) I have... spoken. I have NO work for you. Leave... and do NOT return.}
{306}{}{C'mon, Big Jesus... just one chance...}
{307}{}{All right then. Goodbye.}
{315}{}{(Mordino is silent for a moment, then he speaks.) I am Jesus Mordino. Head of the Mordino family. You have come
 to... my casino. My home. You have shown me... no respect. You will LEARN.}
{316}{}{I think it's YOU who's going to learn a thing or two...}
{317}{}{Whoa! Hold on... let's talk about this! C'mon, now...}
{318}{}{Make a run for the door.}
{319}{}{::Dive for cover, draw weapons in slow motion as thugs explode from the woodwork.::}
{325}{}{(Mordino waits. As you watch, another bead of sweat trickles down the side of his face.)}
{326}{}{I was looking to sell some slaves...}
{327}{}{What do you know about Richard Wright's death?}
{329}{}{Nevermind.}
{335}{}{(Studies you.) I... do not know you, but I will... hear you. (Wipes sweat from his forehead.) }
{336}{}{You have slaves to sell?}
{337}{}{Yes, right here with me. Take a look and make me an offer.}
{338}{}{No, I don't. Actually, I made an error. I'm looking for work, not to sell slaves.}
{339}{}{No... actually, I had some questions for you.}
{340}{}{No, I'm sorry. I just remembered I have to be somewhere else.}
{345}{}{(Mordino studies your companions. His gaze stops on Miria, and he licks his lips.) Your puta looks fresh... I will
 give you 250 chips for her.}
{346}{}{(Mordino studies your companions. His gaze stops on Davin.) Though he looks weak, I will take that boy there.
 200 chips for him.}
{347}{}{(Mordino studies your companions. His gaze stops on Sulik... and he wrinkles his nose.) The tribal... he stinks, but he
 looks strong. I will take him for 100 chips.}
{348}{}{(Mordino studies your companions. His gaze stops on Vic.) I will take the old man... he looks like he has a few years
 of work left in him. I will take him for 100 chips.}
{349}{}{(Mordino studies your companions. His gaze stops on Cassidy.) I will take the old man... he looks like he has a
 few years of work left in him. I will take him for 100 chips.}
{350}{}{(Mordino's gaze immediately stops on the Robobrain.) That machine there. I will give you 500 chips for him.}
{351}{}{(Mordino's gaze immediately stops on the cyberdog.) I will buy that... machine dog from you. I will give you 500
 chips for him.}
{352}{}{(Mordino studies your companions, then shakes his head.) You have nothing I want.}
{353}{}{Senor Mordino, please... the slave is worth MUCH more than that. It has many years of faithful service remaining.}
{354}{}{That is a fair price. You may have the slave.}
{355}{}{Actually, I'm not looking to sell that one just yet. I did have some questions I wanted to ask you...}
{356}{}{Actually, I'm not looking to sell that slave. Let's deal another time.}
{357}{}{Very well. I had some questions for you, though...}
{358}{}{All right. Some other time when I get better stock, then.}
{370}{}{No. She has seen much hard travel and looks tired... 250 chips for her or nothing.}
{371}{}{The boy looks soft and weak. I'll not give more than 200 chips for him.}
{372}{}{No. The tribal smells and looks to be... difficult. It will be hard to break him in. 100 chips.}
{373}{}{The man is old. I will take him for 100 chips.}
{375}{}{No. 500 chips.}
{377}{}{Senor Mordino, please... you are in danger of insulting me. This is prime stock, it is worth much more than that.}
{390}{}{(Mordino walks around Miria, examines her face carefully, then slaps her ass.) Hmmmm. 500 chips for her, then.}
{391}{}{(Mordino walks around Davin, rolls up the boy's sleeve and examines his muscles, then checks his eyes for drug use.)
 Hmmmm. He looks strong enough. 400 chips for him, then.}
{392}{}{(Mordino walks around Sulik, frowning.) Hmmmm. He looks strong... and tolerant of pain, to stick a bone in his
 nose so far. 200 chips for him.}
{393}{}{(Mordino walks around Vic, frowning.) Hmmmmm. I will take him for 200 chips. No more.}
{394}{}{(Mordino walks around Cassidy, frowning.) Hmmmmm. I will take him for 200 chips. No more.}
{395}{}{(Mordino studies the Robobrain for a few minutes.) A thousand chips, then.}
{396}{}{(Mordino studies the cyberdog for a few minutes.) A thousand chips, then.}
{410}{}{(Mordino has Miria led away while counting your money.) Here.}
{411}{}{(Mordino has Davin led away while counting your money.) Here.}
{412}{}{(Mordino has Sulik led away while counting your money.) Here.}
{413}{}{(Mordino has Vic led away while counting your money.) Here.}
{414}{}{(Mordino has Cassidy led away while counting your money.) Here.}
{415}{}{(Mordino has Robobrain led away while counting your money.) Here.}
{416}{}{(Mordino has the cyberdog led away while counting your money.) Here.}
{417}{}{Would you like to see what else I have in stock?}
{418}{}{Thank you, Senor Mordino. By the way, I had some questions I wanted to ask you...}
{419}{}{Thank you, Senor Mordino. I hope the slave serves you well. Goodbye.}
{430}{}{(Sweat trickles down Mordino's face. His expression darkens.) You are a dog, and a SON of a dog. I will not buy
 from the likes of you. Leave... and do NOT return.}
{431}{}{Senor Mordino, please... reconsider...}
{432}{}{(Leave quietly.)}
{440}{}{(Mordino studies you.) Very well. I... have work for you. Take... (Takes a deep wheezing breath, wipes sweat from his forehead.)
 ...this package... to the *stables* north of Reno. Give it to a man... Ramirez, then return.}
{441}{}{Okay. Sounds easy enough.}
{442}{}{I will go there now, Senor Mordino.}
{443}{}{What's in the package?}
{444}{}{Uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'll pass.}
{450}{}{I... do not pay you... to ask questions.}
{451}{}{Well, I'd like to know what I'm carrying before I drop it off. Is it dangerous?}
{452}{}{Nevermind then. I'm off.}
{460}{}{Head north up Virgin street, past the casinos... follow the trail that leads outside of town. You will... come to the
 Stables. Now go.}
{461}{}{(Follow his directions...)}
{470}{}{Have... you done as I asked?}
{471}{}{No, I haven't delivered the package yet.}
{472}{}{Yes, I delivered it to Ramirez as you asked.}
{473}{}{Yes, I've been to the Stables and dropped off your package... do you know what they DO there? They're torturing
 slaves with drugs.}
{474}{}{Yes, I gave your package to that guard, Ramirez... you know that guy's a jethead? He was REEKING of Jet fumes.}
{480}{}{Then... why are you here? (Big Jesus wipes his forehead, then takes a deep breath.) WHY did you not deliver the package?}
{481}{}{Well, I had some questions first...}
{482}{}{I'm going to go do it right now.}
{483}{}{Uh, you know what? I think I'll take care of it right now...}
{490}{}{(Nods.) Very well. Here is... your payment. A hundred... chips. For a... simple delivery... it is
 more than enough.}
{491}{}{It's better than nothing, I guess.}
{492}{}{Thank you, Senor Mordino.}
{500}{}{(Squints angrily. A bead of sweat trickles down the side of his face.) They are... cattle. No more.}
{501}{}{You monster... you just signed your own death warrant.}
{502}{}{Uh... just checking. About my payment...}
{510}{}{I have no more... work for you. (Nods at the door.) I wish to be alone. Leave now... and do NOT return.}
{511}{}{Aw, c'mon. There must be SOME other job that I could do...}
{512}{}{Okej.}
{520}{}{I... have more work for you. I need someone... (He takes a deep wheezing breath, then wipes sweat from his forehead.) ... to collect
 my percentage from the... Corsican Brothers. They are LATE in their payments.}
{523}{}{I think I'll pass. Thanks anyway.}
{530}{}{Head north up Virgin street. They are across from the gym... if they give you trouble... if they make excuses... HURT them.}
{531}{}{Okay. I'm on it.}
{532}{}{Very well, Senor Mordino.}
{540}{}{I said you could... HURT the Corsican Brothers. I did not give you permission to... KILL them.}
{541}{}{Hey, look... they started throwing down, and I just defended myself...}
{542}{}{They were saying bad things about your mother, Big Jesus. I HAD to kill them.}
{543}{}{Oh. Guess I misheard.}
{551}{}{Uh... yes, but I don't have the money on me. Just give me some time, and I'll return it to you.}
{552}{}{Yes, here is the money.}
{553}{}{No, not yet.}
{554}{}{No, uh, I'll go take care of it now.}
{560}{}{Then... why are you here? (He wipes his forehead, then takes a deep breath.) WHY do you not have the money?}
{561}{}{Well, you see, I had some questions first...}
{562}{}{Good question. I'm going to go do it right now.}
{570}{}{(Nods as you give him the money.) Here. Half... is yours. Heh. They had already paid me this month, but I like
 to keep them... on their toes.}
{571}{}{Hey, thanks, Big Jesus.}
{580}{}{(Senor Mordino looks at you for a long time, then nods slightly.) I have one last job for you. There... (Takes
 a deep wheezing breath, wipes sweat from his forehead.)... is a MAN who must die.}
{581}{}{He's as good as dead. The corpse got a name?}
{582}{}{Who is this man?}
{583}{}{Who is this man you wish dead, Senor Mordino?}
{584}{}{Whoa, nobody say anything about murder. Forget it.}
{585}{}{I cannot take this job, Senor Mordino, I'm sorry. Goodbye.}
{595}{}{You come to me for work. I give you... work and you complain like a CHILD. (Takes a deep, rasping breath, then coughs.)
 You... are no longer welcome here... in my casino. Leave.}
{596}{}{You come to me for work. You refuse my... offer. (Takes a deep, rasping breath, then coughs.)
 You... are no longer welcome here... in my casino. Leave.}
{597}{}{Before I go, I had some questions I wanted to ask you...}
{598}{}{I'm not done TALKING to you yet, "Big Jesus."}
{599}{}{My apologies, Senor Mordino. I will leave at once.}
{600}{}{Why don't you MAKE me leave?}
{610}{}{This man, Louis Salvatore... he has killed many of my men... many PROUD men of the Mordino family. He... butchered them
 in the street like... dogs. (His hand clenches into a fist.) It is my will that this man die.}
{611}{}{If you got the chips, he's good as dead.}
{612}{}{Wait a minute. Louis Salvatore who rules the Salvatore family? The ones that have the lightbringers that
 can slice men in half?}
{613}{}{I will see the Mordino family avenged, Senor Mordino. I will return when I have completed the task.}
{614}{}{I can't accept this assignment. I'm leaving.}
{615}{}{All right then. I'll do it.}
{620}{}{I shall pay you... when Salvatore breathes no more.}
{621}{}{Wait a minute. Louis Salvatore who rules the Salvatore family? The ones that have the lightbringers that can
 cut men in half?}
{623}{}{I don't stick my neck out for nothing. I'm outta here.}
{630}{}{(Mordino nods, studies your expression.) Does that... make you afraid? If so, leave. (Points at door.) The Mordino
 family has no use for... cowards.}
{631}{}{No, I'll do it.}
{633}{}{Call me a coward, but I like breathing. I'll pass on this job.}
{640}{}{(Nods.) That is good. The man is old... a cripple... he hides in his bar, "Salvatore's," near the Bishop Casino.
 He is a... coward and never leaves his room upstairs. When he is... dead, return.}
{641}{}{Cripple?}
{642}{}{All right.}
{650}{}{(Nods.) The butcher's legs... are weak. (Jesus wipes his forehead, then draws another weak breath.)
 He also has... difficulty... breathing. He takes air through an... oxygen tank.}
{651}{}{Oxygen tank, huh? Hmmmm. All right.}
{652}{}{I'll be back when he is dead, Senor Mordino.}
{660}{}{Louis Salvatore lives. Why have you returned?}
{661}{}{(A bead of sweat trickles down the side of Mordino's face.) You have done as I asked? Louis Salvatore is dead?}
{662}{}{He is dead. Your family is avenged, Senor Mordino.}
{663}{}{No, I shall return when I have killed him.}
{664}{}{Salvatore's too well-guarded. I'm going to have to cancel on this job.}
{670}{}{If you... run from this job, I will have you... KILLED.}
{671}{}{Since you put it that way, I shall return when he's dead.}
{672}{}{Try anything, and you'll be joining the Mordinos that the Salvatores butchered.}
{680}{}{So I have heard. (Nods respectfully.) You have done... well. My faith in you is not misplaced. Here is... your
 payment. Five hundred... chips. }
{681}{}{Tack.}
{682}{}{That'll do... for now.}
{683}{}{And... armor and a weapon you may find... useful.}
{690}{}{(Nods.) Your success... pleases me. I would welcome you into the Family Mordino. (Clasps your shoulders.) Will
 you join our family? Your strength shall be... our strength.}
{691}{}{It would please me to become a member of Family Mordino.}
{692}{}{I can't join the Mordinos. But don't get me wrong, Big Jesus: It was a pleasure working with you.}
{693}{}{I don't want to join, thanks. I've got a village I have to save first.}
{700}{}{(Nods.) I'm sorry that is your choice. As I said, your success pleases me... I would hate for your skills
 to be used by one of my... competitors. (Motions to his guards, who reach for their weapons.)}
{710}{}{That is good. Do you have... a name by which you wish to be called? All Mordinos... all Reno... shall
 know this name.}
{711}{}{Yeah, how about...}
{720}{}{... that is a good name. (Nods.) The Mordino name has... weight in New Reno. Visit... the Cat's Paw... New Reno Arms... and
 tell them you are of my family... they will treat you well.}
{730}{}{(Stares at you for a long time, then squints in confusion.) Why... do you ask me this? I have... HEARD what happened. (Wipes
 his brow.) The boy took too much Jet and died.}
{731}{}{That's the problem. The Mordinos are the biggest suppliers of Jet in New Reno. That makes you the ones who will
 take the blame.}
{732}{}{Do you know where he got the Jet?}
{733}{}{All right then. Just asking. I had some other questions...}
{734}{}{I see. I think I better be going.}
{740}{}{(Wheezes, wipes more sweat from his forehead.) If the Wrights had the... SENSE they were born with, they would... know
 we are not the only family with Jet in New Reno. We... do NOT kill children.}
{741}{}{Just adults, huh? I mean, Jet takes a while to kill someone, but it works, right?}
{742}{}{Somebody else might, and they might blacken the Mordino name. You know who might have sold Richard the Jet
 that killed him?}
{743}{}{I see. Look, I had some other questions...}
{744}{}{Thanks for the information, Senor Mordino. I must be going now.}
{750}{}{(Shakes head.) I... know little of the lives of pushers in Reno. (Takes a raspy breath, coughs slightly.) You... might ask
 my son... in the casino, below.}
{751}{}{I will. I had some other questions...}
{752}{}{I will. Thanks, Senor Mordino.}
{760}{}{The temperature does not... agree with me. My breathing is... sometimes difficult. In times of stress or other physical
 activity, I tire quickly. Sometimes, I have chest pains.}
{761}{}{Really? Well, it's good you don't take any methamphetamines or stimulants, then. I had some other questions...}
{762}{}{I see. I better be going now.}
{770}{}{I do not know you... you come to me... without anyone's word to give your offer... weight. (Wipes his brow, then takes
 a deep, rattling breath.) I have NO work for you.}
{771}{}{C'mon, give me a chance. Give me a job, any job... I can do it.}
{780}{}{Not everyone at the Stables... KNOWS they are test subjects.}
{781}{}{Uh... come again?}
{782}{}{Oh. Uh, about my payment then...}
{790}{}{Ramirez let... four slaves escape last month. (Shakes his head slightly.) That is not good. Within the
 hour, the Jet you gave Ramirez will stop his... heart. It is PUNISHMENT.}
{792}{}{You used me to KILL that guy? That's it, Jesus, I'm outta here.}
{850}{}{You have collected Big Jesus's tribute.}
{875}{}{You have assassinated Big Jesus.}
{900}{}{You have become a made man of the Mordino family.}
{925}{}{You have completed the contract hit for Big Jesus.}
{1278}{}{I spoke to your son, Senor Mordino. I'm a slaver, and I'm looking for work.}
{1291}{}{Very well. Are you interested in buying any slaves?}
{1621}{}{Well... all right then. I'll do it.}
{5268}{}{?!! Then COME GET SOME, YOU FAT SON OF A B--}
