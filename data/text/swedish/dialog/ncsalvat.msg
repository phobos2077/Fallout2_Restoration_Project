{100}{}{You see Louis Salvatore.}
{150}{}{You see an elderly, well-dressed gentleman. He is carrying an oxygen tank, and he seems
 to have difficulty breathing.}
{151}{}{You see Louis Salvatore. He is carrying an oxygen tank, and he seems
 to have difficulty breathing.}
{200}{}{*Host*}
{201}{}{::Wheeze::}
{202}{}{*Cough* *Cough*}
{210}{}{Guards! Gu...*cough* *cough*...Guards!}
{215}{}{(Salvatore turns to you with a stone-faced expression. He studies you for a fraction
 of a second, then makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{216}{}{Owwww! Turn down sound! Hurt ears! HURT EARS!}
{217}{}{ME CANT TALK OVER RINGING. TURN OFF, WE TALK}
{218}{}{I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!}
{219}{}{I knew I should have gotten permission first...}
{220}{}{Skit!}
{221}{}{Uh, please tell me that was room service.}
{230}{}{(The elderly man looks up at you. His face is gaunt and covered with liver spots. He is holding
 a breathing mask, which is connected to an oxygen tank by his side.) What... do you want of me?}
{231}{}{Me want... me no know what I want}
{232}{}{Me want}
{233}{}{Jag }
{234}{}{[Wander off.]}
{235}{}{I have information for you.}
{236}{}{I have information for you, Mr. Salvatore.}
{237}{}{I'm looking for a job.}
{238}{}{Mr. Salvatore, you have a reputation for strength and fairness. I want to work for you.}
{239}{}{I wanted to know where you get the lightbringers.}
{240}{}{Word is you had Mr. Wright's son poisoned. Why?}
{241}{}{I think I've entered the wrong room. Pardon me.}
{250}{}{I have told you the reason the boy was killed. It will not leave this room. (Salvatore
 makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{251}{}{(Salvatore studies you for a fraction of a second in disgust, then makes a strange motion with his hand.
 Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{254}{}{I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!}
{270}{}{(Takes a deep breath from his mask, then shakes his head.) You have
 nothing... that I need to know, }
{271}{}{Um, I don't recall introducing myself. How do you know my name?}
{272}{}{Uh, okay. Well then, I'm looking for a job.}
{276}{}{Actually, I seem to have entered the wrong room. Pardon me.}
{290}{}{(Looks at you silently for a minute. He might be either amused at your question
 or irritated... it's hard to tell.) Again, }
{291}{}{Uh... hmmm. Well, uh, I'm looking for a job.}
{305}{}{(Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of... course you
 are. And WHY should I hire you?}
{306}{}{Well, why not? Name a job, I'll do it. I'm hard-working, and I got the skills to
 get things done.}
{307}{}{Whoa. Did I say I was looking for work? I meant to say I was leaving.}
{315}{}{(Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of... course. But
 I require a... token of your good faith. A sample of your... willingness to work for me.}
{316}{}{What do you want me to do?}
{317}{}{What would you have me do, Mr. Salvatore?}
{325}{}{(Shakes his head slightly.) Your naiveté has... no place here. Words are not
 sufficient: You wish to work for Louis Salvatore? Then I must know how much I can rely on you.}
{326}{}{Look, you can COUNT on me.}
{327}{}{Let me prove it, Mr. Salvatore. Assign me a task.}
{335}{}{(Takes a deep breath from the oxygen mask.) There is... a man... who
 has used his... skill with cards to rob me. The sum is... trivial. The insult is not. I want him killed and
 the money he stole returned.}
{336}{}{Who is this thief?}
{338}{}{How much has he stolen?}
{339}{}{It could be a rough assignment: Can I have one of those laser weapons your family uses?}
{340}{}{Uh, I don't do contract hits. I'll be leaving now.}
{350}{}{Mason will have... the details. (Nods at exit.) Go now.}
{351}{}{All right.}
{352}{}{Thank you, Mr. Salvatore. I will go ask Mason.}
{360}{}{Then you are of... no use to me. Leave now.}
{361}{}{Uh, waitaminute... I changed my mind. I'll do it.}
{362}{}{Leave quietly.}
{370}{}{(Narrows his eyes. His next words are delivered in a rasping hiss.)
 ::You have not yet PROVEN yourself.:: Now go see Mason. He will have the... details of your assignment.}
{371}{}{All right, then. Forget the pistols for now.}
{372}{}{I understand, Mr. Salvatore. Forgive my question. I will go see Mason.}
{373}{}{Look: If you aren't going to arm me properly, then I can't continue working for you.}
{380}{}{Talk to Mason. He will have the... details of your assignment.}
{385}{}{(Salvatore looks up at you, takes a breath from the mask.) Have... you disposed of the thief?}
{386}{}{Naw... Lloyd left town with the money.}
{387}{}{Yep. The vultures are probably shitting pieces of him out right now.}
{388}{}{Not yet.}
{389}{}{No, Mr. Salvatore. Lloyd left town with the money.}
{390}{}{Yes. I made an example of him, Mr. Salvatore.}
{391}{}{Not yet, Mr. Salvatore.}
{400}{}{Yet... you told Mason that you had taken care of the assignment.}
{401}{}{Well, yes, but...}
{405}{}{(Puts his fingers together.) And... the money. Has it been recovered?}
{406}{}{No, I couldn't find the money.}
{407}{}{No, Lloyd already spent the money.}
{408}{}{Ja.}
{410}{}{No, Mr. Salvatore, I couldn't find the money.}
{411}{}{No, Mr. Salvatore, Lloyd already spent the money.}
{412}{}{Yes, Mr. Salvatore.}
{420}{}{Your instructions were to recover the money he stole.
 Have you not done this?}
{421}{}{Well, no, because --}
{422}{}{Uh, I have the money --}
{423}{}{Well, you see, I don't --}
{430}{}{I will take the money now.}
{431}{}{Well, I don't have it on me...}
{432}{}{Give him 250 chips.}
{433}{}{Give him 500 chips.}
{434}{}{Give him 750 chips.}
{435}{}{Give him 1000 chips.}
{436}{}{Give him 1000 chips. (This is the correct amount.)}
{437}{}{(Make a break for it.)}
{450}{}{This amount... is not the amount that was stolen
 from me. Perhaps you don't know how much was stolen from me. Or perhaps you are holding
 out on me. Either way...}
{451}{}{Oh, well, I must have miscounted...}
{455}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money, but he holds up his hands halfway
 through the transaction.) The... remaining half is yours.}
{456}{}{Hey, thanks.}
{468}{}{Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.}
{475}{}{(Mr. Salvatore takes a breath from the mask.) I have another... matter that requires your attention.}
{476}{}{Sure, why not? What's the job -- another kill and fetch assignment?}
{477}{}{I am interested in the job, Mr. Salvatore. What do you want me to do?}
{478}{}{No, I'm done doing hit jobs. I'm making a clean break.}
{479}{}{No more jobs for me, Mr. Salvatore. I have to be going.}
{485}{}{A constituent in my... district has not paid me... tribute... for the services I provide.
 Collect it. If he objects, inform him you are my... representative in this matter. Talk to
 Mason for the details.}
{487}{}{Yes, Mr. Salvatore. I'll go see him.}
{488}{}{No thanks, I don't do extortion jobs.}
{495}{}{You are... lying to me. I know that he still lives.}
{500}{}{Have you done as I asked?}
{501}{}{Yes, Mr. Salvatore, I have the tribute you asked me to collect.}
{502}{}{Yeah, the 'tribute' is right here.}
{503}{}{Not yet. I haven't got the old guy to cough it up yet.}
{504}{}{Not yet, Mr. Salvatore. When I return, I shall have it with me.}
{515}{}{You told Mason you had collected my tribute. Have you not done this?}
{525}{}{Very well. (He waits.)}
{527}{}{Give him 900 chips.}
{528}{}{Give him 800 chips.}
{529}{}{Actually, I don't have the tribute ON me...}
{540}{}{This amount... is not the amount that was stolen
 from me. Perhaps you don't know how much the required tribute is. Or perhaps you are
 holding out on me. Either way...}
{545}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done... well. You have
 earned 25% of the cut.}
{546}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done... adequately. You have
 earned 10% of the cut.}
{555}{}{(Takes a breath from his mask.) You have... done as I asked. I have no
 further need of your... services. (Points to the exit.) Leave now.}
{556}{}{Uh... okay.}
{557}{}{Could I have one of those laser pistols as part of my payment before I go?}
{565}{}{(Takes a deep breath from the mask.) I have another... matter that I could
 use your assistance with.}
{566}{}{Sure, why not? What's the job - more extortion?}
{568}{}{No, I'm done doing extortion jobs. I'm making a clean break.}
{575}{}{A... sensitive transaction will be taking place soon. I am in need of an extra... guard
 to insure that the transaction goes smoothly. You will speak with Mason and do as he directs you.}
{576}{}{What is this transaction?}
{577}{}{Where is this transaction taking place?}
{578}{}{Can I have one of those laser weapons you use?}
{579}{}{I can't do this mission right now, Mr. Salvatore. I must be going.}
{585}{}{Mason will have... the details. Go now.}
{595}{}{Yesss. This time, yes. But you will
 carry other armaments as well. Talk to Mason about the details. He will give you
 one of the lightbringers.}
{596}{}{All right, then.}
{605}{}{Sit, }
{607}{}{I would be honored, Mr. Salvatore.}
{608}{}{I can't. I have other obligations. Thanks for the offer, though.}
{610}{}{I would be honored, Mr. Salvatore, but I cannot. I have other duties to another
 family... notably, my mother.}
{615}{}{That is... unfortunate. I cannot take the risk that you will remain... silent about
 what you have seen in the desert. Goodbye, }
{616}{}{Whoa! Wait a minute...!}
{617}{}{Oh yeah? Bring it on so I can slaughter your entire family, one by one.}
{620}{}{Very well. You must choose a name...}
{621}{}{How about...}
{630}{}{(Nods) That is a... good name. Now go speak to Mason. He will have...
something for you.}
{640}{}{Hälsningar,}
{645}{}{I have no further need of your services, }
{650}{}{...}
{651}{}{...hurkkk...}
{652}{}{...*gasp*...I...*cough*...*wheeze*...}
{653}{}{...no... I...*hurrkkk*}
{654}{}{...help...*gasp*...please...}
{655}{}{...have... mercy...}
{656}{}{*wheeze*}
{657}{}{...I...}
{658}{}{...I...}
{659}{}{::Stops breathing.::}
{660}{}{Heh-heh. I love killing old people.}
{675}{}{(Mr. Salvatore looks at you for a long time in silence, then speaks.) We
 Salvatores... we will rule New Reno. If a child must die to insure that, it will
 be... done. There is no other reason.}
{676}{}{What did killing Wright's son have to do with ruling New Reno? That makes no SENSE.}
{677}{}{You murdered someone's SON, Salvatore. You might as well have just signed
 your own death warrant...}
{678}{}{All right then. I just wanted to know why you did it.}
{800}{}{You have assassinated Boss Salvatore.}
{825}{}{You have whacked Boss Salvatore.}
{850}{}{You have resolved the Lloyd "situation".}
{875}{}{You have collected Mr. Salvatore's tribute.}
{900}{}{You have become a made man of the Salvatore family.}
{925}{}{You have successfully completed the secret transaction.}
{5233}{}{! Who yu}
{5270}{}{. Now... what do you WANT of me?}
{5290}{}{: What... do you WANT of me?}
{5605}{}{. You have done... all I have asked. I would like you to join the Salvatore Family
 and become... one of my made men.}
{5640}{}{.}
{5645}{}{.}
