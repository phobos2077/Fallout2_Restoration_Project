{100}{}{You see... a red-haired heroine model.}
{101}{}{You see a strikingly attractive red-haired woman in a Vault 13 jumpsuit. She is glaring angrily

{102}{}{You see a red-haired heroine model. She is glaring into the distance.}
{103}{}{You see a red-haired heroine model. She is glaring into the distance.}
{104}{}{I can't believe I didn't make the final cut in Fallout 1.}
{105}{}{They chose that black-haired *strumpet* instead. Of all the nerve!}
{106}{}{A *black-haired* female model. Can you get any more generic? BOR-ing.}
{107}{}{Redheads are infinitely more interesting.}
{108}{}{That black-haired female model got in only because she slept with *every* artist on the team.}
{109}{}{AND the programmers.}
{110}{}{AND the project leader. They're soooo easily swayed. Show a little skin, and their spines turns to
 rubber.}
{111}{}{So I get shafted and end up being "filler NPCs" in Vault 13. Keee-rist. Talk about typecasting.}
{112}{}{I'm surprised they rendered that black-haired female model with any clothes.}
