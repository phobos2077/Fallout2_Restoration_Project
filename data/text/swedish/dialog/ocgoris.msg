{100}{}{You see a robed figure.}
{101}{}{You see Goris the scholar.}
{102}{}{You see a humanoid figure wearing a long sleeved, hooded robe. There is something unnatural
 about his stance, but you're not sure exactly what it is.}
{103}{}{Hello, I'm Goris. I don't recognize you; are you new here?}
{104}{}{Me}
{105}{}{Me go.}
{106}{}{Yeah, so what?}
{107}{}{Hi. I'm}
{108}{}{Hello, Goris. Gruthar said I should look you up. He seems to think you're the man with the
 answers.}
{109}{}{Can I ask you some questions?}
{110}{}{Sorry, gotta go.}
{111}{}{It's a pleasure to meet you,}
{112}{}{So you've talked with Gruthar. He has a rather inflated opinion of me. I don't really know half
 as much as he thinks I do. Anyway...}
{113}{}{So you're an outsider! I've seen a few like you; some are staying here in the vault, but you
 look different. You appear to be more 'seasoned,' if you know what I mean. I'll bet you've been around
 a bit and accomplished things. Am I right?}
{114}{}{Uh... 'seasoned'?}
{115}{}{Me go.}
{116}{}{Sorry, but I think I'll be leaving.}
{117}{}{Yes, I've had some adventures. Say, if you wouldn't mind answering some questions for me, I
 could tell you some of my adventures in return.}
{118}{}{None of your business.}
{119}{}{Mind if I ask you some questions?}
{120}{}{It's a deal! I would love to hear anything you can tell me.}
{121}{}{Besides, I couldn't refuse a friend of Gruthar.}
{122}{}{What would you like to know?}
{123}{}{What are you doing here?}
{124}{}{Are you a prisoner here?}
{125}{}{How long have you been here?}
{126}{}{What can you tell me about the deathclaws here?}
{127}{}{Do you know what happened to the people who used to live here in the vault?}
{128}{}{What can you tell me about Gruthar?}
{129}{}{Do you think the deathclaws are a threat to humans?}
{130}{}{Do you have any information on this Enclave you spoke of?}
{131}{}{What do you know about this virus?}
{132}{}{You mentioned you wanted to do some traveling. How about joining me?}
{133}{}{Sorry, but I've got to go now.}
{134}{}{Hmm... I'm surprised Gruthar didn't tell you about me. Oh well. }
{135}{}{I'm a student of sorts. I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the world and the different
 cultures that have developed. Right now I'm studying the culture the deathclaws are forming and
 comparing it to human development along similar lines. I've acquired just about all the information I
 need here. It would help my research a great deal if I could do some traveling. However, I don't want
 to go it alone, if you know what I mean.}
{136}{}{Interesting. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{137}{}{So, you're a scholar. That's quite an accomplishment in today's world.}
{138}{}{How boring. Oh, well... it's your life to waste as you see fit. I need more info, though.}
{139}{}{No, I can leave any time I like. I haven't done so because I don't want to travel alone. I'm
 pretty tough and can take care of myself, but I would still be one person alone in the desert if
 anything happened.}
{140}{}{I see.}
{141}{}{Ah, too much of a wimp to make it on your own. I got it.}
{142}{}{I don't like traveling alone either, so I can't blame you.}
{143}{}{Uh... a few months actually. I came here from the coast a while back.}
{144}{}{Wow, you're pretty new here yourself. If you don't mind, I need to know more.}
{145}{}{You weren't long on that answer. Care to tell me more?}
{146}{}{I see. I need to ask a couple more questions.}
{147}{}{These aren't your average deathclaws, as I'm sure you noticed. They've had their intelligence
 enhanced by some means not understood by them. It was done by a group of humans known as 'The
 Enclave.' It seems this Enclave needed an army and they chose deathclaws because of their ferocity,
 physical prowess, and... well, you get the picture. Anyway, the only thing lacking in deathclaws was
 their intelligence. They needed to be smart enough to understand complex commands, but not so smart
 that they'd be a threat to 'those in charge.'}
{148}{}{That sounds like the biggest crock of shit I've ever heard in my life!}
{149}{}{That's incredible. You seem very knowledgeable. Can I ask you more?}
{150}{}{Hmm... Okay.}
{151}{}{::sigh:: They were captured by The Enclave. Gruthar and the pack were forced to aid in their
 capture. They had no choice since they were slaves at the time. The fate of the humans has weighed
 heavily on Gruthar's mind. He's never really forgiven himself for his complicity in the affair. The
 humans were taken alive, but who knows what has happened to them since?}
{152}{}{(Sigh) They were captured by a group called 'The Enclave.' Gruthar and the pack were forced to

{153}{}{Hmm... I need to ask some more questions.}
{154}{}{I knew the damn deathclaws were responsible somehow! I need some more information, though.}
{155}{}{Sometimes we're forced into doing distasteful things by situations outside of our control.
 Gruthar should learn to forgive himself.}
{156}{}{Gruthar is not the monster that he appears to be. He genuinely cares about all of us here, and
 is doing everything he can to ensure our safety and survival. All of us trust him with our lives. I
 don't know what else I can say about him. You would have to get to know him and judge for yourself.}
{157}{}{I'll not make any snap decisions about him. He deserves better.}
{158}{}{Sure. Let's talk about some other things.}
{159}{}{He's a deathclaw. I find it hard to believe that he can have any redeeming qualities.}
{160}{}{Well... the potential is there, especially when you take their new intelligence into account.
 However, I don't think that Gruthar and his pack pose a threat. They all seem to respect life and
 personal freedom above all else. Now, I don't expect you to take my word on this. I would ask you to
 judge for yourself. There are others who live here whom you can ask your questions.}
{161}{}{Only a dumbass would fail to see the threat potential of these deathclaws!}
{162}{}{Thanks for the advice; I will ask around. Can I ask you a few more questions, though?}
{163}{}{Hmm... Okay, how about a few more questions?}
{164}{}{No, only what I've told you. Wait, there is one other thing. The Enclave showed an interest in some ruins to the west of here. Why, I don't know. That's about it.}
{165}{}{Well, every little bit of information helps, and I thank you for it.}
{166}{}{This happens to be a very important subject to me and you've let me down!}
{167}{}{I see.}
{168}{}{I think it's called the FEV virus. The Enclave is, or was, doing extensive research on it. I'm
 sorry, but I don't know anything more.}
{169}{}{That's okay; on to other things.}
{170}{}{You should be sorry. I was told you were a font of knowledge!}
{171}{}{You've been more than helpful, Goris.}
{172}{}{I've kept my part of our bargain and answered all of your questions. Now, how about those
 adventure stories you promised?}
{173}{}{Gladly. It's a pleasure to talk to you.}
{174}{}{Promise? What promise?}
{175}{}{Yeah, sure.}
{176}{}{(Goris hesitates and you get the feeling you are being carefully scrutinized.) I would be
 honored to join you!}
{177}{}{(Goris hesitates and you get the feeling you are being carefully scrutinized.) I'm sorry, but I
 don't think that you and I share the same ideals. A joint venture would not be in our best interest.}
{178}{}{Okay, you lose.}
{179}{}{I understand. Perhaps you'll reconsider later.}
{180}{}{What? I'm not good enough for your company? Screw you!}
{181}{}{Ok, I understand.}
{182}{}{I have nothing to say to you. Do not bother me again.}
{183}{}{I asked you not to bother me again. Perhaps violence is the only language you understand.}
{184}{}{}
{185}{}{Yeah, you know, well traveled... knowledgeable... experienced... You don't have a clue what I'm
 talking about, do you? }
{186}{}{Food seasoned, not me.}
{187}{}{Jag g√• nu.}
{188}{}{Uh huh. Well, your IQ may be smaller than your shoe size, but you obviously have something
 going for you to have survived in the world this long... Ok, let's try this. Me want leave this place.
 Me want travel with you. Ok?}
{189}{}{Uh huh. Well, your IQ may be smaller than your shoe size but you obviously have something going
 for you to have survived in the world this long... it must be that mean streak I can sense in you. Oh,
 well. Good-bye.}
{190}{}{Uh... Okay.}
{191}{}{Me go.}
{192}{}{I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry into your private affairs.}
{193}{}{Yeah, well, see that you don't do it again!}
{194}{}{Whatever. I need some information from you, though.}
{195}{}{I'm sorry, Goris. I'm a bit jumpy today. I wanted to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.}
{196}{}{You have had some interesting times. You are the stuff that heroes are made from, and I
 envy you. Thanks for telling me everything.}
{197}{}{Well... you are a walking quest for carnage, and I think I'll be going now. Thanks, and bye!}
{198}{}{You're welcome, Goris.}
{199}{}{Hello again. What's up?}
{200}{}{You come me?}
{201}{}{Uh... me lost. Me go.}
{202}{}{Just thought I'd stop by and say hello. See ya later.}
{203}{}{Hey, I'm looking for a traveling companion. You up for it?}
{204}{}{What can I do for you,}
{205}{}{You bad thing! Why no tell?}
{206}{}{You're a deathclaw? Is there a reason you didn't mention this to me?}
{207}{}{How do I put this... Bad thing you kill, no talk. Me not tell you so you see me good thing. Not
 kill me. Okay me stay with you?}
{208}{}{I'm sorry to have deceived you, but humans have a habit of shooting deathclaws on sight. I felt
 that it would be to my advantage to hide my identity until you could see for yourself that I am on your
 side in this venture. If you want me to leave, I'll do so. But I would rather stay and help you on your
 quest. I want to show that humans and deathclaws can work together as friends, not enemies.}
{209}{}{Me not like, you go.}
{210}{}{Okay, you stay.}
{211}{}{I'm sorry, but I don't like being deceived. You should leave.}
{212}{}{I understand why you felt it necessary to hide your identity. I think we can work together, so
 please stay -- but don't deceive me again, Goris.}
{213}{}{. Me new here.}
{214}{}{. Yes, I'm from outside the vault.}
{215}{}{.}
{216}{}{?}
{217}{}{So, the Enclave started messing with a virus, or some such thing, and injected the deathclaws
 with it. This virus was known to mutate humans into some sort of super beings, so the Enclave wanted
 to see what it would do to deathclaws. Well, the result was a breed of deathclaws so smart that they
 could see they were destined for slavery. So, they played dumb until they could gain their freedom.
 And here they are!}
{218}{}{I am against attacking any deathclaw.}
{219}{}{I suddenly sense that my pack is in trouble. I am sorry to leave you, but I must check on my brothers.}
{220}{}{Okej.}
{221}{}{The security cameras recorded what has happened. You should go check it.}
{222}{}{You see a gray deathclaw. It's Goris.}
{223}{}{You see a humanoid figure wearing a long sleeved, hooded robe. It's Goris.}
{1000}{}{Yes,}
{1001}{}{You heal you self.}
{1002}{}{You wait here. I be back and get.}
{1003}{}{Uh... no weapon now. Okay?}
{1008}{}{You D'claw? Why you no tell?}
{1009}{}{Me done.}
{1010}{}{You should heal yourself now.}
{1011}{}{I need you to wait here until I come back.}
{1012}{}{Make sure you don't have a weapon ready, Okay?}
{1016}{}{Let's go.}
{1017}{}{You're a deathclaw? Is there a reason you didn't mention this to me before?}
{1018}{}{That's it for now.}
{1019}{}{I'm healed and ready to go,}
{1020}{}{I'm almost completely healed,}
{1021}{}{I'm mostly healed, but I could use some assistance when we get the chance,}
{1022}{}{I've healed myself as much as I can, but I'm still pretty badly hurt,}
{1041}{}{I'll be waiting here for you when you get back,}
{1060}{}{I do my best to look inconspicuous,}
{1064}{}{You stay close.}
{1065}{}{You no get far away.}
{1066}{}{You too close. Spread out.}
{1073}{}{Stay close to me.}
{1074}{}{Don't get too far away.}
{1075}{}{We should spread out a bit.}
{1078}{}{That's it for now.}
{1079}{}{I'll stay as close as I can,}
{1098}{}{I'll move out a bit and give you room to breathe,}
{1117}{}{I'll hang back and give you some room,}
{1136}{}{I'm sorry,}
{1137}{}{I've learned a lot from our travels together. I'll gladly come with you, }
{1156}{}{? }
{1157}{}{. }
{1158}{}{, but you've got too many people with you now. I'll wait here until a position opens.}
{1159}{}{I think I will do better on my own.}
{1160}{}{Your not anyone I want to be around I am leaving.}
{1161}{}{I wish to avenge my brethren.}
{1162}{}{All right. Let's do it.}
{1163}{}{Maybe you should do this one on your own.}
{1164}{}{You right we kill.}
{1165}{}{You go alone.}
{1166}{}{Lets change up the distance between us.}
{1167}{}{Me think you need to move different.}
{2000}{}{I think I broke a limb. Medical assistance is required.}
{2001}{}{I believe I am suffering from radiation poisoning. Do you have anything to aid me?}
{2002}{}{I believe I have been poisoned. Do you have anything to aid me?}
