{100}{}{You see a mercenary captain.}
{150}{}{You see a rugged looking man dressed in combat armor. His armor and weapons look well-maintained, almost new.}
{151}{}{You see a mercenary captain. He is scanning the area and fingering his weapon.}
{200}{}{Well, look at the brass balls on this son of a bitch...}
{201}{}{Contact!}
{202}{}{We got us an intruder, boys!}
{203}{}{Scramble, boys, we got an intruder!}
{204}{}{Well, look who stopped in ta die...}
{205}{}{Damn! Somebody found us!}
{206}{}{You got some sand comin' in here...}
{207}{}{You just walked into the *wrong* place, bitch.}
{208}{}{Well, look at the swagger on this bitch...}
{215}{}{Better call those killer teams in soon...}
{216}{}{I think Bravo team is a few klicks south of Vault City... they're still tracking that caravan.}
{217}{}{That desert cherry better shape up soon... that sort of shit won't wash around here.}
{218}{}{Almost time to send some men to check the perimeter...}
{219}{}{If we could only sabotage those Vault City laser cannons...}
{220}{}{Still waiting for word from Bishop...}
{221}{}{Been a week since Bishop sent a messenger.}
{222}{}{I figure the next caravan ought to be from NCR to Vault City...}
{223}{}{We gotta be ready to move out at a moment's notice.}
{224}{}{Hope those boys checked the traps.}
{225}{}{Have Alpha and Bravo team checked back in yet?}
