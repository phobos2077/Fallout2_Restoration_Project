{100}{}{You see a larger-than-average ghoul.}
{101}{}{You see Zomak, known to some as the Destroyer.}
{102}{}{You see a big, burly ghoul whose face, beneath a sharply sloping forehead, reflects vast
 reserves of simpleminded superiority.}
{110}{}{Renew, comrade! I am Zomak. Some call me Zomak the Destroyer. What is your business here?}
{111}{}{Renew, comrade! What are you doing here? State your business to Zomak the Destroyer.}
{112}{}{Renu!}
{113}{}{Ook?}
{114}{}{I'm just looking around.}
{115}{}{I wish to Renew.}
{116}{}{I took a wrong turn.}
{120}{}{You should look somewhere else, or Zomak will show you the stars.}
{130}{}{Then you must see him.}
{131}{}{Him? Where is him, I mean he?}
{132}{}{I'm not worthy of seeing him. Goodbye.}
{140}{}{He is the granter of enlightenment. It is he that promises Renewal to all who follow him.}
{141}{}{Well, I'm just about due for Renewal. Where is he?}
{142}{}{Sounds like another nutcase to me. I'm outta here.}
{150}{}{Well, he's right back... Hey! Just who are you, anyway?}
{151}{}{I'm just a wanderer.}
{152}{}{I am the Chosen One.}
{153}{}{I'm just here for my annual renewal.}
{154}{}{It'll be okay. I just have to ask him a couple of questions.}
{160}{}{Well, wander on out of here, then.}
{161}{}{Uh, okay. Goodbye.}
{170}{}{Well, in that case... Come on in. He's right in the next room. Don't keep him waiting.}
{171}{}{Not me. I'll go right in. Goodbye.}
{172}{}{I might come back later. Goodbye.}
{180}{}{Well, you should choose to leave. Get out of here.}
{181}{}{Okej.}
{200}{}{Yes, you can all Renew inside.}
{201}{}{Okej.}
{210}{}{Ook? What do you mean by that? Are you dumb?}
{211}{}{Goop?}
{220}{}{Get out of here. The Brain doesn't have time for the likes of you.}
{221}{}{Okay. I'll be going now.}
{230}{}{There's nothing else down here but the Brain's lair. Boy, are you dumb.}
{231}{}{The Brain?}
{232}{}{I was just testing you. You passed. Now let me in.}
{233}{}{I guess I got confused. Must be all this radiation. Goodbye.}
{240}{}{Oops. Uh, there's nothing here. Nothing at all. Just go away now.}
{241}{}{You're sure there's nothing here?}
{242}{}{Okay. Goodbye.}
{250}{}{Yup. I'm sure. Now get out.}
{251}{}{Well, if you say so. Goodbye.}
{260}{}{Oh, heh, heh... yeah. I knew that. Umm, well, er, did I pass? }
{261}{}{You sure did. Now let me in.}
{262}{}{No, you failed, and now I have to report you.}
{270}{}{Okay, then. You can go right in.}
{271}{}{Okay. Goodbye.}
{280}{}{You have the sign. Go right in.}
{281}{}{Gooo.}
{282}{}{The sign?}
{283}{}{Fear the sign. Goodbye.}
{290}{}{Yes, the sacred talisman of Renewal. Renew, comrade! Renew!}
{291}{}{Yes... Reno to you, too. Goodbye.}
{300}{}{Renew, brother. You may pass.}
{301}{}{Renew, sister. You may pass.}
