{120}{}{You repaired the air purifier.}
{125}{}{You destroyed the air purifier.}
{129}{}{The conspirators can no longer send the destruct signal to the explosive switch. It is useless, so you throw it away.}
{130}{}{It is already fixed.}
{131}{}{Clunk}
{132}{}{Creak}
{133}{}{Clank}
{134}{}{Whirrrrrrrr}
