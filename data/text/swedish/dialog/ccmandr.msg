{100}{}{You see someone in power armor. }
{101}{}{You see the Navarro base Commander.}
{102}{}{You see someone wearing power armor of an unusual design. There is an insignia on the breastplate that you are unfamiliar with.}
{103}{}{Who the hell are you guys... Alert! Intruders on the base!}
{104}{}{I don't have time to chitchat with the grunts. You're dismissed.}
{105}{}{Time to die.}
{106}{}{Okej.}
{107}{}{I told you I don't have time for you. Leave this office and do not come back here unless I send for you. Dismissed!}
{108}{}{Disobeying a direct order of a superior officer is treason. I don't have time to court martial you so I'll handle this myself. Guards! Kill this idiot!}
{109}{}{Okej.}
{110}{}{Screw you!}
{111}{}{The Fob is in the locker over there. Have the duty officer contact me once it's secured. Dismissed!}
{112}{}{Yes sir!}
{113}{}{Make it quick soldier, I don't have all day to stand around.}
{114}{}{Yes sir!}
{115}{}{Leave my locker alone or I will dish out some serious pain.}
{116}{}{Yes sir!}
{117}{}{This base is on alert and I don't recognize you. Show me your papers, soldier.}
{118}{}{What papers?}
{119}{}{You blow me!}
{120}{}{I don't seem to have them with me...}
{121}{}{Papers? I've got your papers right here!}
{122}{}{Wrong answer, maggot. You're to carry your papers with you at all times. You should know that!}
{123}{}{Fuck you.}
{124}{}{Leave my locker alone or I will dish out some serious pain.}
{125}{}{Time to die.}
{200}{}{Alright, let's get this over with--I don't like muties stinking up my office, and I got shit to do. Do you work
 for the Salvatores? }
{201}{}{None of your business, asshole.}
{202}{}{I work for no one.}
{203}{}{So what if I do?}
{204}{}{Yeah, I work for the Salvatores.}
{205}{}{Before I answer any questions, I've got a few of my own.}
{210}{}{I don't have time for this bullshit. Guards! Kill this mutie!}
{220}{}{So you're saying you're nothing more than a stray wasteland rat that happened to wander into one of our vertibirds?}
{221}{}{Uh, yeah, pretty much . . . except for that part about me being a rat.}
{222}{}{That's right.}
{223}{}{No, I'm saying that this is all just a big misunderstanding. I don't know who you guys are, and I don't care.
 So if you don't mind, I'll be moving along now.}
{230}{}{Good, if you're acting alone, then I don't have to waste another second of my time with you. Guards! Kill this mutie!}
{240}{}{You're not leaving here alive, mutant. I couldn't risk you blabbing the location of this base to all your
 wasteland friends, now could I? Guards! Kill this mutie!}
{250}{}{Tell me what I want to know, and I'll make sure your death is quick and . . . relatively painless.
 Did Salvatore put you up to this?}
{251}{}{Uhh . . . no? Wait, yeah. Maybe.}
{252}{}{Nope. Playing hide-and-seek in your flying machine was all my own idea. Genius, I know.}
{253}{}{Yeah, he thought he'd sweeten the trade by sending me along. What a deal, huh?}
{254}{}{Before I answer any questions, I've got a few of my own.}
{260}{}{I don't have time for this bullshit. Guards! Kill this mutie!}
{270}{}{That supposed to be funny, mutant? I think you'll be a lot funnier to me when you're a bleeding corpse. Guards!
 Kill this mutie!}
{280}{}{Oh, you do? [He chuckles.] Well hell, why not? You're dying anyway. What do you want to know, mutant?}
{281}{}{Why do you keep calling me a mutant?}
{282}{}{Who the hell are you guys?}
{283}{}{Where am I? }
{284}{}{How can I get some of that sweet armor?}
{285}{}{I've heard enough.}
{290}{}{Because you ARE. Sure, you might look kinda human, but don't let that fool you. You're still a mutant. You and
 everyone else on the mainland. All tainted. Next question?}
{300}{}{We're the Enclave--the last bastion of true humanity on this damn planet. We're the only ones still upholding
 the honor of the ol' red, white, and blue. That's right, we're true patriots. We eat bald eagles and shit stars and
 stripes. We're all that's left of the great United States of America. But we're enough. Oh, yeah, we're enough to set
 things right. You can count on that, mutie. Next question?}
{310}{}{This here's Navarro, our secret mainland base. We're sitting right on the coast of California and the pacific
 ocean. Next question?}
{320}{}{By prying it off my dead body. Good luck with that, mutie. Next question?}
{330}{}{Good, 'cause I'm damn tired of wasting my breath on a mutant. In fact, this whole things a waste of my time,
 because I don't give a flying fuck what you've got to say to me. Guards! Kill this mutie!}
