{100}{}{You see a little grease-stained guy.}
{101}{}{You're looking at Buster, the gun guy.}
{102}{}{This guy's clothes are ragged and he's got gun-bluing all over his hands, arms, and face. Still, he seems pretty cheerful.}
{103}{}{Hey, welcome to Buster's Fine Emporium of Armament! I'm Buster and there ain't nobody else. Got some fine goods for sale here. And if you don't see something you like, then make sure you check out my shelves for additional product. I'm bound to have somethin' that'll tickle yer fancy.}
{104}{}{Hey, back again? What can I do for you?}
{105}{}{Anything else?}
{106}{}{Want gun.}
{107}{}{What do you got?}
{108}{}{Maybe you can fix me up something special?}
{109}{}{I've got some questions.}
{110}{}{Farväl.}
{111}{}{A fine choice!}
{112}{}{Well, you got yourself a steal there, partner.}
{113}{}{Not to rush you, stranger, but I got work to do.}
{114}{}{Sure, stranger, what do you want to know?}
{115}{}{Tell me about NCR.}
{116}{}{What's the deal with Merk?}
{117}{}{What can you tell me about Roger Westin?}
{118}{}{I'm looking for a meeting with Old Man Carlson. Know anybody who could help me?}
{119}{}{Do you have a GECK?}
{120}{}{That's nice, stranger, but I ain't no charity.}
{121}{}{Maybe. Just might have a Triveld x10 rifle scope - would fit just fine on a hunting rifle, if somebody was interested. Let it go cheap -- $500.}
{122}{}{Hey, you already cleaned me out.}
{123}{}{Sure, it's a deal.}
{124}{}{No, thanks.}
{125}{}{New California Republic - that's what it is. President Tandi and the bunch say they're trying to rebuild the old days; I figure they're just trying to grab whatever they can. Hell, I got no complaint with them - the old days is all before my time. They're kind of a prissy bunch, though - don't like slaves, gambling, whatnot. That's why I set up out here. Don't like rules - never have.}
{126}{}{I see.}
{127}{}{Farväl.}
{128}{}{I don't mess with Mr. Merk and it don't pay to go gossiping about him. You got questions, go ask about him at the Rawhide.}
{129}{}{I see.}
{130}{}{Farväl.}
{131}{}{Roger Westin? You mean that Congress guy? Got himself a spread out west of town. Brahmin man - big wheel in the Stockman's Association. He's always looking for hands, if you're wanting work.}
{132}{}{I see.}
{133}{}{Farväl.}
{134}{}{Funny you go asking that after what happened to Roger Westin. Not that I'd know, but there's a fellow - Merk - down at the Rawhide who might be able to help you.}
{135}{}{I see.}
{136}{}{Farväl.}
{137}{}{That one of them pre-war imports? Let me guess, 14mm ammo? Nope, ain't got one.}
{138}{}{I see.}
{139}{}{Farväl.}
{140}{}{Look, I can't do this on anything but a hunting rifle. It's the way the mount's built, understand?}
{141}{}{I see.}
{142}{}{Farväl.}
{143}{}{The joint's closed. Bug off.}
{144}{}{God! Come back at a decent hour, will ya?}
{145}{}{Come back when I'm open - and close the tent flap behind ya.}
{146}{}{I'm closed.}
{147}{}{Look, just get out or Mr. .45 is gonna get unhappy!}
{148}{}{Wrong move, stranger.}
{149}{}{Here is what I have on this shelf. If you need anything else make sure to check out the other shelves also.}
