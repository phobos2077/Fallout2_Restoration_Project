{100}{}{You see Orville Wright.}
{150}{}{You see a well-dressed gentleman. He looks perpetually pissed off. That's probably why his brown hair is graying around the edges.}
{151}{}{You see a grumbling Orville Wright. He looks like he is about to pull out what remains of his hair.}
{152}{}{You see a grumbling Orville Wright. He looks upset and is sighing a lot.}
{200}{}{Get away from there!}
{210}{}{Kids, get away! It's a hitman!}
{211}{}{You're gonna die, you sonuvabitch.}
{212}{}{Come into my house, will you...}
{213}{}{So they send you to do their dirty work...}
{214}{}{You two-bit hitman, this is your last job...}
{220}{}{Marriage ain't a word. It's a life sentence.}
{221}{}{Damn Salvatores...}
{222}{}{Where are those damn kids...}
{223}{}{Anybody seen Christopher around? Tell that boy I want to see him. Now.}
{224}{}{I wonder if our marriage is legally binding...}
{225}{}{Profits this quarter are down... better start watering down the hootch.}
{226}{}{Need more ethyl alcohol. And less Ethyl Wright...}
{227}{}{Salvatores are being quiet...}
{228}{}{Where the hell is that woman? Ethyl! Ethyl!}
{229}{}{Need to stop cursing around the kids...}
{230}{}{We're gonna have to expand distribution if we're gonna stay on the Reno map...}
{231}{}{If Christopher gives me any more backtalk...}
{232}{}{Bring me my book.}
{233}{}{Poor Richard...}
{234}{}{Is a little peace and quiet too much to ask?!! Keep it down!}
{240}{}{(Wrinkles cover this old man's face... it looks like any expression other than a scowl is foreign to him. Only a few brown
 hairs are left in his thick gray hair.) }
{241}{}{Start talking, tribal. Who are you and what do you want?}
{242}{}{Start talking, slaver. Who are you and what do you want?}
{243}{}{Jag }
{244}{}{Boogity boogity}
{245}{}{Yoo Boo Hoo Yooooo}
{246}{}{Kootchie Kootchie Koooo}
{247}{}{Who hell you}
{248}{}{I'm a simple traveler... looking for work.}
{249}{}{The name's }
{250}{}{Actually, I seem to have entered the wrong room. I'll be leaving now.}
{260}{}{(Scowls.) Get outta my sight. You come around here again, I'll have you shot, you hear me?}
{262}{}{Uh-uh}
{263}{}{You kiss mommee with that mouth?}
{264}{}{You betta NOT shoot me. Shooting me just makes me ANGREE}
{265}{}{Go way n' find sumone else to talk to who izint such a meanie}
{275}{}{(When he sees you, Mr. Wright's face breaks into a snarl and he starts shouting.) }
{276}{}{(Mr. Wright's face breaks into a snarl and he starts shouting.) }
{277}{}{Boys! We got a visitor lookin' for a plot of land in Golgotha! Get in here!}
{278}{}{Get in here, boyz! Me wanna play}
{279}{}{Whoa, now hold on...!}
{280}{}{That DOES it! I'm sick of your bullshit. You'll be dead before your little boys can get here.}
{281}{}{They won't get in here in time to save your life...}
{282}{}{Excuse me. Me and the exit have an appointment.}
{290}{}{Yeah, maybe you BETTER leave, and quickly. If you're still here in five seconds, I'll have you shot, you hear me?}
{291}{}{Yeah, seems like you got this habit o' coming in and stepping out. Maybe we better take care of that problem o' yours.}
{292}{}{I'm going.}
{293}{}{What do you m --?}
{294}{}{My thoughts exactly. Time for you to die.}
{300}{}{No SHIT? (Sneers.) Well, pleased to meet you, "simple traveler." Glad you stopped by, damn neighborly of you. (Sneer
 crumbles into a frown as he scopes you out.) Looking for work in family Wright, huh?}
{301}{}{No SHIT? (Sneers.) Well, pleased to meet you, SLAVER. Glad you stopped by, damn neighborly of you. (Sneer crumbles
 into a scowl.) We don't deal with your kind, you hear? Now, get out!}
{302}{}{Yes, I --}
{303}{}{Actually, I seem to have entered the wrong room. Pardon me.}
{304}{}{Hold on a minute, I haven't FINISHED talking to you yet. I...}
{305}{}{All right. Looks like I'll be going.}
{310}{}{No SHIT? (Sneers.) Well, pleased to meet you, "}
{311}{}{Yes, I --}
{320}{}{So happens MY family IS family Wright. Blood thicker than water and all. (Scowls.) }
{321}{}{What makes you think I'd want tribal trash like you in my family? I got all the hitmen I need.}
{322}{}{What makes you think I need a piece of tribal ass like you in my family? I got enough whores to suck off all of Northern Cali.}
{323}{}{Give me a test, then. Let me prove myself.}
{324}{}{Looks like I came to the wrong place. I'll be going now.}
{330}{}{(Studies you for a moment.) All right. Maybe you not being in the family could be a good thing. (Scowl fades.) You got children?}
{331}{}{Not to my knowledge.}
{332}{}{Not to my knowledge. I think I'd remember.}
{340}{}{One of my sons... my boy, Richard, passed away recently. Drug overdose. Jet.}
{341}{}{How can I help?}
{342}{}{Uh... I don't really see how I can --}
{350}{}{I want to know what dealer gave that SHIT to Richard and forced him to take it. Every time I send my boys to find out,
 they turn up nothin'. Maybe somebody who ain't got Wright blood could get some answers.}
{351}{}{Uh, "forced him to take it?"}
{352}{}{I'll take the job.}
{353}{}{No, this job isn't my style. I better be going.}
{360}{}{(Face turns red.) My boys are clean, and they know to stay away from that shit, or I'll kill them. Then SUDDENLY, Richie ODs.
 Someone pumped a ton of Jet in him, so much that fumes was runnin' outta his nose.}
{361}{}{Well... that doesn't mean someone else is responsible. Your son could have taken too much. Jet is highly addictive.}
{362}{}{Hmmm. I'll take the job.}
{370}{}{(Nods.) All right then. Now look: You find that son of a bitch who killed my boy, don't you touch 'im... you just come back
 and TELL me the dead man's name. (Eyes blaze.) I'LL take care of it from there.}
{371}{}{We haven't talked a price.}
{372}{}{Any leads?}
{373}{}{Find the person who gave him the Jet, don't hurt them, just come back and tell you. Got it.}
{380}{}{Yer right, we ain't talked price, cause you ain't done nothing BUT talk. I'm letting you prove your worth. Do your job,
 and you don't need to worry about money. I give you my word as a Wright.}
{383}{}{Forget this, then. Only fools work for nothing. I'm out of here.}
{390}{}{(Eyes blaze.) No... everybody's too scared to talk... to a Wright, anyway. If I were you, I would 'question' some of the Reno
 drug pushers, see what they know. That Jet came from SOMEWHERE.}
{391}{}{Any pushers you suspect?}
{393}{}{Look, this job isn't my style. I better be going.}
{400}{}{You again. You find out who killed my boy?}
{401}{}{Not yet. I'm working on it.}
{402}{}{Yeah, it was Jules, the dealer at the front of town.}
{403}{}{Jagged Jimmy J, the dealer on 2nd Street.}
{404}{}{That old geezer, Renesco the Rocketman.}
{405}{}{Lil' Jesus Mordino. He deals Jet.}
{406}{}{Your son didn't die of an overdose. He was poisoned.}
{415}{}{That so? Word is, the bastard's ALREADY dead, but I ain't telling you nothing new. I TOLD you not to touch him
 - you screwed up. Now, YOU'RE dead.}
{416}{}{Wait --}
{417}{}{Oh, yeah, well --}
{425}{}{That bastard's seen his last days. Come morning, he'll be dead. But he'll be a LONG time dying...}
{426}{}{Now, about the price for doing my work...}
{427}{}{No less than he deserves.}
{428}{}{Uh, but Renesco didn't give Richard the Jet... he didn't know who it was for... it was the SALVATORES
 that poisoned your son.}
{435}{}{I owe you... I owe you. }
{436}{}{Well now, before I get into specifics, let's settle accounts first... }
{437}{}{Here's a little cash for your trouble, plus some ammo, liquor from my private stock... and another
 job for you, if you're interested.}
{438}{}{I'm interested.}
{439}{}{No thanks. I'll see you around.}
{445}{}{If you come back here again and you ain't done what I asked, I'll see you hang in Golgotha, tribal. NO ONE
 wastes my time. You understand me?}
{446}{}{If you think you can jerk me around on this, tribal, you're dead wrong. I've HAD it with your bullshit. (Starts shouting.)
 Boys! Get in here!}
{447}{}{Understood.}
{448}{}{I'm not the one for this job, Mr. Wright. Find somebody else.}
{449}{}{Fuck this job, fuck your dead drug-using son, and fuck you. I'm outta here.}
{451}{}{That DOES it! I'm sick of your bullshit. You'll be joining your dead drug-using son in hell.}
{453}{}{Get out of here.}
{465}{}{It so happens, not too long ago, I came across a map that shows an old army base in the mountains not far from here. You find a way in there, and I'll see that you're taken care of...}
{466}{}{Okee Dokee Mister Orderville}
{467}{}{ go. }
{468}{}{All right. I'll go check it out.}
{469}{}{Why should I go? Didn't you send somebody already?}
{470}{}{Not interested, thanks. Goodbye.}
{471}{}{I already found a way to get inside the base. There's a lot of old weapons
 and military hardware there, all for the taking.}
{472}{}{I already found a way inside the base. Problem is, there was an... accident...
 the base is contaminated.}
{480}{}{(Mr. Wright's expression tightens for a moment, then he snorts.) Heh. Not exactly. The fellas I got the map from are dead.
 They were a tough bunch, but they all got wiped out tryin' to get inside the base.}
{481}{}{They didn't even get INSIDE?}
{485}{}{Yeah, the only survivor said... shortly before his unfortunate death... said that there were some kind of super gun turrets
 guarding the entrance. Wiped out most of his boys.}
{486}{}{What happened to the survivor?}
{487}{}{Hmmmm. I'll have to be careful then. I'll take the job.}
{488}{}{Forget this. No one said it would be that dangerous.}
{495}{}{Oh, ol' Sam Pritchard? Sad story. Got drunk one night, mentioned to my boy Keith he'd found this 'base,' and 'fore y'know
 it, he draws me a map and DIES. He's sleeping in Golgotha now.}
{496}{}{Seems like Reno's filled with sad stories these days. I'll take the job.}
{497}{}{Y'know, it's stories like that that make me realize I really can't take this job. Later, Wright.}
{505}{}{(Shakes his head.) Too bad. You come back and see me if you change your mind.}
{506}{}{I'll do that.}
{515}{}{(Wright smiles when he sees you.) You change your mind about that proposition I had?}
{516}{}{What was this proposition again?}
{517}{}{No, just stopping by. I'll be going now.}
{525}{}{(Nods, smiles.) All right then. Come back when you found a way in, and I'll see you're well rewarded. Now, as for
 the location of the base... head north, then... (Gives you the coordinates for the army base.)}
{526}{}{All right. I'll go check it out. When I find a way inside, I'll be back.}
{535}{}{Ah, it's you. You got some good news for me? You find a way into that army base?}
{536}{}{If you're back and ain't done what I asked, then you're in for a world of hurt.}
{537}{}{Not yet.}
{538}{}{Yes. I managed to get inside and found a lot of old weapons and military hardware there. It's all there for the taking.
 Now, about my payment...}
{539}{}{I got inside the base, but there was an... accident... the base is contaminated.}
{540}{}{Sorry. I'll return once I get inside the Army base.}
{541}{}{Screw this job, and screw you. I'm outta here.}
{550}{}{If you ain't DONE what I asked, then what in HELL are you doing back here?! I need you to crack that base, so don't
 be coming back here until you've done it!}
{551}{}{All right. I'll return once I get inside the Army base.}
{560}{}{If you come back here again and you ain't done what I asked, I'll see you hang in Golgotha, tribal. NO ONE wastes my
 time. You understand me?}
{561}{}{Sorry? SORRY?! That don't cut it this time, tribal. If you think you can waste my time, you're wrong. I can get
 someone else to fill your shoes. (Shouts at door.) Boys! Get in here!}
{562}{}{Understood. I'll be back when I've done the job.}
{575}{}{. I like it, I like it. It's got style. Now you stop on by the Cat's Paw and New Reno Arms, and they'll take care of
 you. You need free hootch, head on by the train station, too. I'll set you up.}
{576}{}{Thanks. I'll do that.}
{580}{}{(Eyes gleam.) You done good, }
{581}{}{An 'accident?' Aw, hell, I don't even want to know. Get outta here and don't ever come back.}
{582}{}{Thanks, Mr. Wright. If I'm a Made Man, then I'd like to be called...}
{583}{}{All right then.}
{584}{}{So what do you want us to call ya?}
{590}{}{(Smiles when he sees you.) }
{591}{}{Sure. How are things with you, Mr. Wright?}
{592}{}{Sure. I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.}
{600}{}{(Chuckles.) Not bad, not bad. My wife is still being a holy terror, but that's nothing new. The joys of marriage.}
{601}{}{I understand. Well, I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.}
{610}{}{Angry? Hell, yes, my goddamn wife just went berserk on one of my stills. Don't know how the hell she found out, but...}
{611}{}{Angry? Hell, yes, some low-down sonuvabitch destroyed one of my stills. Don't know how the hell he pulled it off, but...}
{612}{}{Angry? Hell, yes, my customers are dropping off... literally. Something's wrong with the alcohol, and I think it's killing
 people. I wonder if the fermenting process is poisonous...}
{613}{}{She probably just stumbled across it. Dumb luck, no doubt! I don't think anyone told her, nope. Very unlikely.}
{614}{}{Well, those old machines break down all the time! I don't think anyone did it on purpose. Very unlikely.}
{615}{}{Well, it certainly couldn't have anything to do with radscorpion venom leaking into the vats from a severed radscorpion
 tail being dropped in there. I wouldn't dwell on it.}
{620}{}{Funny you should ask. My son got a gun from somewhere... I think it's one of the other families, trying to get him to shoot
 himself or his old man. When I catch the bastard...}
{621}{}{Uh, a gun? Really? You're right, sir, probably one of the other families gave it to him. Be hard to track down whoever
 did it, though. I wouldn't pay it any mind.}
{625}{}{(Nods.) Probably nothing. Aw, well...}
{626}{}{Sure. Oh, well, I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.}
{630}{}{(Frowns.) Way I see it, it was probably a Mordino pusher... that goddamn family controls nearly all the Jet in Reno.
 I'd scope out the Desperado, see what dealers hang out round there.}
{640}{}{Wh -? "Poisoned?" What in hell's name are you talking about?}
{641}{}{I inspected your son's body. Jet didn't kill him... his body still had traces of radscorpion venom in it.}
{642}{}{I found this Jet canister that Richard used... er, was used on Richard. There were traces of radscorpion venom
 in the cartridge.}
{643}{}{I found a Jet canister that Richard used... er, was used on Richard. There were traces of radscorpion venom
 in the cartridge.}
{644}{}{He was poisoned with radscorpion venom. The Jet overdose was just a cover for the poisoning.}
{650}{}{"Inspected my son's body?"}
{651}{}{Yeah, I had to open his grave to do an autopsy.}
{652}{}{Uh... you know, I DIDN'T. I misspoke. "Son's body?" I meant "somebody's." Yes, that's what I meant.}
{653}{}{This might not be the best time to discuss this. I'll talk to you later.}
{660}{}{You ghoulish son of a bitch...}
{661}{}{You ghoulish bitch...}
{662}{}{ you just earned YOURSELF a plot o' land on Golgotha. IF they find all the pieces. (Starts shouting.) Boys! Get in here!
 And bring yer knives!}
{663}{}{Hold on! Can't we talk about this?}
{664}{}{You're going to need more than knives to take me down...}
{665}{}{Excuse me. The exit and I have an appointment.}
{670}{}{Assuming I believe this for a second... and I ain't saying I AM... then who POISONED my son? And why did they go to the
 trouble of dosin' him with Jet?}
{671}{}{Word is it was the Salvatores. They pumped him with Jet laced with radscorpion venom, then left him for you to find.}
{672}{}{I don't know which of the Salvatores did it. Renesco doctored up some Jet for them, not knowing they'd use it to
 poison your son.}
{673}{}{I don't know.}
{680}{}{Now why in hell would they do that?}
{681}{}{Way I see it, the Mordinos control the Jet in Reno. Naturally, you'd blame them for a drug overdose... and then there'd
 be war. IF you two didn't wipe each other out, you'd at least be weakened by the fight. That makes life easier for the
 Salvatores... all they have to worry about then is the Bishops.}
{682}{}{I don't know. Maybe you should ask them.}
{690}{}{(Stares at you for a long time, then a dry chuckle escapes his lips.) You give me an answer, and I can't do nothing about
 it. The Salvatores... goddammit. (Takes a deep breath.)}
{691}{}{What's wrong?}
{692}{}{"You can't do anything about it?" What do you mean?}
{700}{}{Know what those Salvatore bastards are ARMED with, friend? Those damned lightbringers. ONE Salvatore packing that kind
 of heat can kill my whole family without batting an eye. To beat that, I'd need...}
{701}{}{Vad?}
{702}{}{Don't worry about it, I've kicked the shins out from underneath the Salvatores already.}
{710}{}{Ha! The ones in Reno maybe, but you got a lot to learn about the families... there's still Salvatores kicking
 around beyond Reno, and even if there's just one left, that's trouble. To beat them, I'd need...}
{720}{}{(Frown deepens.) This smells like a pile of brahmin shit to me...}
{721}{}{Don't believe me? Look, I inspected your son's body, and it REEKED of radscorpion venom.}
{722}{}{Look, trust me... your son was POISONED. I don't know by who, but somebody went to great pains to make it look like a
 Jet overdose.}
{750}{}{You have solved the murder.}
{775}{}{You fingered a suspect in Richard Wright's death.}
{800}{}{You have correctly identified who killed Richard Wright and the motive.}
{825}{}{You have become a made man of the Wright family.}
{5243}{}{!}
{5249}{}{. I'm interested in a job.}
{5261}{}{!}
{5310}{}{." Glad you stopped by, damn neighborly of you. (Sneer crumbles into a frown.) Looking for work in family Wright, huh?}
{5467}{}{ crack base. }
{5580}{}{. Go to the Cat's Paw and New Reno Arms... tell them you're from me, and they'll set you up. You're family now... a made
 man, and all Reno's gonna know it.}
{5590}{}{...everyone treating you all right? No problems?}
{6467}{}{ smash!}
