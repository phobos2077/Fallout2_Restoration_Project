{100}{}{You see Jack, the Abbey's medic.}
{101}{}{He has a red cross on his shoulder.}
{200}{}{If you are injured, talk to me.}
{300}{}{How can I help you?}
{301}{}{I'm injured, can you help me?}
{302}{}{[Dräggel.]}
{303}{}{So, what do you do here at the Abbey?}
{304}{}{Hej då.}
{400}{}{It is done!}
{401}{}{Tack.}
{402}{}{Stop that!}
{403}{}{[GO ON]}
{404}{}{[LÄMNA]}
{405}{}{STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!}
{406}{}{[GO ON]}
{407}{}{[SLUTA]}
{408}{}{(Suddenly, Jack starts to melt.) I'M MELTING, I'M MELTING, OH WHAT A WORLD...}
{409}{}{What the fu...}
{500}{}{Hey, don't steal my medical supplies!}
{501}{}{You gain 200 experience points for making Jack melt. Are you happy now, you sick fuck?}
{600}{}{I'm a doctor. I've been tending to the people of this Abbey for about, oh, fifteen years now, I believe.}
{601}{}{I see. That's a lot of years to study all the pre-war medical books in the Abbey's library. You must be quite the doctor.}
{602}{}{Where did you get all your medical equipment?}
{603}{}{Interesting. I think I will be leaving now.}
{604}{}{[He frowns.] I fancy myself a fine doctor, but I can't credit the books for that since I'm not even allowed to... never mind, I won't get into that. My father was a doctor, and he passed his knowledge down to me.}
{605}{}{Ah, I see.}
{700}{}{Some of these meds I received from my father. Most of the rest were already here at the Abbey.}
{701}{}{Interesting, bye.}
{702}{}{Do you think you could give me some of your meds? You seem to have plenty to spare.}
{703}{}{You want me to just *give* them to you? What makes you think you deserve them more than the people of the Abbey?}
{704}{}{Because I tend to get hurt... a lot.}
{705}{}{Because I'm on a holy quest to find a Garden Of Eden Creation Kit. You see, my entire village will perish if
 I don't find this device in time. Your people, on the other hand, seem to live a peaceful life without much need for so
 much healing equipment. I'm not asking for a lot, even the smallest amount you could give me would help me greatly.}
{706}{}{[He ponders over your words for a moment, then nods.] Alright, I'll give you some of our excess medical supplies.
 It sounds like you're gonna need 'em. Here. [He hands them to you.] Good luck, wanderer.}
{707}{}{Thanks, Jack. You're a true savior of the wastes. Bye.}
{708}{}{Then perhaps you should learn to be more careful. Sorry, I'm not going to just give away the Abbey's medical supplies.}
{709}{}{Fine. GOODBYE.}
{800}{}{I can't talk right now.}
{801}{}{Sorry, I'm in the middle of something now. Come see me later.}
{802}{}{Hello again.}
