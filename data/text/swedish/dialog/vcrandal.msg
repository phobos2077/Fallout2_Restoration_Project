{100}{}{You see Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer.}
{101}{}{You see a middle-aged man with thinning black hair.}
{102}{}{You see Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer.}
{103}{}{You see a middle-aged man with thinning black hair.}
{104}{}{Congratulations, }
{105}{}{Way to put those Enclave assh-... er, jerks, in their place!}
{106}{}{I heard you kicked some major tail down south. Way to go.}
{107}{}{An intruder! Guards! Guards!}
{108}{}{Wh-?! A mutant! Guards!}
{109}{}{Wh-? A ghoul! Guards!}
{110}{}{Good day, Captain.}
{111}{}{Vault City prevails, Captain.}
{112}{}{Good day, Citizen.}
{113}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{114}{}{Need to send distribution charts to Sub-Amenities Offices A and B...}
{115}{}{Need to compile the latest stock inventories and put them on the list server...}
{116}{}{I miss DOS. This new operating system makes it harder to enter lists.}
{117}{}{The First Citizen still needs those inventory lists...}
{118}{}{Sorry, we're closed for the evening. Come back in the morning.}
{119}{}{We're closed. I'm just compiling these lists before I head home.}
{120}{}{Hello there, stranger. Always a pleasure to see a new face. Name's Randal... I'm the Chief Amenities Officer. Need something?}
{121}{}{Gechkk}
{122}{}{Nooooooooo-pe}
{123}{}{Shamble off}
{124}{}{Well, it depends. What is this place?}
{125}{}{Nothing today, actually.}
{126}{}{A GECK? That's a Garden of Eden Creation Kit, a kind of gray suitcase looking thing, right? I haven't heard anyone mention one of those in... well, since... almost forever.}
{127}{}{NEED Gechkkk}
{128}{}{Shamble off}
{129}{}{Do you have one?}
{130}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{131}{}{Well, never mind then.}
{132}{}{Hate to break it to you, friend, but we don't have ours anymore. Used it up to make Vault City...*poof.* All gone.}
{133}{}{NEED Gechkkk.}
{134}{}{Shamble off}
{135}{}{Oh... well, do you know of any place that might have one?}
{136}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{137}{}{Well, nevermind then.}
{138}{}{Well, hmmm. Here's your problem, as I see it: the GECK's an old piece of tech... pre-war tech, in fact. You just can't "find" them anymore. They were only issued to Vaults.}
{139}{}{NEED Valt.}
{140}{}{Shamble off}
{141}{}{Do you know where I could find any other Vaults?}
{142}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{143}{}{Well, never mind then.}
{144}{}{You could go scan the Vault Central Computer, see if it has any coordinates for any other Vaults. I doubt it, but no harm in checking.}
{145}{}{Well, if you had access to our Vault Central Computer, you might be able to find some mention of some other Vaults. But only Citizens are allowed in the Vault.}
{146}{}{Tanks}
{147}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{148}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{149}{}{Hey there, welcome back. Anything I can do for you?}
{150}{}{Sure. What's on your mind?}
{151}{}{Gechkk?}
{152}{}{Shamble off}
{153}{}{What is this place again?}
{154}{}{Do you happen to have a GECK in stock?}
{155}{}{Valerie over at the maintenance shed could use a new wrench and some pliers.}
{156}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a... uh, hydro-magneto-thingie that I could have for the Gecko power plant.}
{157}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator in stock that I could have.}
{158}{}{The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.}
{159}{}{Nothing today, actually.}
{160}{}{This is the Amenities Office. Got your typical stock... basic living necessities, some books, "how to" manuals, some tools, stimpacks, medical supplies, this and that.}
{161}{}{Sounds great. Can I see what you have in stock?}
{162}{}{Do you have a GECK?}
{163}{}{Valerie over at the maintenance shed could use a new wrench and some pliers.}
{164}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a... uh, hydro-magneto-thingie that I could have for the Gecko power plant.}
{165}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator in stock that I could have.}
{166}{}{The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.}
{167}{}{Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{168}{}{I may be back some other time.}
{169}{}{Well, sorry to break it to you, but I'm only authorized to do transactions with Citizens. No offense to you, but it's the rule, you know? You might try Happy Harry's out in the Courtyard.}
{170}{}{Well, sorry to break it to you, but I'm only authorized to do transactions with Citizens. No offense to you, but it's the rule, you know? You might try Happy Harry's out in the Courtyard.}
{171}{}{How can I become a Citizen?}
{172}{}{But... uh, I am a Citizen. Don't you remember me?}
{173}{}{Look, my money's just as good as any Citizen's.}
{174}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator in stock that I could have.}
{175}{}{The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.}
{176}{}{Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{177}{}{Fine. Goodbye.}
{178}{}{You can take the Citizenship test. Proconsul Gregory gives it to any Outsider who wants to become a Citizen. You should probably talk to First Citizen Lynette first, though. She kind of runs the show around here.}
{179}{}{All right. Where is she?}
{180}{}{I see. Mind if I ask you another question?}
{181}{}{Thanks for the information. I'll go look for her.}
{182}{}{She's in the Council Building... head out the building here, make a right, and keep heading down the street past the park. You should run right smack into it.}
{183}{}{I see. Mind if I ask you another question?}
{184}{}{Thanks for the information. I'll go look for her.}
{185}{}{Really? Can't say I recall you. You got any papers on you? Might clear up the matter.}
{186}{}{No, I don't have them on me right now.}
{187}{}{Yes. Here you go.}
{188}{}{Never mind. I'll talk to you later.}
{189}{}{Well, let me run it through the reader here, and we'll just make sure everything's on the up and up. Won't take but a moment.}
{190}{}{Wh-?! Whoa! Give those papers back!}
{191}{}{Uh... actually, I don't have time to buy anything right now. Let me have the papers back, and I'll be on my way.}
{192}{}{All right. I'm sure everything's in order.}
{193}{}{Well... uh, all right.}
{194}{}{Mind if I ask you some questions?}
{195}{}{I'll see you later.}
{196}{}{Everything checks out. Here's your papers back. What can I do for you?}
{197}{}{Let me see what you have in stock.}
{198}{}{Actually, do you mind if I ask you some questions instead?}
{199}{}{Nothing today, actually.}
{200}{}{So... you're Citizen }
{201}{}{Yeah, he said you'd be stopping by... }
{202}{}{All right.}
{203}{}{Actually, never mind, I'll come back later for it.}
{204}{}{Okay, here you go. One Hy-Mag. Kinda looks like a lava lamp, doesn't it? Oh, don't drop it... it's pretty fragile.}
{205}{}{Say, what else do you have in stock?}
{206}{}{Mind if I ask you some questions?}
{207}{}{Thanks. I might stare at this for a few hours before taking it to the Gecko plant.}
{208}{}{Got it. Thanks for the part.}
{209}{}{Yeah, the First Citizen said you'd be stopping by... Captain. (Winks.) Let me tell you, Captain, you've got a BEAUTY waiting for you.}
{210}{}{Yeah, the First Citizen said you'd be stopping by. Well, let me tell you, friend, you got a BEAUTY waiting for you.}
{211}{}{What is it?}
{212}{}{Actually, keep it for me. I'll pick it up later.}
{213}{}{Nothing less than a Heckler and Koch G11, one of the best assault weapons ever made...(hefts weapon, passes it to you)...fires a 4.7 mm caseless cartridge, 50-round magazine. When it talks, people listen.}
{214}{}{I'll bet. Thanks.}
{215}{}{No problem. Plus, here... have a couple of frag grenades on me. Consider it my thanks for wiping out those raiders.}
{216}{}{Great. Can I see what else you have in stock?}
{217}{}{Can I ask you some other questions?}
{218}{}{Thanks. I'll put them to good use.}
{219}{}{That'll do it for you, then?}
{220}{}{Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{221}{}{Yeah, that'll be it for today.}
{222}{}{Yeah, I know. I'm still waiting for the requisition lists to clear the server, but it's going to be a while. Don't know what to say. Things just take time.}
{223}{}{I see. Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{224}{}{Maybe I can go find those tools somewhere else, then.}
{225}{}{!}
{226}{}{, huh? Wait one minute, and I'll go get you the Hydroelectric Magneto... uh, the Hy-Mag.}
{227}{}{, right? Wait one minute, and I'll go get you the Hydroelectric Magneto... uh, the Hy-Mag.}
{228}{}{Tack.}
