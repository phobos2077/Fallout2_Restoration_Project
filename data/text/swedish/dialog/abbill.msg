{100}{}{Du ser handlare Bill.}
{101}{}{Du ser en äldre köpman.}
{200}{}{Hallå där, resenär. Jag heter Bill. Vad kan jag ta fram åt dig?}
{201}{}{Välkommen tillbaka. Behöver du något annat?}
{202}{}{Låt oss förhandla.}
{203}{}{Jag har hört att du är mannen man ska prata med om karavaner.}
{204}{}{Det är inte viktigt. Hej då.}
{210}{}{Säg, jag har märkt att en hel del gammal utrustning och föremål har samlats in här i Klostret.
 Jag antar att du inte har hittat något speciellt under din tid här?}
{211}{}{Heh, so you noticed that, huh? Yeah, the Abbey folks have a bit of a fascination with anything pre-war,
 especially if it's tech related. They've formed some kind of kooky religion around it. I don't quite understand it,
 myself, but they're nice people and they pay good money for anything pre-war I manage to get my hands on. But anyway,
 as for something special... hmm, [He glances over at Marcus.] It's funny you should ask, I just might have something that
 would interest your friend here.}

 useful right now.}
{213}{}{Oh, well. Let's see what you have in stock instead.}
{214}{}{That's alright. Let me ask you something else.}
{215}{}{Such as?}
{216}{}{You see, a caravan came through here not too long ago, claiming to have come up from the deep south. Said they'd
 been attacked by some of them vile mutants (turning to Marcus) no offense, big guy. Anyway, they did a lot of bragging
 about how they'd wasted all the muties. Claimed there'd been nearly a dozen of 'em, and I called bullshit. But it turns
 out they had some proof.}
{217}{}{Yeah? What was that?}
{218}{}{A hulking set of mutant armor they'd managed to salvage off one of the corpses. Of course, for all I know, they
 stole it off the bones of some long dead mutie they'd stumbled upon in the wastes, but who knows? Anyway, they weren't
 eager to keep lugging the heavy thing around, so they offered it to me for dirt cheap. I didn't know what I'd ever do
 with it, but I figured a deals a deal.}
{219}{}{Jag är säker på att Marcus här kan dra nytta av detta. Hur mycket kostar det?}
{220}{}{Det var intressant. Marcus här är tuff nog. Jag tror inte att vi behöver den där. Låt mig fråga dig
något annat.}
{221}{}{Den här rackaren kan lätt smältas ner för att göra tre eller fyra uppsättningar metallrustningar. Låt oss säga 3 000 dollar.}
{222}{}{Jag har råd med det.}
{223}{}{I think I'll pass for right now. Let me ask you something else.}
{224}{}{Alright then. This is going to take two of us to move this thing, so let me help you fit it to your friend here.}
{225}{}{[Färdig]}
{226}{}{Hey, this fits nicely!}
{300}{}{I might know a thing or two. What would you like to know?}
{301}{}{How often do you get resupplied?}
{302}{}{Are the caravans hiring?}
{303}{}{On second thought, I have to go.}
{304}{}{I get a new shipment of supplies twice a month. Frankly, I wish they'd come more often, but we're only on a
 minor trade route so I guess this is the best we can get.}
{305}{}{I'm not quite sure. Usually, the ones that stop by here are pretty well equipped and not really interested in
 hanging around very long. But if you're looking to hook up with one of em, I'd head over to Redding or even down to NCR.
 They've got pretty active caravans and good help is always wanted.}
{306}{}{Interesting. I was curious about something else.}
{307}{}{Thanks. Let's barter.}
{308}{}{Well, thanks for the information. See you around.}
{400}{}{Found everything you need?}
{401}{}{Actually, I'd like to take another look at your goods.}
{402}{}{Yes I did. See you around.}
