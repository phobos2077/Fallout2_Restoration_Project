{100}{}{You see a bar patron looking at you.}
{101}{}{You see a bar patron eating some jerky.}
{102}{}{You see a bar patron drinking a mug of beer.}
{103}{}{You see a bar patron.}
{104}{}{You see a scruffy looking bar patron. Possibly a trapper.}
{105}{}{You see a tough-looking patron. Probably a trapper.}
{106}{}{You see a weathered bar patron. Probably either a trapper or a farmer.}
{107}{}{You see a fit-looking bar goer. They could be a brahmin herder or a farmer.}
{110}{}{You'll fit in just fine here.}
{111}{}{Buy a round of drinks, why dontcha?}
{112}{}{Gonna arm-wrestle the Duntons?}
{113}{}{You look like you came north from the Den.}
{114}{}{Wadda you lookin' at?}
{115}{}{You sure got purty skin, sweetheart. Heh, heh, heh.}
{116}{}{Urp, I could use another mug o' gecko piss.}
{117}{}{If you need cash, the Duntons are lookin' for some help.}
{118}{}{You're not half-bad for a tribal.}
{119}{}{96 mugs of piss on the wall, 96 mugs o' piss...}
{120}{}{I'm gonna go south to the Den; lotsa work there.}
{121}{}{More gecko piss here, Salvadore!}
{122}{}{Trapping's bad lately; must be an easier way to make money.}
{123}{}{I'm not as drink as you thunk I am.}
{124}{}{Hey buddy, do these dice look loaded to you? (rattle, rattle)}
{125}{}{Talk to the Duntons or the barman for work, pal.}
{126}{}{You chose the right place to drink, friend.}
{127}{}{No, Bishop, not the thing with the knife again!}
{128}{}{Anyone up for a game of dice?}
{129}{}{Nice not to have Aldo stinking up the place.}
{130}{}{Ever taken some brahmin what ain't yours?}
{131}{}{Watch out for the Spirit that Walks!}
{132}{}{There's a spirit in a canyon east of here.}
{133}{}{Trapping's dangerous; lost a good trapper few weeks back.}
{134}{}{Just love to trick that Torr.}
{140}{}{Look who's come to visit.}
{141}{}{(mumble, mumble) ...goody two shoes type here... (mumble)}
{142}{}{Aren't you in the wrong part of town?}
{143}{}{Don't need your kind here, tribal.}
{144}{}{Maybe if you buy us all a drink we'll let you stay.}
{145}{}{Push off, tribal.}
{146}{}{What are you looking so hard at?}
{147}{}{The Dunton's will fix you, tribal.}
{148}{}{You sure chose the wrong place for a drink.}
{149}{}{Your momma ain't in here kid; try the Bathhouse.}
{150}{}{Why don't you go play someplace else?}
{151}{}{There's a nice canyon for you, just east of here.}
{152}{}{What do you want?}
{153}{}{Better just mind your own business.}
{154}{}{Your name Torr? (heh, heh, heh)}
{155}{}{Go drink with Aldo, why dontcha?}
{156}{}{This ain't your kinda place, punk.}
{157}{}{You aren't my kind of drinking buddy.}
{158}{}{Humph. (spits on the floor)}
{159}{}{You sure ain't much to look at.}
{160}{}{Feeling unwelcome... yet?}
{162}{}{'Bout time, tribal.}
{163}{}{Tack.}
{164}{}{Nee!}
{165}{}{Ecky, ecky, p'tang!}
{166}{}{I'm going to get pissed.}
{167}{}{Nothing like Gecko Piss.}
{168}{}{Thanks for the Piss.}
{169}{}{Huzzah!}
{170}{}{Tribals know what's best in life.}
{171}{}{Thank-you.}
{172}{}{More Piss for everyone!}
{173}{}{I sure needed that; thanks.}
{174}{}{Thanks a million!}
{175}{}{Rather have a frontal lobotomy...}
{176}{}{Golden Piss!}
{177}{}{Alright!}
{178}{}{Love that piss.}
{179}{}{You're a good Tribal.}
