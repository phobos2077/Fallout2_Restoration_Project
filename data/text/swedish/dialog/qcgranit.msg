{100}{}{You see a trooper wearing Enclave power armor.}
{101}{}{You see Sergeant Granite.}
{102}{}{You see a trooper with sergeant's chevrons on his shoulder.}
{103}{}{Let's get that lunatic.}
{104}{}{Yeah, lemme at 'im!}
{105}{}{Lock and load. Let's go!}
{106}{}{Ready to rock.}
{107}{}{Let's take that freak down!}
{108}{}{Slag 'im.}
{109}{}{I'm good to go.}
{110}{}{Let's rock!}
{111}{}{I'm gonna light that freak up!}
{112}{}{I don't take to killing idjits.}
{113}{}{You can go.}
{114}{}{I didn't see nuthin'.}
{115}{}{These are not the droids we are looking for.}
{116}{}{Move along.}
{117}{}{I'm tired of the killing.}
{118}{}{Go on, get!}
{119}{}{Stand easy, lads.}
{120}{}{Watch yourself out there, mutie.}
{121}{}{Good luck, mutant. You're gonna need it.}
{122}{}{Halt! What are you doing here?}
{123}{}{I'm trying to get back to my people.}
{124}{}{None of your business.}
{125}{}{I don't have time for your questions.}
{126}{}{Just who are you?}
{127}{}{Well, you know that freak, Agent Horrigan, just stormed past here. He's waiting for someone to try and make a break for it.}
{128}{}{Who's that?}
{129}{}{I think you're wrong on that one. Let's just say I'm making it my business. Now, just what the hell are you doing here?}
{130}{}{I'm trying to get back to the boat so I can escape with my tribe.}
{131}{}{Well, you just better make time.}
{132}{}{Why? What do you mean?}
{133}{}{I don't make time. I make corpses and you're next.}
{134}{}{Have it your way, but don't say we didn't try to warn ya.}
{135}{}{Warn me? About what?}
{136}{}{Yeah, I'm warned all right. Time to die, Enclave scum.}
{137}{}{He's some genetically engineered freak is what he is. Used to be the president's bodyguard. Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan. Now he's more than half machine.}
{138}{}{Sounds like bad news.}
{139}{}{I've killed worse than that. He'll just be another stain in a few minutes.}
{140}{}{Gee, you've got me shaking in my boots. Shut up. }
{141}{}{Oh, that he is, and worse. He's going to mop the floor with you. He's tough, fast, and just plain mean. I've seen what he likes to do to mutants and it ain't pretty.}
{142}{}{I'm not a mutant and... uh, what did he do?}
{143}{}{I don't like to talk about it. It gives me nightmares. Let's just say that those walls aren't covered with *rust* exactly.}
{144}{}{Sounds like I'm going to have a hard time getting past him.}
{145}{}{That's the understatement of the year. I pity ya, pal, really do.}
{146}{}{Pity me? You should feel bad for yourself. Your power plant's control computer got fried and now you're headed for a meltdown. You're all dead men unless...}
{147}{}{I don't need your pity. I just need you to die.}
{148}{}{I've got things to do. You're all dead men anyway. Try to enjoy your last few minutes on this earth. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. Goodbye.}
{149}{}{Unless what?!?}
{150}{}{Unless you help me get past Horrigan to get to my ship.}
{151}{}{Never mind. I don't have time to discuss this. Goodbye.}
{152}{}{Oh, yeah. Tell me another one. If the reactor's scragged how come the light's are still on? Huh, smartie? Heh, heh, tell me another one.}
{153}{}{That's just the *emergency* lighting. Hey, I saw where the computer *was.* It's not broken, it's *gone.* I'm telling you, you're all goin' down for the count unless...}
{154}{}{I don't have time to argue about this anymore. Hope you're all strong swimmers. Goodbye.}
{155}{}{Don't you tell a pretty story. You make me laugh. Y'know, I think you might even last over the one-minute mark with Horrigan. That'd be a new record. Good luck, mutie.}
{156}{}{Gee, aren't you generous. I better warm up first. On you and your squad.}
{157}{}{You better hope that armor floats. Goodbye.}
{158}{}{Okay, okay. I can't talk for everyone, but my squad and I will do our best to help you put that freak Horrigan away for good. I don't wanna drown like no rat.}
{159}{}{Good thinking. Let's go get him. We've got to get out of here.}
{160}{}{Sergeant Granite of EC Company.}
{161}{}{EC Company?}
{162}{}{Enclave Control Company. We're responsible for perimeter defense, *usually* that is.}
{163}{}{Oh, I see. What do you mean *usually?*}
