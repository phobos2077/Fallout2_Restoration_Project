{150}{}{You see Rebecca, the owner of Becky's Casino Bar.}
{200}{}{Hi there, I'm Rebecca. Can I get you something to drink? I'm sure you're thirsty
 after your trip through the wastes.}
{201}{}{Hey! You want a drink or did you just come back to say hi?}
{202}{}{Hi! Glad you came back. Any questions or are you here for some fine whiskey?}
{203}{}{Really glad to see you. What's up? Need something?}
{204}{}{Hope everything's going well for my favorite customer! What can we do for you today?}

{208}{}{Hi there!}
{209}{}{It's you! I thought so. How about a drink, my honey?}
{210}{}{You back for some of Rebecca's great entertainment or the world famous whiskey?}
{211}{}{Welcome back to Rebecca's Bar and Casino. How can I help you?}
{212}{}{Hello. How can we help you?}
{213}{}{Something for you today? How about a drink?}
{214}{}{Would you care for a drink today, or perhaps something else?}
{215}{}{How can I be of service?}
{216}{}{Greetings. What can we get you?}
{217}{}{Need something?}
{218}{}{Nice to see you again. How can I help you today?}
{219}{}{Vad?}
{220}{}{Ja?}
{221}{}{Now what?}
{222}{}{Please keep it short. It's a busy day. What do you need?}
{223}{}{What can I do for you? I'm really busy.}
{224}{}{You here for a drink? The tables are over there.}
{225}{}{I'm really not in the mood. What now?}
{226}{}{You're back already? I guess you want a drink then?}
{240}{}{Sure, handsome.}
{241}{}{What would you like to know?}
{242}{}{I'd be happy to.}
{243}{}{But of course.}
{244}{}{Visst.}
{245}{}{I don't mind.}
{246}{}{I'll help if I can.}
{247}{}{Of course, don't be silly.}
{248}{}{Anything. Now what was it?}
{249}{}{I'll do my best to help you out. What did you need to know?}
{250}{}{Ask away.}
{251}{}{If you insist.}
{252}{}{I guess so.}
{253}{}{Let's keep it short. I have a business to run.}
{254}{}{Well, okay. What is it?}
{255}{}{I suppose.}
{256}{}{Vad?}
{257}{}{No, sorry.}
{258}{}{Inte just nu}
{270}{}{I need a drink.}
{271}{}{I'm looking for a merchant who sells Vault equipment.}
{272}{}{I'm looking for a merchant named Vic.}
{273}{}{Do you have any work?}
{274}{}{About that job...}
{275}{}{Any more work for me?}
{276}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{277}{}{Wekee.}
{278}{}{Ruh ruh?}
{279}{}{Iho shasha.}
{280}{}{dy.}
{281}{}{Ruh ruh?}
{300}{}{Whiskey is my specialty. It's almost a tradition in the Dyer family. I charge the
 low, low price of only $5.}
{301}{}{Drinks are still $5, and the Dyer family makes the best darn drinks in the whole world.}
{302}{}{You okay? You want whiskey? Only $5.}
{303}{}{I'll take a drink.}
{304}{}{Why are your drinks so cheap?}
{305}{}{Färgare?}
{306}{}{Can I ask a question?}
{307}{}{Hej då.}
{308}{}{Wekee}
{309}{}{Urka.}
{320}{}{Oh, that's the family name. The name Dyer has been in the bar business for a
 long time - prewar times, of course.}
{321}{}{As I said, it's my family name. There used to be Dyer pubs, saloons or something,
 all over the world.}
{322}{}{I'll take a drink.}
{323}{}{Can I ask another question?}
{324}{}{Hej då.}
{330}{}{Well, since you're such a good customer, I'll let you in on a little secret.
 It's simple really - I have a still. A friend from a nearby town taught me how to
 make one. So, would you like another one?}
{331}{}{Sorry, it's a trade secret. Plus, I don't really know you that well. I wouldn't
 want Frankie finding out. He's enough trouble as it is. Did you still want one? They
 really hit the spot.}
{332}{}{Sure. I'll have one.}
{333}{}{Can I ask another question?}
{334}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{340}{}{There you are. Thank you very much.}
{341}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a question?}
{342}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{343}{}{Thankey youey.}
{344}{}{Asky?}
{350}{}{Sorry. I don't think so.}
{351}{}{Fred owes me $200. If you can collect it somehow, we'll work something out.}
{352}{}{I still have that debt I need collected.}
{353}{}{Derek borrowed a book of mine a while back. I'll pay $80 if you can get it
 back for me.}
{354}{}{I'm still looking for that book of mine.}
{355}{}{What's the catch?}
{356}{}{Tell me more.}
{357}{}{Can I ask you a question?}
{358}{}{Hej då.}
{370}{}{Catch? Oh, well, if you knew Fred you'd understand. He's owed me the money
 for quite a long time. I'd written it off as a loss, but if you can get it back, I'd be
 amazed... and grateful. He's somewhere in town, I'm sure.}
{371}{}{The book was The Lavender Flower. Derek should be over around Mom's on the east side.}
{372}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{373}{}{Sure sounds easy.}
{374}{}{I already found it.}
{375}{}{I'll have to get back to you.}
{385}{}{You didn't really get it did you? I'd be amazed.}
{386}{}{Oh, did you find my book? Derek better not have messed it up.}
{387}{}{Yes, I did.}
{388}{}{I'm sorry. He's dead.}
{389}{}{Sorry, but Derek's also dead.}
{390}{}{I'm sorry, but he's dead.}
{391}{}{Yes. Here it is.}
{392}{}{No, sorry.}
{400}{}{I can't believe it. How did you do it? Oh, never mind. I'm just stunned,
 that's all. To show my appreciation, I'll split it with you, right down the
 middle. Thank you again, that was very honest of you.}
{401}{}{Oh, I'm so glad you were able to find it... Thank you very much. Here's your money.}
{402}{}{You're welcome.}
{410}{}{I can't believe they are both dead. I'm sorry. Thank you for finding out for
 me. If you'll excuse me...}
{411}{}{I can't believe he's dead... after all these years.}
{412}{}{Visst.}
{413}{}{...}
{420}{}{Yeah, I know who that is. That's Vic - the guy Metzger has locked up.}
{421}{}{Yeah, I know Vic. Metzger's got him locked up. I'm not sure why though.}
{422}{}{Who's Metzger?}
{423}{}{I have another question.}
{424}{}{Great! Bye.}
{430}{}{You came to the Den and you don't know who Metzger is? He's the slave master.
 He's on the east side of town. Hard to miss.}
{431}{}{I have another question.}
{432}{}{Tack.}
{440}{}{Mördare!}
{441}{}{Barnamördare!}
{442}{}{Please leave.}
{443}{}{I won't deal with the likes of you.}
{444}{}{I'm not going down without a fight!}
{450}{}{Buffy! It's you! How are you? It's been a long time!}
{451}{}{Vadå?}
{452}{}{Vadå?}
{460}{}{Dave sends his best and wishes he could be here to say hi, but he had to run off.}
{461}{}{Where to?}
{470}{}{Something about a commando... or that he was going after a commando. Not sure
 exactly. Something like that.}
{471}{}{Åh.}
{480}{}{Oh, he said to give you this. It's a present from the Hendee family. It should
 help you out some.}
{481}{}{What is it?}
{490}{}{Oh, just a few trinkets. Here you go. [Becky hands you $1000, 5 Stimpaks,
 Metal Armor, an Uzi, 5 clips of ammo, a Plasma Grenade, and a flower]}
{491}{}{Tack!}
{500}{}{No problem. I was just holding them for you. Well, I better get back to work.}
{501}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{510}{}{Didn't you hear! He's dead! Oh, I know I shouldn't be happy, but he was a very
 evil man.}
{511}{}{He sure put up a good fight.}
{512}{}{I have a question.}
{513}{}{Yes, he was. Goodbye.}
{514}{}{ döda!}
{520}{}{What? You? I... don't know what to say. He was such an evil man...}
{521}{}{A thank you would be enough.}
{522}{}{Humph.}
{530}{}{Oh, a thank you would be enough. I know this isn't right but... here, take this
 money. [Becky gives you 1000 dollars]}
{531}{}{Keep your money, Rebecca.}
{532}{}{Thank you very much.}
{533}{}{Tank!}
{534}{}{Ug! Perdy lady.}
{540}{}{You are a wonderful man. Even though I don't condone your actions. You did the
 world a great service.}
{541}{}{You are a wonderful woman. Even though I don't condone your actions. You did the
 world a great service.}
{542}{}{Tack.}
{550}{}{You are not welcome here. Please leave.}
{551}{}{Please leave.}
{560}{}{Why did you destroy my still? What did I ever do to you?}
{561}{}{I was paid to do it.}
{562}{}{I don't have to answer to anyone.}
{563}{}{I don't know what you're talking about.}
{564}{}{Hur som helst.}
{565}{}{Ooba gooba.}
{570}{}{Oh really? That sleaze Frankie put you up to it, I'm sure of it. I'll just
 make another one, you know.}
{571}{}{Doesn't matter. I got paid.}
{572}{}{Så.}
{573}{}{I wouldn't be surprised.}
{580}{}{So, you're a coward too? Figures.}
{581}{}{...}
