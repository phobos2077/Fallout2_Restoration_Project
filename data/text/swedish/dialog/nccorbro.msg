{150}{}{You see a well-dressed man who smells like Vaseline. For some reason, he strikes you as faintly reptilian.}

{221}{}{You're a star. A SHOOTING star.}
{222}{}{You're a star. A SPURTING star.}
{223}{}{You're a star. A THROBBING star.}
{224}{}{You deliver a performance worth a thousand hard-ons.}
{225}{}{}
{226}{}{You're a star. A shining star.}
{227}{}{Hey, welcome back!}

{282}{}{That robot o' yours interested in film?}
{290}{}{Look, take your mutant friend outta here. We don't do those kind of movies here.}
{291}{}{Frankly, I don't think any of our actresses could handle your mutant friend.}
{292}{}{We already did one mutant picture - mutant ate all the actresses. And I mean that in the conventional sense.}
{300}{}{Keee-rist! Get that ghoul stinkard outta here before the smell latches on.}
{301}{}{We ain't interested in ghoul pictures. Get him outta here.}
{302}{}{*Phewww* That ghoul stinks ta high heaven! Get an air freshner in here before I pass out.}

{641}{}{Do as the man says, Davin-honey. Do }
{642}{}{Do as he says, Miria my sweet. NOW.}
{650}{}{This place? C'mon, what, you jokin' with me? This here's the Golden Globes, a FILM studio, the only one in Reno, probably
 the ONLY one still erect and standing. What, you don't know your own home? That hurts!}
{651}{}{This place? This here's the Golden Globes, a FILM studio, pal, the only one in Reno, probably the ONLY one still
 erect and standing, see? Now, you gonna talk my ears off, or you wanna job?}
{652}{}{This place? This here's the Golden Globes, a FILM studio, honey, the only one in Reno, probably the ONLY one still

{655}{}{How do you "film?" I mean, c'mon... you'd need cameras, film, projectors... where would you get all that stuff?}
{657}{}{No thanks. I have to be going.}
{658}{}{Just checking. I've been feeling a little drained, lately.}
{670}{}{We lucked out... we don't NEED any of that stoneage crap. We stumbled across a WORKING porno... er, holo... graphic projector.
 No bulky equipment, no fuss... and no unsightly mess.}
{671}{}{Reeeeally... what specs does the projector have?}
{672}{}{I see... well, look: I'm interested in a job, if you're still offering.}
{673}{}{Nice talking to you, but I have to be going.}
{680}{}{Well... we ain't hit capacity on the QEWB drive yet - near as I can tell, it's about a 300 GB high density memory cube.
 Even though the Winblows 57 O.S. eats up 70-75% of that, we could film for a hundred years on that cube.}
{681}{}{Where is this cube now? Can I see it?}
{683}{}{Wow. That's a LOT of porn. I think I'm going to go think about that for a while.}
{690}{}{No, we try and keep everybody outta the film room... everybody wants to throw in their two cents when it comes to
 editing and storage. 'Sides, the cube's gold to us - wouldn't want anything to happen to it.}
{692}{}{Makes sense. God knows what use some thief could put that cube to if they got their hands on it. Oh, well. Bye!}
{700}{}{X-cellent! A-course, I'll need ta see what yer made of, a little try-out to see how you get over the 'hump.' You game, pal?}

{703}{}{Uh, no thanks. I've changed my mind. Some other time.}
{710}{}{Then get the hell outta here, you little shit! We don't need you! Get lost! You'll never work in porn again!}
{711}{}{Me no want to anyway! SO THERE!}
{712}{}{Screw you! You're not my boss. You're not the boss of me. I'm the fucking boss of }

{896}{}{Yup}
{897}{}{Nup}
{899}{}{Uh, I didn't blow every member of the Enclave. You see, what happened was --}
{900}{}{I better go.}
