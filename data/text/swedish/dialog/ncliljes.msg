{341}{}{You got the cojones of a Mordino.}
{342}{}{Last fight was something out of an epic, hombre.}
{343}{}{Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Thaz you, right there, }
{344}{}{Y'know, the Mordinos could use some muscle like you, }
{345}{}{Bet on you, best money I ever placed. You were throwing hooks like nobody's business.}
{346}{}{Saw you fight in the ring, }
{347}{}{How much you bench, }
{348}{}{Where you work out, eh?}
{349}{}{Watch out for the Masticator. He likes to eat ears.}

{371}{}{What, you want me to strip search you and all? C'mon, shoulder that iron 'fore I have to get rough.}
{390}{}{No way you're sneaking by Lil' Jesus with a bod like that, chica.}
{400}{}{Your film wasn't bad, but you obviously need a few pointers from me. ::Laughs::}

{412}{}{Chica, there ain't nothing I wouldn't do for you... c'mon, now. Give me a leetle kiss.}
{425}{}{Don't be showing iron around here, friend. Put that away.}
{435}{}{Don't be sneakin' around, slaver, all right? You're among friends.}

{460}{}{What you sneaking around for, chica? You looking to get shot?}
{465}{}{Get that rolling trash can outta here.}
{466}{}{No bots allowed in here. Beat it.}
{467}{}{That robot's gonna be scrap if it stays.}
{475}{}{I THOUGHT I smelled mutant. Get him outta here 'fore we get mad.}
{476}{}{You a mutant lover? His place is OUTSIDE. Or else.}
{477}{}{That mutant sticks around, he's gonna become target practice.}
{485}{}{I THOUGHT I smelled something rotting. Get that ghoul boy o' yours outta here.}
{486}{}{Get that stinky ghoul outta here. Now.}
{487}{}{That ghoul ain't outta here in a minute, he's gonna be deader than he already is.}
{495}{}{Hey, you. C'mon over here and let me see that knife.}
{496}{}{Nice knife.}
{497}{}{Can I see that knife for a second?}
{505}{}{Hunh? }
{506}{}{Something you want, amigo?}
{507}{}{Something you want, chica?}

{540}{}{}
{541}{}{}
{542}{}{Hey, hey, hey! You're }
{544}{}{Fire it up fire it up}
{547}{}{Thanks, Lil' Jesus. Hey, I had some questions for you...}
{548}{}{Thanks for the compliment. I was just stopping by; I have to be going.}
{549}{}{Yeah, I don't need you to tell me that. Just watch yourself.}
{560}{}{Heeeey! How's it going, }
{562}{}{You being helped, or do I got to call over one of the putas ta get you set up? Ha!}
{563}{}{You being helped, or do I got to call over one of the waitresses ta get you set up? Ha!}
{567}{}{No, I'm fine. Say, I had some questions for you, Jesus...}
{568}{}{No, I'm good, thanks. Catch you later.}
{582}{}{Eh? You looking to deal, slaver? Got some stock you wanna unload?}
{583}{}{Me unload! Me unload!}
{586}{}{Sure. Are you the one to talk to?}
{587}{}{Not right now. I had some questions for you, though...}
{588}{}{Not right now. Maybe later.}
{600}{}{Heh. You been out squatting in the sun too long. Get.}
{601}{}{Eh... right. You take care, amigo. I'll catch you later.}
{602}{}{Eh... right. You take care, chica. I'll catch you later.}
{603}{}{Heh. Maybe you oughta go back out and squat in the sun, tribal. Clear the air in here.}
{604}{}{Okeee Doh-kee}
{620}{}{Get outta here.}
{621}{}{Come around here again, and I'll fill you so full o' lead even Superman couldn't see through you.}
{622}{}{::Plays with knife threateningly::}
{623}{}{::Spits at your feet::}
{624}{}{You look like someone who don't know when they're about to die.}
{625}{}{Beat it 'fore I waste you.}
{626}{}{Come around here again, and I'll gut you.}
{640}{}{(Picks fingernails with knife.) Questions... EVERYBODY got questions...}
{641}{}{(Picks his teeth with a dirty fingernail.) Yeah?}
{642}{}{Something on your mind?}
{643}{}{What was that you were saying about the Mordino Family again?}
{644}{}{I'm looking for a job.}
{645}{}{What is there to do around New Reno to relax?}
{646}{}{You know anything about Richard Wright overdosing on Jet?}
{647}{}{Can you teach me knife fighting?}
{648}{}{Nevermind. Catch you later.}
{660}{}{Me? If you gotta ask... heh. Name's Jesus. Jesus Mordino. Same as my Dad, he's the BIG Jesus, head of the WHOLE Mordino family
 here in Reno. So most call me Lil' Jesus. Prevents confusion, y'know?}
{661}{}{Family Mordino? Who are they?}
{662}{}{I've heard about your family. I hear you guys are a force to be reckoned with.}
{663}{}{I'm looking for a job. Is Family Mordino hiring?}
{665}{}{Know what there is to do around New Reno to relax?}
{666}{}{I see. Say, I had some questions...}
{680}{}{We Mordinos are gonna run New Reno... and Redding, too. You'll see.}
{681}{}{Family MORDINO? You been taking too much Jet, homes? We Mordinos run New Reno... and Redding, too.}
{682}{}{Family MORDINO? You been taking too much Jet, chica? We Mordinos run New Reno... and Redding, too.}
{683}{}{Sounds like the Mordino family is the one to hook up with... can you set me up?}
{684}{}{What do you mean about Redding?}
{685}{}{Redding? Where's that?}
{686}{}{Sounds like the Mordinos have a bright future. Say, I had some questions...}
{687}{}{You Mordinos talk big, but got small cojones. What you got to say about that, LITTLE Jesus?}
{700}{}{To the northwest, homes. }
{701}{}{To the northwest, chica. }
{702}{}{If you ain't been there, you ain't missing nothing. Bunch of no-neck miners who like to FLY, know what I'm saying?}
{703}{}{Not really. What do you mean?}
{704}{}{They're a bunch of drug addicts?}
{705}{}{I hear you. I had some other questions...}
{706}{}{I have to go. Later, Jesus.}
{720}{}{Bunch of no-neck miners, dig in the dirt, but they like to FLY, know what I'm saying?}
{740}{}{Them no-necks dig for gold, see, but what WE give them is better than gold, know what I'm saying? They give us ALL
 the gold they dig up just for a LEETLE Jet. Everybody happy.}
{742}{}{Sounds like it. Look, I had some other questions...}
{760}{}{Well, when they got their first taste o' Jet, they were. You can't have just one.}
{761}{}{Where does the Jet come from?}
{762}{}{I hear you. Look, I had some other questions...}
{780}{}{The Jet? It comes from HERE. See, we don't dig for gold, we MAKE it: liquid gold. Jet. Worth a fortune to the miners, costs
 next to nothing to make. We ship it to Redding, they shoot up, they fly, they ship us gold. That simple.}
{781}{}{How long has this been going on? It seems like you would have controlled all of Northern California by now if Jet was that
 addictive.}
{800}{}{You're right about that... see, we didn't always HAVE Jet. But we stumbled across this kid - he took a look at the shitty
 drugs we was selling and said he could do 'better.' And he did. Now he works for us. That simple.}
{801}{}{Who is this kid and where is he?}
{820}{}{Kid's name's Myron. As for where he IS, that's somethin' you don't need to know.}
{821}{}{Kid's name's Myron. We got him set up in the stables, north of town, testing new drugs. You could go over and see him if
 you want, but he's busy most of the time... either with the drugs or the women.}
{822}{}{Why don't you get smart and tell me anyway?}
{823}{}{Got it. I had some other questions...}
{824}{}{Myron, huh? All right then, Jesus. Thanks for the conversation.}
{840}{}{The Desperado is the place to be, homes. We got the Jet, the games, the action... and we got all the putas you need
 right outside, wet and willing. Paradise, homes. Pair-a-dice.}
{841}{}{The Desperado is the place to be, chica. We got the Jet, the games, and the action. You
 ain't need to go nowhere else.}
{842}{}{So... you wanna re-lax, chica? Heh... then how 'bout you and me get down to some sweet love?}
{843}{}{Tempting, but I haven't got ten seconds for your sweet love right now, Little Jesus.}
{844}{}{I'm flattered, but no thanks. Say, I had some other questions...}
{846}{}{I'm looking for a job. Know of any place that's hiring?}
{847}{}{Thanks for the tip, thanks.}
{848}{}{Why don't you start without me? I have to go.}
{860}{}{Eh? What are you talkin ab --? (Gets it.) You fucking PUTA! You better get yo tramp ass outta here 'fore I carve you
 into so many pieces your own mother won't recognize you.}
{861}{}{Eh? What are you talkin ab --? (Gets it.) You better get your ass out here, homes, 'fore I take my knife and give
 you a second smile on that neck of yours.}
{862}{}{Try it and see what happens, LITTLE Jesus.}
{863}{}{Try it, and I'll add so many scars to your face you'll look like a jigsaw puzzle.}
{864}{}{Calm down... I was just kidding with you.}
{865}{}{Chill. I had some other questions...}
{867}{}{I'm leaving. Great talking to someone as cultured as you.}
{880}{}{Ha! You all right, chica. You all right. Lil' Jesus gonna be keeping an eye on you... not that I couldn't help myself. What
 can I do for you?}
{881}{}{First thing you can do for me is keep your eyes to yourself, LITTLE Jesus. I'd sooner consider humping a rock before
 touching that cratered landscape you call a face.}
{882}{}{I'm looking for a job. Know of anyone who's hiring?}
{883}{}{I had some other questions...}
{884}{}{Actually, I have to be going. Good talking to you, Jesus.}
{890}{}{(Checks you over, nods.) We're always looking for new blood...'specially new blood that's willing to spill blood, know what I'm saying? Go upstairs, talk to my Pa, tell him I sent you, and maybe we can do business.}
{891}{}{(Checks you over, shakes head.) We don't hire chicas...'cept in certain positions. Try Pa upstairs, tell him I sent you.
 Maybe you can do some business.}
{892}{}{Maybe so. Say, I had some other questions...}
{893}{}{I'll go see him then. Later, Jesus.}
{900}{}{I don't know. You don't look too strong to me... maybe you should try somewhere else, homes.}
{901}{}{Naw... my mind's a blank. Our family ain't hiring, and the other families sooner'd kill you than listen to you. You
 outta luck, homes.}
{902}{}{Naw... I don't know of no place hiring. You might try and find a pimp, MAYBE earn some cash charging rent on yer
 ass, y'know?}
{903}{}{WE ain't hiring, but with a bod like that, you might try the Corsican Bros Studio up the street. (Grins.) But if you're looking
 for some quick chips, my room's upstairs...}
{904}{}{All right then. I had some other questions...}
{905}{}{Uh, I'll pass. I had some other questions...}
{906}{}{I'd rather not, thanks. I had some other questions for you, though...}
{907}{}{Oh, I bet it WOULD be quick. No thanks.}
{908}{}{Nevermind then. Thanks anyway.}
{909}{}{No thanks. I better be going.}
{920}{}{Oh, so that makes it all better then, huh? (Spits at your feet.) Get the hell outta here 'fore I carve you.}
{921}{}{Just try it and see what happens... LITTLE Jesus.}
{922}{}{Calm down, Jesus... look, I had a few other questions...}
{923}{}{I'm leaving.}
{924}{}{You spit on my shoe? You fuck! I'm gonna teach you a lesson about respect, mother fucker.}
{930}{}{No, not me... head on upstairs and see my Pa. He's the one you want to talk to.}
{931}{}{And you are...?}
{932}{}{All right then. Before I go, I had some questions...}
{933}{}{Tack.}
{940}{}{FUCK you. Get outta my family's casino 'fore I carve my initials on your dead body.}
{942}{}{Don't you threaten me, Jesus.}
{943}{}{Hold on - I had some other questions...}
{944}{}{Calm down, Jesus. I'm leaving.}
{950}{}{That little piss-ass Wright kid? Ha! You trying to pin that shit on me? You outta luck; I ain't sorry the little
 fucker's dead, but I didn't have NOTHIN' to do with it.}
{951}{}{Oh, yeah? Well, the Mordinos are the biggest suppliers of Jet in New Reno. That makes you the first ones who are
 gonna take the blame.}
{952}{}{I don't believe you. I think you ARE the one responsible. You and the rest of the Mordinos.}
{953}{}{Who do you figure might have done it?}
{954}{}{Okay... look, I had some other questions...}
{955}{}{All right then. Just asking.}
{965}{}{(Eyes narrow.) Look now, I ain't had NOTHING to do with that kid's death. I don't know what you heard, but if I'd killed
 that kid, I woulda carved him up, not made him crash and burn on Jet, see?}
{966}{}{Yeah, so what if we take the blame? Don't mean we DID it. Little shit took too much. I ain't sorry he's dead. And
 if ol' man Wright starts throwing down, we'll bury him right next to his junkie kid.}
{967}{}{You're a real humanitarian, Jesus.}
{968}{}{That's a GREAT attitude, Jesus.}
{969}{}{You know who sold Richard the Jet that killed him?}
{970}{}{Well, that certainly clears matters up for me. I had some other questions...}
{971}{}{Thanks for the information, Jesus. You've been very helpful.}
{980}{}{Yeah, Renesco... the "Rocketman." Sells so much Jet, he could shoot you to the moon. He's on the west side, in Salvatore
 territory. He don't like the Wrights none, and his drugs ain't PURE, know what I'm saying?}
{981}{}{He can't be the only dealer in a town this size.}
{982}{}{West side, huh? I might stop by. I had some other questions, though...}
{983}{}{All right. I'll check it out. Thanks, Jesus.}
{990}{}{No, there's others, but Renesco's the one who done it.}
{991}{}{What makes you say that?}
{992}{}{Who are the other dealers?}
{993}{}{Yeah, you said that already. Look, I had some other questions...}
{994}{}{All right, Jesus. Thanks for the info.}
{1000}{}{CAUSE he's a half-blind cracker with a mean streak a mile wide that sells BAD SHIT, that's fucking why. You go see him,
 you see what he says about the Wright kid, and THEN you'll see I'm right.}
{1001}{}{What other dealers are there?}
{1002}{}{I may do that. Look, I had some other questions...}
{1003}{}{All right then, Jesus. I'll go check this Renesco out.}
{1010}{}{There's Jules, front of town, peddles mostly to newcomers... n' Jagged Jimmy J, up on 2nd street by the gym... can't
 miss that punk-ass cause he cut his face up one night while on Jet... it's so bad his entire face is all scars.}
{1011}{}{I hear you deal drugs, too, Jesus. How come YOUR name wasn't on that list?}
{1012}{}{What makes you think Renesco's responsible?}
{1013}{}{Interesting. I had some other questions...}
{1014}{}{Renesco, Jules and Jagged Jimmy J. Got it. Thanks for the information.}
{1020}{}{CAUSE, mother fucker, I AIN'T a dealer. }
{1021}{}{CAUSE I AIN'T a dealer, BITCH. }
{1022}{}{I may sell Jet sometimes, but I'm Lil' Jesus MORDINO, not some two-bit Jet-pushing punk that's got to addict ten
 customers a day just to make enough to eat. So FUCK you.}
{1023}{}{You better watch your mouth with me, Jesus.}
{1024}{}{Easy, easy, just curious... look, I had some other questions...}
{1025}{}{All right then. Thanks for the information.}
{1030}{}{(Lil' Jesus glances at the knife in your hand, shakes his head.) }
{1031}{}{(The man glances at the knife in your hand, shakes his head.) }
{1032}{}{*Tchhhh.* Don't you know how to HOLD a knife, homes? }
{1033}{}{*Tchhhh.* Don't you know how to HOLD a knife, chica? }
{1034}{}{Here, like this... (Adjusts your grip.) You need some instruction.}
{1035}{}{(Look at knife. Look at ugly man. Look at knife.) You touch }
{1036}{}{Kagagoogoo}
{1038}{}{Really? Can you teach me?}
{1040}{}{Actually, I had some questions for you, Jesus...}
{1041}{}{Maybe some other time, thanks.}
{1050}{}{Hmmmmm...}
{1051}{}{I don't know, homes... I mean, I ain't got a lot of free time and knife fighting's an ART, y'know?}
{1052}{}{I don't know, chica... I mean, I ain't got a lot of free time and knife fighting's an ART, y'know?}
{1053}{}{I don't know, chica... I mean, I MIGHT be willing to make an exception for a woman such as yourself, but I ain't
 got a lot of free time... and knife fighting's an ART, y'know?}
{1054}{}{I'll give you a hundred chips.}
{1055}{}{I'll give you two hundred chips.}
{1056}{}{My lovemaking's an art, too. Wanna swap styles?}
{1058}{}{Actually, I had some questions...}
{1059}{}{Some other time then... when I have enough chips to change your mind.}
{1060}{}{Maybe some other time then, thanks.}
{1070}{}{Hmmmmm. 200 and it's a deal.}
{1071}{}{Naw... I was thinking about something ELSE, y'know? (His eyes drift down your body, licks his chapped lips.)}
{1072}{}{Tell me you mean 200 chips. PLEASE tell me you mean 200 chips.}
{1073}{}{Oh, you were thinking of sex? Well, keep thinking, cause it ain't gonna happen.}
{1074}{}{Uh, okay. Let's do it. Anything for some added knife skill.}
{1075}{}{All right. Here's the money.}
{1076}{}{Nevermind. Uh, who are you, anyway?}
{1077}{}{Forget it. I had some other questions...}
{1079}{}{Maybe some other time, thanks. I REALLY have to be going.}
{1090}{}{Hmmmm... all right, yeah, I'll do it. You look like you might have the cojones for it. Look, now, the first thing you
 gotta do is...}
{1091}{}{Hmmmm... all right, yeah, I'll do it. You look like you might have the cojones for it... no offense. Look, now, the first
 thing you gotta do is...}
{1092}{}{(Smiles, displaying the rotted remains of his teeth.) All right, yeah, I'll do it. You got some time right NOW, chica?
 Then let's get down to business...}
{1093}{}{All right...}
{1643}{}{Who is this Mordino Family you were talking about?}
{2000}{}{Lil' Jesus shows you some vicious knife fighting tricks. You have become more skilled with knives.}
{2001}{}{At the cost of your dignity, you have become more skilled with knives. You also desperately want a shower.}
