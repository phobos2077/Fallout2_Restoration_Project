{100}{}{You see Eldridge.}
{150}{}{You see a heavily armed man covered with grease. He is gazing at his weapon collection on the walls and smiling dreamily.}
{151}{}{You see Eldridge. He is gazing at his weapon collection and smiling dreamily.}
{200}{}{Congratulations, hero! You done good!}
{201}{}{::Fires his gun into the air, starts hooting and hollering:: Th' Enclave's DEAD! DEAD! DEAD! Yeeee-haw!}
{202}{}{::Ding-dong, the Enclave's dead, the Enclave's dead... ::}
{203}{}{Enclave's a good reason for every citizen to have the right ta bear arms.}
{204}{}{Next time, don't you go to th' Enclave without stopping by here first... I'll make sure you have all the firepower
 you NEED.}

{213}{}{Tapdance on my grave and pee on my firstborn! Power Armor! In Reno!}
{214}{}{You selling that Power Armor, friend?!! Hey! Anybody home?!!}
{220}{}{A 9mm's FINE, but a .233's got stopping power...}
{221}{}{What I really want is a Red Ryder BB gun.}
{222}{}{Hope no one gets a hold of a turbo plasma rifle before I do.}
{223}{}{Wonder where the Salvatores get those laser weapons...}
{224}{}{Was dreaming of plasma weapons again last night...}
{225}{}{Better get that new shipment of shotgun shells in for the Wrights...}
{226}{}{Hope the Mordinos got the gold to pay for their order...}
{227}{}{That weapon? Punch a hole right through a metal wall, it can.}
{228}{}{That boy's a genius... would hardly know it to look at him...}
{229}{}{Better take those dogs for a walk soon before they start peeing everywhere.}
{230}{}{Them Unwashed Villagers are stockpiling more weapons... they're a tough bunch.}
{231}{}{I wish somebody would rob me so I could shoot 'em.}
{232}{}{Gonna need to clean the shelves soon...}
{233}{}{Can't wait to go huntin' gangs next week...}
{234}{}{I got SMGs, pistols, dynamite, grenades... and still people come in wanting swords n' crossbows.}
{240}{}{Welcome, hero! Damn nice work you made of the Enclave... saved all our hides, you did, and I thank you for it. Eldridge's
 the name. You in the market for some iron to fill that holster of yours?}

{256}{}{My boss... }
{257}{}{Jules told me to come here if I was looking for weapons.}
{258}{}{Do the Salvatores buy their lightbringers here?}
{259}{}{I brought you that laser pistol I promised.}
{260}{}{Can you upgrade weapons?}
{261}{}{I'll be back to look around then.}
{262}{}{Excellent... can I see you special stock?}

{312}{}{'Bout time that lazy bastard did his job... pardon my French. So what can I do you for, miss?}
{330}{}{No, no... we used to be in the business of doing that, but...(Looks pained.)...well, there's been an
 accident... and we just don't do it no more. Anything else I can do for you?}
{331}{}{All right then. I'm interested in something else...}
{340}{}{Sure as hell can. Whatcha need suped up?}
{341}{}{Can you do anything with any of these pistols I have?}
{342}{}{One of my rifles could use some attachments.}
{343}{}{Can you do anything with this cattleprod here?}
{344}{}{Nevermind. I was interested in something else...}
{345}{}{Actually, nothing today.}
{350}{}{(Spots your magnum.) I can put a speed loader on that magnum there for $}
{351}{}{That Desert Eagle you got... if you want, I can give it an expanded magazine for $}
{352}{}{Put the speed loader on the magnum.}
{353}{}{Expand the magazine in this Desert Eagle here.}
{354}{}{Actually, I had another weapon in mind...}
{355}{}{Nevermind. I wanted something else...}
{356}{}{Actually, none of them. I have to go.}
{357}{}{Too rich for my blood. I'll be back when I have more cash.}
{365}{}{(Studies your rifles, nods.) }
{366}{}{I can put a scope on that hunting rifle for $}
{367}{}{That assault rifle you got there... I can give it an expanded magazine for $}
{368}{}{I've got a low-light scope I can put on that FN FAL you got for $}
{369}{}{All right then... put a scope on the Colt hunting rifle.}

{385}{}{You want that cattleprod juiced up? I can SUPERCHARGE it for $}
{386}{}{Visst.}
{395}{}{(Eldridge takes the item, examines it critically.) Awright... you just hold on for a bit, and I'll see what I can do.
 (He disappears into the back.)}
{396}{}{Okej.}
{400}{}{(You wait...)}
{401}{}{Wait...}
{405}{}{(And wait some more...)}
{406}{}{Dum de dum de dum...}
{410}{}{(You are about to nod off, when suddenly Eldridge returns.) Sorry about the wait... here ya go. This might give you
 an edge against any son of bitches that try n' step on your shadow.}
{411}{}{Thanks. Can you upgrade any of my other weapons?}
{412}{}{Thanks. I wanted something else...}
{413}{}{Thanks. I'll go try it out.}
{420}{}{Oh... we got us a discrimnatin' customer, eh? Well, at times, some prize pieces do make their way through town... take
 this, for example. (Holds up something... odd.) Genuine pre-war tech. Innit something?}
{423}{}{Uh... it's "something," all right. Can I take a look?}
{424}{}{Sure is. I was interested in something else, though...}
{425}{}{Not interested. Thanks anyway.}
{430}{}{(It's a pretty plastic square with holes in it and metal lines drawn all over it. Some funny word-symbol things are written on it. It reminds you of a mechanical pop-tart, and your mouth starts to water.)}
{431}{}{(It's what looks like a circuit board. It's a little dusty, but it looks to be in good condition. It looks like it's part of... something. Printed on the board is: 'Vault Tec voice recognition module.')}
{432}{}{(It's a complex circuit board. A memory chip is set into it, and a number of computer connections are on the side, including an input and output. Printed on the board is: 'Vault Tec voice recognition module.')}
{433}{}{Me vant tasty board}
{434}{}{Me vant sumfin else}
{435}{}{Me vant to go}
{436}{}{"Vault Tec?" This *has* to be important. How much?}
{437}{}{About time... how much for this module?}
{438}{}{No thanks, I wanted something else...}
{439}{}{Not today, thanks.}
{450}{}{Three thousand bucks. Take it or leave it.}
{451}{}{Last time: three thousand bucks. Take it or leave it.}
{452}{}{Okee-dokkeee}
{454}{}{Go for his throat and take the mechanical pop-tart}
{455}{}{Leaf it}
{457}{}{Uh, that's a little steep. How about...1500?}
{458}{}{No thanks. I wanted something else...}
{459}{}{I'll leave it.}
{470}{}{$2500. And that's my final offer.}
{471}{}{All right, all right. Here you go.}
{472}{}{Forget it, then. I wanted something else...}
{473}{}{No thanks, then. See you around.}
{474}{}{Too rich for my blood. Let's talk some other time when I have some more money.}
{480}{}{(Smiles, rubs hands as you lay the money on the table.) Awright, here you go. Anything else? }
{481}{}{(Thinks about it for a moment, studies you, then nods.) Awright then... I'm letting you have it for a steal, but
 here you go. (Hands you the module, takes your money.) }
{482}{}{Anything else?}
{485}{}{Yeah, I was interested in something else...}
{486}{}{Nothing else today, thanks.}
{495}{}{(Blinks in surprise, then laughs.) Haw! No, no... those weapons are something else, ain't they? Sure would LIKE
 to get my hands on one, though... check out the range, power, fire rate...(Stares into distance, sighs.)}
{496}{}{What if I offered to get you one?}
{497}{}{I'd be nice to have one, all right. Say, I wanted something else...}
{498}{}{Oh, well. Had to ask. Thanks, Eldridge.}
{505}{}{(Squints at you, as if deciding whether he can trust you.) I wouldn't say no... if you did it, quiet-like. I'd
 pay you for your trouble...(Frowns.)...assuming you didn't CAUSE any.}
{506}{}{No trouble at all... I have one on me. Here you go.}
{507}{}{I'll do it. Before I do, though, I wanted something else...}
{508}{}{Nevermind then. Maybe you can help me with something else...}
{509}{}{Done. I'll snag you one, then bring it back.}
{510}{}{Can't promise that... me and trouble seem to travel together. See you later, Eldridge.}
{520}{}{Well, piss on my back and tell me it's raining! }
{521}{}{Well, hell then! True to my word, here's something for your trouble... }
{522}{}{(Gives you a bunch of chips, takes the pistol.) Damn... strange lookin' thing, innnit? (Examines barrel.) Hmmm...}
{523}{}{I wanted something else...}
{524}{}{Pleasure doing business with you, Eldridge. Enjoy.}
{530}{}{(Eldridge looks you up and down, and his tone becomes more respectful.) Sure, of course. Let me show you our
 special stock... at a discount, of course.}
{532}{}{Actually, I was interested in something else...}
{533}{}{Nevermind. I'll be back.}
{545}{}{You dogs shut the hell up, y'hear?}
{546}{}{Shut up, you yapping mutts!}
{547}{}{Creatures of the night... shut up!}
{548}{}{Packard! Buck! Missy! You all better shut up, or I'm gonna come in there!}
{549}{}{One more WOOF outta you, and I'm coming in there!}
{550}{}{Damn dogs!}
{560}{}{What, you think I'm wearing a blindfold?}
{561}{}{Get yer hands offa that door!}
{562}{}{Don't mess with that door again.}
{563}{}{Touch that door, and that's the last thing you'll ever touch.}
{564}{}{Funny, last person who touched that door's buried on Golgotha. Don't touch it again.}
{575}{}{You ain't supposed to be there! Get out! Get outta there!}
{576}{}{You ain't allowed in the back! Get out!}
{577}{}{Get outta the back before I fill you full of holes!}
{578}{}{Stay in the back, and you're gonna be target practice!}
{600}{}{Boy we're closed... }
{601}{}{Missy we're closed... }
{610}{}{So I suggest you get the hell outta here before I shoot you dead.}
{700}{}{God damn dogs! I'm going back to bed.}
{701}{}{Stupid Dogs! I'm putting you all to sleep first thing tomorrow.}
{702}{}{Would you dogs shut up! Nobody's stupid enough to break into a gun store!}
{800}{}{You have delivered a laser pistol to Eldridge.}
{801}{}{Hey, do I look like some magician to you? You are gonna need the gun if you wanna upgrade it. Now get out of here and go find one I can upgrade... Sheesh!}
{802}{}{Come back when you got the money.}
{1340}{}{Sure as hell can. (Glances at your equipment.) But you don't look like you have anything I can tinker with.
 Bring by some virgin... eh, "normal" pistols and rifles, and I might be able to help you.}
{1345}{}{All right. I was interested in something else...}
{1346}{}{I'll do that. Goodbye.}
{5256}{}{...told me to stop by, and that you would "set me up."}
{5500}{}{.}
