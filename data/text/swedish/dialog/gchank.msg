{100}{}{You see a glowing ghoul with a concerned look on his face.}
{101}{}{You see Hank the glowing ghoul, a worker here in the power plant.}
{102}{}{You see a glowing ghoul monitoring some power plant gauges.}
{110}{}{Hello, I'm Hank. I take care of the inside of the reactor core. Not that much ever needs to be
 done there.}
{111}{}{Hello, nice of you to visit me again. Feels nice and toasty this close to the core. Most
 smoothies don't care for that.}
{112}{}{Hi, Hank. I need to get inside the Core.}
{113}{}{Hank, I have a coolant report from Harold that you need to see. Here you go.}
{114}{}{Hi there, Hank. I'm just taking the tour. Goodbye.}
{120}{}{Heh, heh. I wouldn't advise that, smoothy. You'd fry into a crisp. Me, I like the warmth, but I
 wouldn't recommend it for you. Quite a bit of heat and radiation in there. That's why the smoothies
 that built this place included a maintenance bot.}
{121}{}{Maintenance bot?}
{122}{}{Oh, thanks. Goodbye.}
{130}{}{Let me look this over. According to this, our coolant level is way too high. I would've thought
 that turning off the coolant would lead to immediate meltdown but I guess not. I'd better go turn off
 the coolant right now.}
{131}{}{That report said our coolant level was too high. I should turn off the coolant now, don't you
 think?}
{132}{}{Good thinking, Hank. I better be going. Goodbye.}
{133}{}{On second thought, maybe you should wait a moment on that. Let me check with Harold before you
 turn off the coolant. Goodbye.}
{140}{}{Yeah, the smoothies that built this place didn't want to fry either, so they included a robot.
 It was designed to perform maintenance tasks by remote control from that terminal over there.}
{141}{}{That's perfect. I can use that.}
{142}{}{I'll have to check that out. Goodbye.}
{150}{}{Nice part you got there. Just what we need.}
{151}{}{Glad you like it. Want to install it?}
{152}{}{Thanks, I really like it too. Goodbye.}
{160}{}{I'd like to help you out, but I wouldn't know how to install something like that. I mostly just
 watch the gauges here. Try Festus. He's the resident parts genius -- just ask him.}
{161}{}{Where is Festus?}
{162}{}{Is there any other way?}
{163}{}{Okay. Goodbye.}
{170}{}{You talk to Festus about installing that part yet?}
{171}{}{Where is he?}
{172}{}{Is there any other way?}
{173}{}{Not yet. Maybe I'll go do that now. Goodbye.}
{180}{}{Festus is out the way you came in. He's in the control room. Can't miss him... he's the smelly,
 whiny one tottering about underneath that huge ego. He should be able to help you.}
{181}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}
{190}{}{Well, if you could control the maintenance robot, it might be able to install it. Or, you could
 just walk in there and install it yourself.}
{191}{}{Maintenance robot?}
{192}{}{Install it myself?}
{200}{}{Well, it hasn't worked too well, lately. It kept overheating. We don't need to use it anyway, so
 we didn't bother to fix the heat shielding on it. If you can figure out the control codes and don't run
 it for too long, you may be able to get it to do what you want.}
{201}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}
{210}{}{Thanks for fixing the reactor.}
{211}{}{Is it cooler in here lately?}
{212}{}{Thanks for helping us out.}
{220}{}{I've never heard her hum like that.}
{221}{}{Purring like a kitten.}
{222}{}{Runs better than ever.}
{230}{}{Just stay out of the way and don't touch anything.}
{231}{}{How'd you get in here?}
{232}{}{Why don't you take a little walk through those doors. Glowing pit, pretty-pretty. Heh, heh,
 heh.}
{300}{}{You tricked Hank into starting a meltdown.}
{900}{}{Can't you see that I am busy?}
