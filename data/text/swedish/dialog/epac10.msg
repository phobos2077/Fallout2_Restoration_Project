{100}{}{You see Dex.}
{101}{}{You see a handsome, impeccably groomed man. Beneath an impressive shock of grease-slicked hair, his eyes
 sparkle with intensity... or perhaps insanity.}
{200}{}{[As you approach the cryogenic chamber, you see an attractive naked man sprawled on the floor. He draws
 his knees up and hugs them against his chest. He sits there for several moments, staring blankly ahead as his body
 quakes and his teeth chatter. Gradually, he seems to calm down.]}
{201}{}{Uh, hello?}
{210}{}{[He snaps his head towards you and leaps to his feet. He watches you intently, then glances around like a
 cornered animal. When his eyes return to you, they soften, and he relaxes as his memories come flooding back to him.
 He quickly alters his composure, projecting cool confidence, despite his nakedness.] I don't recognize you, bud.
 You don't mind if I get dressed do you?}
{211}{}{I guess there's no harm-}
{212}{}{Well, I-}
{220}{}{Of course you don't mind. Thanks, pal. [He steps past you and opens a nearby locker. He casually dresses himself
 in a finely tailored suit, then pockets the locker's contents. Utilizing a pocket comb, he begins to sculpt and style
 his slicked dark hair with the quick precision of a seasoned pro.] So, where's the doc? }
{221}{}{The doc? Oh, he's probably around here somewhere. In fact, I think he's on his way now, so I'll just mosey on out of here and let you two catch up. Bye!}
{222}{}{This may come as a shock to you, but you've been frozen for a very long time. Whoever "the doc" was, he's
 certainly long dead by now. If he was your friend, then I'm sorry.}
{223}{}{I don't mean to blow your mind, but you've been on ice for a *real* long time. I'm pretty sure your friend, "the doc", is long dead by now.}
{224}{}{Listen up, pretty boy. I didn't unthaw your psychotic ass so I could answer your questions and watch you groom
 yourself. I'm only letting you live long enough to tell me whatever useful information you might have. So start talking.
 The more you can tell me, the longer you get to live.}
{230}{}{[His cool demeanor vanishes and his eyes flare with rage.] You think you can intimidate ME? Do you have the first
 FUCKING CLUE who you're talking to? Come here and I'll show you what I'm capable of!}
{231}{}{[Done.]}
{240}{}{[Dex grins at you, revealing a set of perfect teeth-a product of pre-war dentistry that look strange to you in
 all their pearly white symmetry.] The doc, my friend? [He cocks an eyebrow.] You don't know who I am, do you?}
{241}{}{Uh, not exactly. I've been sort of wandering around this strange facility, tinkering with stuff, and I just so happened to unthaw you. Why were you frozen in there, anyway?}
{242}{}{Well, according to that computer, you're Dex, a narcissistic, sociopathic killer from before the great silence.
 I only unthawed you so I could put you down like the sick dog you are.}
{243}{}{Uh, not exactly. I'm sure you're a perfectly normal guy that was kept frozen for perfectly normal, non-evil reasons. Hell, what do I know? I've been sort of wandering around this strange facility, tinkering with stuff, and I just so happened to unthaw you.}
{250}{}{[Dex takes another look around the room and whistles.] This place has really gone to shit. How long did you say it's been?}
{251}{}{It's been over a hundred and fifty years since the Great Silence brought an end to the Old Ones... *your* people.}
{260}{}{Great Silence? The Old Ones? How about you spare me this cryptic bullshit and just tell me what happened?}
{261}{}{The Great Silence is what my people call the end of your world. When the great fires rained down from the sky and scorched the land. You'll find the world is nothing like the one you knew.}
{270}{}{No shit, so they actually dropped the bombs, huh? I guess the vault project wasn't just a big waste of the
 tax-payers' money, after all.}
{271}{}{Wait. You know of the holy vaults?}
{280}{}{Know of them? Hell, I used to live right by the Chicago vault. I even watched 'em finish building the thing.
 Then of course they started doing those damn drills... [He stops and regards you with amusement.] You're really eating
 this up, aren't you?}
{281}{}{TELL ME MORE OF THE VAULTS!}
{282}{}{Well, you see, I've been chosen by my people to try and find a Vault. There, I hope to retrieve a G.E.C.K. and
 use its power to save my village from destruction. Anything you can tell me of the Vaults could help me in my quest.}
{283}{}{Well, you see, I had been chosen by my people to try and find a Vault. After risking my life in countless adventures,
 I finally discovered the Holy 13. However, I'm curious what else you might know of these places.}
{290}{}{I'll tell you what, bud. You need help finding these Vaults, and I need someone to show me the ropes, so to speak,
 in this crazy world of yours. So what do you say... partner?}
{291}{}{Hmm, your knowledge of the old ones could prove quite useful to me... But, well, honestly, I, uh, read about you
 in that computer over there, and I'm not sure you're the type of guy I'd want to travel with.}
{292}{}{I don't really have the time to "show you the ropes". I'm sure you'll do just fine on your own, "bud".}
{293}{}{I say you've got a deal... partner.}
{294}{}{I don't think I'm too eager to go gallivanting around the wasteland with a psychotic murderer. So you're on your
 own, "bud". Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be just fine. [Snicker.]}
{300}{}{Whoa, stop right there. Let me guess, you read I was some kind of crazy murderer, right? Well bud, I've got two
 words for you: Bull. Shit. Don't you buy a word of it.}
{301}{}{But that doesn't make any sense, why would they lie about you?}
{302}{}{The only bullshit around here is what's spewing out of your mouth, and I think it's time I shut you up for good.}
{310}{}{Hey, I know it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but have you looked around this place? There's not much
 sense to be made around here. Who knows what goes on in the fucked up minds of these scientists. }
{311}{}{Hmm... you've got a point, there. I'm not saying I believe you... but I guess I can at least hear you out.}
{312}{}{Yeah, no kidding. Go on...}
{320}{}{Alright, you see, it's all part of their "experiments". These crazy fucking doctors were doing some kind of tests on
 the "nature of human evil" or some crap. They were injecting me with the memories of a maniac in order to see how it
 would affect the personality of a normal person. At least, that's the best I could figure it.}
{321}{}{Well... if that's true, then that's terrible. But what made them choose you as a test subject in the first place?}
{322}{}{Wow man, that really sucks. Anyway, that's all the in past now. Those asshole scientists are long dead and won't
 be able to mess with you anymore. Come along with me and we'll get out of this place.}
{330}{}{Heh, you see that's the funny thing. *I* actually came to *them*. Answered an ad they put out saying they'd pay big
 bucks for healthy test subjects. I needed the money, and, well, it turned out to be the worst mistake of my life.
 I can't even begin to tell you the horrors they subjected me to. [His eyes shimmer with tears as he reflects. He sighs
 deeply and wipes the tears away.] Anyway, thanks to you, bud, I'm finally free of that nightmare.}
{331}{}{Huh. Well, I'm glad I could help... I think.}
{332}{}{Actually, asshole, your nightmare's just begun, because I'm not buying a word of this.}
{340}{}{So how 'bout it, pal? Can we partner up? Not only will you get to feel cooler by hanging out me, but I can handle
 myself in a fight. Hell, I'd be alright with going solo, but I've got no clue what kind of crazy shit is lurking out
 there now. For all I know, the first tree I piss on could open up its mouth and bite my cock off.}
{341}{}{Alright, you can travel with me, but I'm gonna keep a close eye on you. The second you even think about stepping
 out of line, I'll put you down.}
{342}{}{Sure, I suppose we could partner up. Welcome to the team, Dex.}
{343}{}{That was a damn good story, and you're not a bad actor, which makes you all the more dangerous. I think I'll
 do the wastelands a favor and remove you before you can do anymore harm.}
{350}{}{[Dex's grin falters and his eyes become unfocused. After a moment, he begins speaking without meeting your eyes.]
 I was one of their sick experiments. They did... terrible things to me. [He shakes his head, then looks at you with a renewed grin.]
 I'd rather not talk about it, you know? The name's Dex, by the way.}
{351}{}{Sorry to hear that, Dex. Anyway, that's all in the past now. The real, *real* distant past.}
{352}{}{Look, Dex, I might be able to help you, but I'd like to know who I'm dealing with. What exactly did they do to you?}
{360}{}{[Dex takes another look around the room and whistles.] No kidding. This place has really gone to shit. How long did you say it's been?}
{370}{}{Alright, you really need to know? Fine. Basically, these crazy fucking doctors were doing some kind of tests on the "nature of human evil" or some crap.
 They injected me with the memories of a maniac in order to see how it would affect the personality of a decent, law abiding fella like me. At least, that's the best I could figure it.}
{371}{}{I see. So, how *did* it affect you? }
{372}{}{I don't know, it gave me some nightmares, alright? Look, I've been frozen for who knows how long, and I'm not in the mood for a fucking interrogation.
 You're almost as bad as the Doc... Did you say he's dead? How long was I out for anyway? This place looks like shit.}
{400}{}{[As you approach the cryogenic chamber, you see an attractive naked man sprawled on the floor. He draws his
 knees up and hugs them against his chest. He sits there for several moments, staring blankly ahead as his body quakes
 and his teeth chatter. Gradually, he seems to calm down.]}
{401}{}{Uh, hello?}
{410}{}{[He snaps his head towards you and leaps to his feet. He watches you intently, then glances around like a
 cornered animal. When his eyes return to you, they soften, and he relaxes as his memories come flooding back to him.
 He quickly alters his composure, projecting cool confidence, despite his nakedness.] Hey doll, I know I'm quite the
 sight to behold, but it's a tad chilly in here. You mind if I get dressed?}
{411}{}{I guess there's no harm-}
{412}{}{Well, I-}
{420}{}{Of course you don't mind. Thanks, babe. [He steps past you, gently slapping your rump, and opens a nearby locker.
 He casually dresses himself in a finely tailored suit, then pockets the locker's contents. Utilizing a pocket comb,
 he begins to sculpt and style his slicked dark hair with the quick precision of a seasoned pro.] I don't think I've
 seen you around, doll, and I doubt I'd forget a face like yours. Name's Dex, but I'm sure you know that. Mind if I ask yours?}
{421}{}{Jag är }
{422}{}{. But you should know I've got a strict rule of not dating any strange men I unthaw. Since you've been on ice for the past century and a half, I'll assume your hand spasmed and accidentally slapped my ass. But if it happens again, I'll rip your cock off. Got it?}
{423}{}{My name's }
{424}{}{. It's nice to meet you, Dex. I can't imagine what it must be like to wake up after being frozen for over a hundred and fifty years.}
{425}{}{Yeah, I DO mind, you fucking creep. I only unthawed you so I could put you down like the sick dog you are.}
{426}{}{Forget about names. How 'bout you take those clothes back off and show me what pre-war men are made of.}
{430}{}{[Grins and begins to undress.] You're my kind of gal. Prepare yourself to experience Dex, the Duke of Sex.}
{431}{}{[Continue.]}
{440}{}{[After an intense love making session on the floor of the chamber, the two of you collapse in exhaustion. Dex
 holds a small object near your mouth.] Scream for her, baby. [Just as you realize it's a severed human ear, you feel a blade pierce your chest. You scream as the blade is pulled out and plunged back in...]}
{441}{}{[End.]}
{450}{}{Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up a second, sweetheart. Did you just say a hundred and fifty years? [He shakes his head in  disbelief.] That is un-fucking-believable. [He checks out his reflection.] But you gotta admit, I'm looking damn good for my age. [He grins at you, revealing a set of perfect teeth-a product of pre-war dentistry that looks strange to you in all  their pearly white symmetry.]}
{451}{}{Sure, some girls might find you attractive, but I'm finding it hard to look past the fact that you're a cold-blooded murderous psycho.}
{452}{}{Yes, you're very attractive, but honestly, I'm a bit nervous to talk to you after what I read about you being a murderous psycho.}
{453}{}{Alright, this is sickening. Let's see how great you look after I put a couple holes in your face.}
{454}{}{Not bad for an ice man. Why were you frozen in there, anyway?}
{455}{}{Eh, you're not my type. Anyway, why were you frozen in there?}
{456}{}{Alright, this is sickening. Let's see how great you look after I put a couple holes in your face.}
{460}{}{OK, where are you getting this crap about me being a "murderous psycho"?}
{461}{}{Don't try to bullshit me. I read about you on that computer.}
{462}{}{That computer over there had some kind of bio on you, and it had some pretty terrible things in it.}
{463}{}{I can sense it. You give off this vibe.}
{464}{}{Don't try to bullshit me. I know people like you.}
{470}{}{Ah, now it makes sense. Look, don't worry about that, it's not what you think. I'll explain everything in a
 second. But first of all, would you mind telling me what the hell's happened since they put me on ice? I mean, this
 place has gone to shit, and you look like you've walked out of some kind of sci-fi adventure tale.}
{471}{}{It's been over a hundred and fifty years since the great silence brought an end to the Old Ones... *your* people.}

{500}{}{I'll tell you what, babe. You need help finding these Vaults, and I need someone to show me the ropes, so to speak, in this crazy world of yours. So what do you say... partner?}
{501}{}{I say you've got a deal... partner.}
{502}{}{Well, your knowledge of the old ones could prove quite useful to me... but, you know, there's that whole psychotic murderer thing...}

 own, "babe". Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be just fine. [snicker.]}
{510}{}{Hey, like I told you, I can explain. Everything you read about me was complete bullshit. Don't you buy a word of it.}
{511}{}{Hey, like I told you, I can explain. These evil vibes you are getting from me are the result of the scientists who
 experimented on me.}
{512}{}{But that doesn't make any sense. What was done to you?}
{513}{}{Bullshit. I think it's time I shut you up for good.}

 Anyway, I'd much rather talk about you, babe.}
{561}{}{Oh, well, let's see... I was born and raised in the village of Arroyo. My mother is the village elder, and we're direct descendants of the legendary vault dwel--}
{562}{}{Look, Dex, I might be able to help you, but I'd like to know who I'm dealing with. What exactly did they do to you?}
{570}{}{Wow, that's real interesting, babe, and I can't wait to hear more about you. Honest. But first of all, how 'bout you fill me in on what the hell happened since they put me on ice.
 I mean, this place has gone to shit, and you look like you've walked out of some kind of sci-fi adventure tale.}
{580}{}{Alright, you really need to know? Fine. Basically, these crazy fucking doctors were doing some kind of tests on the "nature of human evil" or some crap.

{581}{}{I see. So, how *did* it affect you?}
{582}{}{I don't know, it gave me some nightmares, alright? Look honey, I've been through a lot and I'm not in the mood for a fucking interrogation right now.
 I answered your questions, now how 'bout you you fill me on what the hell happened since they put me on ice. I mean, this place has gone to shit, and you look like you've walked out of some kind of sci-fi adventure tale.}
{600}{}{[As you approach the cryogenic chamber, you see an attractive naked man sprawled on the floor. He draws his knees
 up and hugs them against his chest. He sits there for several moments, staring blankly ahead as his body quakes and his
 teeth chatter. Gradually, he seems to calm down.]}
{601}{}{Uh, hey...}
{610}{}{[He snaps his head towards you and leaps to his feet. He watches you intently, then glances around like a cornered
 animal. When his eyes return to you, they soften, and he relaxes as his memories come flooding back to him. He quickly

{611}{}{I guess there's no harm-}

{620}{}{Of course you don't mind. Thanks, pal. [He steps past you and opens a nearby locker. He casually dresses himself
 in a finely tailored suit, then pockets the locker's contents. Utilizing a pocket comb, he begins to sculpt and style his
 slicked dark hair with the quick precision of a seasoned pro.] So, where's the doc? }
{621}{}{Beats me. Wherever he is, he's long dead by now. You see, you've been doing that popsicle impression for a REAL long time.}
{622}{}{Listen up, pretty boy. I didn't unthaw your psychotic ass so I could answer your questions and watch you groom yourself.
 I'm only letting you live long enough to tell me whatever useful information you might have. So start talking. The more
 you can tell me, the longer you get to live.}
{630}{}{Is that so? [He regards you curiously.] You don't exactly look like you belong here, bud, yet you've decided to
 release me and I'd like to know why. I assume you know who I am?}
{631}{}{Yeah, you're Dex, right? If what I read about you is true, then you're one evil son of a bitch. I like that.}
{632}{}{Well, according to that computer, you're Dex, a narcissistic, sociopathic killer from before the great silence.
 I only unthawed you so I could put you down like the sick dog you are.}
{633}{}{No idea, but you are giving off these evil vibes and I approve.}
{640}{}{[His cool demeanor vanishes and his eyes flare with rage.] You think you can intimidate ME? Do you have the first

{650}{}{[Dex grins at you, revealing a set of perfect teeth-a product of pre-war dentistry that look strange to you in all

 also a fan of The King?}
{651}{}{Uh.... [Blank stare.]}
{652}{}{Oh yeah, I love that... uh, what'd you call it, The King? Yeah, huge fan.}

 Those were the days... [He stops and regards you with amusement.] You're really eating this up, aren't you?}
{681}{}{TELL ME MORE OF THE VAULTS!}
{682}{}{Well, I'm supposed to be trying to find a Vault for my tribe. Once I do, I'm expected to find a G.E.C.K. so we
 can use its power to save my dying village. Anything you can tell me about the Vaults could make my job a hell of a lot easier.}

{691}{}{Hell, no need to try and convince me. I'd be happy to have you along just to see your handiwork first hand.}
{692}{}{I don't know, Dex. Let's just say I let you come along with me, and we make it back to the remote safety of a
 settlement. Once there, how do I know you won't try and slit my throat the first chance you get?}
{700}{}{I can tell you're no saint, so I could ask you the same thing. But to answer your question, I wouldn't kill you
 because that'd fuck me over. I'll be honest, }
{701}{}{, I don't give a fuck about anyone, or anything, except for myself. If the world is as fucked up as you say it is,
 then sticking with you is the best shot I've got. It's as simple as that.}
{702}{}{Fair enough. Let's go.}
{703}{}{I'm just fucking with you Dex. I never actually had any intention of bringing you with me. I just thought I'd
 have a bit of fun with you before caving your skull in.}

 you around, doll, and I doubt I'd forget a face like yours. Name's, Dex, but I'm sure you know that. Mind if I ask yours?}
{821}{}{Jag är }
{822}{}{. But you should know I've got a strict rule of not dating any strange men I unthaw. Since you've been on ice for the past century and a half, I'll assume your hand spasmed and accidentally slapped my ass. But if it happens again, I'll rip your cock off. Got it?}
{823}{}{My name's }
{824}{}{. It's nice to meet you, Dex. I can't imagine what it must be like to wake up after being frozen for over a hundred
and fifty years.}
{825}{}{Yeah, I DO mind, you fucking creep. I only unthawed you so I could put you down like the sick dog you are.}
{826}{}{Forget about names. How 'bout you take those clothes back off and show me what pre-war men are made of.}
{830}{}{[Grins and begins to undress.] You're my kind of gal. Prepare yourself to experience Dex, the Duke of Sex.}
{831}{}{[After an intense love making session on the floor of the chamber, the two of you collapse in exhaustion. You
 notice Dex slyly going for a hidden knife. You quickly clutch his genitals.]}
{832}{}{Touch that knife, and I'll turn you into the Dickless Duke. Besides, why ruin a good thing? The two of us could
 have so much fun together.}
{833}{}{I... think I'm in love. [Dex has joined your party.]}
{840}{}{Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up a second, sweetheart. Did you just say a hundred and fifty years? [He shakes his head in disbelief.]
 That is un-fucking-believable. [He checks out his reflection.] But you gotta admit, I'm looking damn good for my age. [He grins at you, revealing a set of perfect teeth-a product of pre-war dentistry that look strange to you in all their
 pearly white symmetry.]}
{841}{}{Sure, some girls might think you're an attractive guy, but I'm sure they're a bit put off by that whole murderous
 psycho thing you've got going on.}
{842}{}{Alright, this is sickening. Let's see how great you look after I put a couple holes in your face.}
{843}{}{Sure, some girls might think you're an attractive guy, but I'm sure they're a bit put off by the murderous
 psycho vibes you're giving off.}
{844}{}{Not bad for an ice man. Why were you frozen in there, anyway?}
{845}{}{Eh, you're not my type. Anyway, why were you frozen in there?}
{846}{}{Alright, this is sickening. Let's see how great you look after I put a couple holes in your face.}
{850}{}{Well they usually don't see that side of me until it's too late. But anyways... [Dex takes another look around the room and whistles.]
 This place has really gone to shit. So what have I missed out on?}
{851}{}{It's been over a hundred and fifty years since the great silence brought an end to the Old Ones... *your* people.}
{855}{}{Great Silence? The Old Ones? How about you spare me this cryptic bullshit and just tell me what happened?}
{856}{}{The Great Silence is what my people call the end of your world. When the great fires rained down from the sky and scorched the land.
 You'll find the world is nothing like the one you knew.}
{860}{}{No shit, so they actually dropped the bombs, huh? I guess the vault project wasn't just a big waste of the tax-payers' money, after all.}
{861}{}{Wait. You know of the vaults?}
{870}{}{Know of them? Hell, I killed my first hooker not far from where they were building the Chicago Vault. Those were the
 days... [He stops and regards you with amusement.] You're really eating this up, aren't you?}
{871}{}{TELL ME MORE OF THE VAULTS!}
{872}{}{Well, I'm supposed to be trying to find a Vault for my tribe. Once I do, I'm expected to find a G.E.C.K. so we
 can use its power to save my dying village. Anything you can tell me about the Vaults could make my job a hell of a lot  easier.}
{873}{}{Well, you see, I had been chosen by my people to try and find a Vault. I risked my life on several occasions to
 find that damn Holy Vault and I finally was successful in finding it. I am curious what else you might know of these  places.}
{880}{}{I'll tell you what, babe. You need help finding these Vaults, and I need someone to show me the ropes, so to speak,
 in this crazy world of yours. So what do you say... partner?}
{881}{}{Hell, no need to try and convince me. I'd be happy to have you along just to see your handiwork first hand.}
{882}{}{I don't know, Dex. Let's just say I let you come along with me, and we make it back to the remote safety of a settlement.
 Once there, how do I know you won't try and slit my throat the first chance you get?}
{883}{}{I say you've got a deal... partner.}
{884}{}{Well, your knowledge of the old ones could prove quite useful to me... I suppose you've got a deal.}
{885}{}{I don't really have the time to "show you the ropes". I'm sure you'll do just fine on your own, "babe".}
{890}{}{I can tell you're no saint either, so I could ask you the same thing. But to answer your question, I wouldn't kill
 you because that'd fuck me over. I'll be honest, }
{891}{}{, I don't give a fuck about anyone, or anything, except for myself. If the world is as fucked up as you say it is,
 then sticking with you is the best shot I've got. It's as simple as that.}
{892}{}{Fair enough. Lets go.}
{893}{}{I'm just fucking with you Dex. I never had any intention of bringing you with me. I just thought I'd have a bit
 of fun with you before caving your skull in.}
{900}{}{We'll get to that in a second. But first of all, how 'bout you fill me in on what the hell happened since they put me on ice.
 I mean, this place has gone to shit, and you look like you've walked out of some kind of sci-fi adventure tale.}
{1000}{}{What's the word?}
{1001}{}{[Dex cocks an eyebrow at you.] Something up?}
{1002}{}{Speak to me.}
{1003}{}{[Dex smiles.] What's up, pal?}
{1004}{}{You need something?}
{1005}{}{What can Dex do for ya?}
{1010}{}{What's the word?}
{1011}{}{[Dex cocks an eyebrow at you.] Something up, babe?}
{1012}{}{Speak to me baby.}
{1013}{}{[Dex smiles.] What's up, doll?}
{1014}{}{You need something? Anything? [Dex grins.]}
{1015}{}{What can Dex do for ya baby?}
{1100}{}{We ready to roll?}
{1101}{}{We takin' off, or what?}
{1102}{}{You ready yet? I'm itchin' to move.}
{1103}{}{So, you realized you're better off with me, huh?}
{1104}{}{We going now? I'm not in the habit of waiting around for others.}
{1105}{}{Come on. I was frozen for over a hundred and fifty years. I'm eager to move.}
{1106}{}{I'm getting impatient over here.}
{1110}{}{You ready to take me with you?}
{1111}{}{Let's go.}
{1112}{}{No, not yet.}
{1200}{}{So, what can you tell me about the Vaults?}
{1201}{}{So, now do you remember anything you can tell me about the Vaults?}
{1202}{}{Is there anything useful you can tell me about the time before the Great Silence?}
{1210}{}{Well, lets see... Huh. You know what? My mind's still a little foggy about some things. You'll have to ask me later.}
{1211}{}{Hmm. Alright.}
{1220}{}{The vaults... the vaults... Nope, not yet.}
{1221}{}{Hmm. Alright.}
{1230}{}{Yes, actually, I remember... Wait, never mind, I forgot.}
{1231}{}{Hmm. Alright.}
{1240}{}{Well, I used to live by the Chicago Vault. Does that help?}
{1241}{}{Do you know if it had a G.E.C.K.?}
{1242}{}{I'm sure it did. I'm pretty sure they all did.}
{1243}{}{Alright, now we're on to something. Can you tell me where this Vault is located?}
{1244}{}{No problem. It's about 2,000 miles in that direction. [Dex points eastward.]}
{1245}{}{Oh. Well then. Never mind.}
{1250}{}{There was one man, greater than any other, that we called, "The King". He was a handsome man with impeccable
 style, amazing hair, and a voice of gold. With a simple thrust of his pelvis he could impregnate every woman in sight.
 He was worshiped as a God by the people of the world. He was my father.}
{1251}{}{Interesting...}
{1260}{}{There were immortals that lived secretly among us. They had to battle each other to the death with swords until
 only one remained to claim "The Prize".}
{1261}{}{Wait. If they were immortal, how could they kill each other?}
{1262}{}{They could only be killed by decapitation. When one immortal decapitated another, a quickening
 would be released, giving the slain immortal's powers to the victor.}
{1263}{}{What exactly do you mean by "powers"?}
{1264}{}{Uh, fighting powers? Mechanic powers? I don't know, it was kind of vague.}
{1265}{}{Interesting...}
{1270}{}{There were these giant lizards, some bigger than buildings, that people would ride around on. We called them
 dinosaurs, and they were known as man's best friend.}
{1271}{}{Wow, did you have one?}
{1272}{}{Of course. I rode a T-rex, the most badass giant lizard of them all. Only mine was even more badass because it had wings. Basically, it was a dragon.}
{1273}{}{Interesting...}
{1280}{}{In the year 2011, The Awaking took place, and long dormant magical creatures, like Orcs, Elves, Trolls, and
 Dwarves returned to the world, along with magic. Magic and technology then clashed in a dark world of corporate warfare,
 waged in the shadows of the sprawling metropolises.}
{1281}{}{Wow, what happened to the magical creatures?}
{1282}{}{I guess they got taken out when the bombs fell. Except it looks like you've still got some Dwarves, Trolls,
 and Zombies around.}
{1283}{}{Interesting...}
{1290}{}{There was this gigantic green lizard called Godzilla. Godzilla would alternate between terrorizing Japan,
 and saving its ass against giant space invaders. There was another violent gigantic lizard called the Tarrasque. I think they were cousins or something.}
{1291}{}{Wow, what happened to them?}
{1292}{}{Godzilla got taken out by Ferris Bueller. As for the Tarrasque, we had a giant robot battle him. The robot,
 piloted by yours truly, punched the Tarrasque so hard that be broke apart into thousands of little Tarrasques that
 scattered all over California.}
{1293}{}{Interesting...}
{1300}{}{The earth was full of hot women, and I held the world record for the amount of sexual partners I had.}
{1301}{}{I see. You know, Dex, some of these things you're telling me are a bit... out there. I get this strange feeling
 that it might not all be true.}
{1302}{}{Hey, were YOU alive back then? No, you weren't. So who's the pre-war expert here? So trust me, it's all true.
 But hey, if you're not going to believe me, then I'm done telling you stories for now.}
{1303}{}{Huh. That's too bad, because they've been so helpful so far.}
{1400}{}{Just tell me where you want me.}
{1401}{}{Just tell me where you want me, babe.}
{1402}{}{No problem. I wouldn't want to make you nervous. [Dex grins.]}
{1403}{}{Sure. If you think you need to keep an eye on me, I'm fine with that.}
{1404}{}{Sure. I understand it's hard to concentrate when I'm too close. [Dex grins.]}
{1405}{}{[Dex cocks his eyebrow at you and winks.]}
{1406}{}{No problem.}
{1500}{}{Why? You don't trust me with weapons? [He laughs.] Sure thing, if it'll put your mind at ease.}
{1600}{}{Uh, sure. But just so we're on the same page here, you know I'm into chicks... right?}
{1601}{}{All-right. [Dex strips off his armor and begins stripping off his clothes. He stops when he sees you glaring
 at him.] You're sending me mixed signals here, doll. Dex doesn't like to be toyed with. Just the armor it is.}
{1700}{}{Well, I can do wondrous things with knives. It's like an art. There's something very special about the way a
 blade slices into flesh, you know what I mean?}
{1701}{}{Uh... yeah, sure. Anything else you can use? Feel free to be less creepy about it this time.}
{1702}{}{Well, my Uncle was one of them military hard-asses. He trained me with pistols and SMGs, and I even got to toy
 around with some energy weapon prototypes they were working on. He thought I'd follow in his footsteps and be a
 puppet for Uncle Sam, but I, uh... Let's just say I went down a different path.}
{1703}{}{That sounds alright. Anything else?}
{1704}{}{I've been known to beat some ass with good 'ol fisticuffs. When I was a teen, I tried my hand at Karate for
 awhile, but they kept feeding me all this shit about being more disciplined, so I told 'em to fuck off. Anything else you need to know?}
{1705}{}{That should cover it. Thanks.}
{1800}{}{I'm good to go.}
{1801}{}{I've been better, but I can handle it.}
{1802}{}{I'm not feeling very good.}
{1803}{}{I think I hear the King calling. I can see the light...}
{1900}{}{No problem. But you're going to feel a lot less cool without me around. Just saying...}
{1901}{}{Sure. I'll catch ya later.}
{1902}{}{Sure, I'll wait. But if you don't come back, then I'm going to start looking for you, and it won't be pleasant
 when I find you.}
{1903}{}{Alright, as long as you aren't just ditching me to make room for some other jerk. Because I promise you I'm
 better than them in every conceivable way.}
{1904}{}{No problem.}
{1905}{}{No problem, babe.}
{1906}{}{Alright, as long as you aren't just ditching me to make room for some other jerk. Because I promise you I'm
 better than them in every conceivable way.}
{1907}{}{Getting you too hot and bothered am I? I understand.}
{2000}{}{Alright, what about it?}
{2001}{}{Look, I know I was on ice for a long time, but trust me, everything is in PERFECT working order. If you want,
 I'll prove it to you right here, right now. [Dex stops when he sees you glaring] Oh, I see, my *other* gear. What about it?}
{2010}{}{It's a bit crowded. Let me know if things open up.}
{2020}{}{No way in hell I'm traveling with you. You're ugly as fuck.}
{2030}{}{Let's roll.}
{2031}{}{About time we got goin' again.}
{3000}{}{So, what's your story?}
{3001}{}{What, like my life story? Look, I know I'm pretty fascinating, but I don't want to stand around talking forever.
 My mouth will get all dry and there's not a whole lot of water to go around-it's just not a good situation to be in.
 But I suppose I could sum it up for you if you really want to know... Actually, I DO like to talk about myself so I'll
 leave up to you. You want the quick summary or the version with more detail?}
{3002}{}{Just give me the quick summary.}
{3003}{}{Lets hear the detailed version.}
{3004}{}{Never mind, I lost interest.}
{3010}{}{Alright, basically, ever since I was a kid, I liked to kill things. I could talk about my childhood and my
 shitty parents and try to analyze why I like to do it, but I don't need an excuse. I do it simply because I can, and
 it's fun. By the time I was sixteen I spent my days as a popular high school heartthrob, and my nights as a ripper of
 Chicago's young working girls.}
{3011}{}{Uh huh. Go on.}
{3012}{}{Then one day I caught my girlfriend making the beast with two backs with another guy. I butchered them, set
 the place on fire, then high tailed it out of Chicago. Spent the next ten years traveling the nation, seducing girls,
 then cutting 'em up. Then they finally caught me, and my trail turned me into a celebrity.}
{3013}{}{So, then what?}
{3014}{}{So then one of my new fans, Alice, helps me escape. The two of us go on a three week cross country murder rampage
 before we finally go down in a shootout. Then, for some reason, The Man decides to stitch me back together and run all
 these tests on me. And that's how I wound up at the EPA where you found me.}
{3015}{}{Thanks for the story.}
{3020}{}{Let's see.... My Mom was a drug fiend and a whore, and my Dad was an ornery drunken bastard. Fortunately, my
 grandpa was alright for an old guy. Introduced me to The King's music. Unfortunately, he was claimed by the New Plague
 when I was seven. Then when I was ten, I watched from the closet as my Dad beat my Mom to death for forgetting to feed
 our dog, Captain Robeenie.}
{3021}{}{This is off to a pleasant start. Go on.}
{3022}{}{The bitch should've remembered to feed the Captain. Go on.}
{3023}{}{So they put my Dad away and shipped me off to live with my Aunt and Uncle. You see, I was a little hell-raiser,
 even then, and my Uncle, being a military sort, thought he'd be able to straighten me out-turn me into a Red slaying
 soldier boy, just like the son he'd lost. He gave it his best shot, but I was a stubborn son-of-a-bitch.}
{3024}{}{Uh huh. Go on.}
{3025}{}{So anyway, we did a lot of moving around and it wasn't until I was in high school that we finally settled down
 in Chicago. That's when I took to sneaking out at night and knifing hookers. I'd been killing things for as long as I
 could remember, but gutting neighborhood critters didn't compare to the real deal, you know?}
{3026}{}{Visst.}
{3027}{}{So things were pretty sweet, for the most part. I mean, I fucking hated my Uncle and Aunt, but at school I was
 Mr. Popular. Every guy wanted to be my friend and every gal I looked at was willing to spread for me. Except for this
 one gal, Vicky. She actually took a bit of work. Amazing, I know, but eventually I got her to come around and become my girl.}
{3028}{}{And all the while you were moonlighting as a serial killer?}
{3029}{}{I don't really care about your high school sweetheart. Forget the story.}
{3030}{}{Yeah. [Dex grins.] Those were the days. I was actually happy, you know? After we graduated, Vicky and I got our
 own little place together, and everything was aces. But that bitch had to go and ruin everything by sneaking around behind my back.}
{3031}{}{How dare she.}
{3032}{}{I caught her in the act, and I lost it. Things got real brutal. It was sloppy and there was no way I was going to
 be able to just cover it up. So I set the place on fire and hit the road. Did a lot of traveling, laid a lot of girls and
 left most of 'em dead. It wasn't a bad life, you know? It took 'em ten years, but the law finally caught up with me.}
{3033}{}{Uh-oh. So then what?}
{3034}{}{Then they put me on trial and it became a bit of media circus. The girls loved it because I'm a dreamboat,
 and everyone else loved it because it was a distraction from news about the New Plague and politics. So I thought I'd
 give 'em a real show.}
{3035}{}{What'd you do?}
{3036}{}{Well by then I'd made plenty of fans, but there was this one in particular, a real doll named Alice. She said
 she loved me and would do anything for me. So during my trail, she helped me make a break for it. It was a long shot,
 but we were lucky enough to pull it off. Then things got crazy... Are you sure you never heard about any of this?}
{3037}{}{I'm sure, but go on.}
{3038}{}{Never heard of it, and now I never want to. Just forget it, I'm bored.}
{3039}{}{Well now that I was with Alice, it was kind of hard to revert back to my old ways of seducing women and slicing
 them open. Instead, we just starting thrill killing anyone that was convenient. It didn't matter how young or old, we
 were equal opportunity killers. But killing recklessly like that, we were easy to track. In three weeks they had us
 cornered. They gunned me down and Alice blew her own brains out.}
{3040}{}{I see. Then what?}
{3041}{}{So there I was, certain I was going to die, but then these G-Men stepped in and took me away. They got me back
 to a hundred percent, then started doing these tests on me, trying to figure out what makes me the way I am... Anyway,
 you can figure the rest, and my throats dry from talking. Damn, I was hoping to avoid that.}
{3042}{}{Thanks for the story.}
{3100}{}{Any tips you might be able to give me?}
{3101}{}{Tips? What kind of tips?}
{3102}{}{Well, I'm sure you've got some skill.}
{3103}{}{Oh, I've got all *kinds* of skills. But if you're looking for advice... [He looks you over, then nods.] Alright,
 what the hell. I'll give you some pointers that'll have the ladies crawling at your feet. Now, the first thing you gotta do is...}
{3104}{}{You wanna see my skills? I'll show you my skills anytime, sweetheart. But if you're looking for advice...
 [He looks you over, then nods.] Alright, what the hell. I'll give you some pointers that'll have the fellas eating out of
 your hands. Now, the first thing you gotta do is...}
{3105}{}{There you go. Now don't be telling other people these trade secrets.}
{3106}{}{Tack.}
{4000}{}{Man do I love the post-nuclear future.}
{4001}{}{Come on. Let's have some violence.}
{4002}{}{Let's find some more young ladies to, uh, admire.}
{4003}{}{Let us seek more carnal knowledge.}
{4004}{}{You ever just sprawl a girl out on a bed and cut her open? I tell ya, absolute beauty.}
{4005}{}{I really need to cut something soon...}
{4006}{}{You'd think a corpse would be terrible in bed, but you'd be surprised.}
{4007}{}{[singing] I put an ax in my baby's head, I'm gonna end up doing time... she looked so good in red...[singing]}
{4008}{}{[singing] 'caus I'm eviiillllll, my middle name is, miseerryyy...[singing]}
{4009}{}{You dig my suit? This sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.}
{4010}{}{So... where about the wasteland do you think they keep the hair gel?}
{4011}{}{I know it sounds a bit gross, but don't knock deep fried ovaries 'til you've tried 'em.}
{4012}{}{[Removes pocket comb and fixes hair.]}
{4020}{}{Hey! I'm fuckin' bleeding over here.}
{4021}{}{Oh man, I'm not doing too well.}
{4022}{}{Get me to a fucking doctor.}
{4023}{}{You gonna just stand there and watch me bleed to death or are you going to do something about this?}
{4030}{}{I'm feeling a little weird over here...}
{4031}{}{Hey, I'm feeling a bit radiated. If this isn't the kind that grants super powers, then I'm going to be pissed.}
{4040}{}{You know, you're a bad influence.}
{4041}{}{I try to stay away from this stuff. But if you insist...}
{4042}{}{My body's a temple, but I guess this once won't hurt.}
{4043}{}{If this does any permanent damage, I'm going to cut you.}
{4045}{}{I feel much better now.}
{4046}{}{Much better.}
{4050}{}{Hey! Watch the hair.}
{4051}{}{Hey, you don't rush perfection.}
{4060}{}{It just isn't the same when their blood's still warm, ya know?}
{4061}{}{I hope you took notes.}
{4062}{}{Girls have gotten pretty freaky since the end of the world... I dig that.}
{4063}{}{...and thats why the babes used to call me "Dex, the Duke of Sex".}
{4070}{}{I feel nauseated. I think I'm poisoned.}
{4071}{}{I feel like I'm gonna puke my guts out.}
{4080}{}{I can't move this limb. I need medical attention.}
{4081}{}{I think I lost feeling in this limb. Is that bad?}
{4090}{}{It just got really blurry. Where'd everyone go?}
{4091}{}{I think blood is coming out of my eyes.}
{4100}{}{So, facial tattoos, huh? I guess if I was as ugly as bone-nose, here, I'd want to cover that up too.}
{4101}{}{Yo, face-tats. You the cannibalistic sort? Maybe we could exchange recipes or something.}
{4102}{}{I get the feeling your pal Sulik here doesn't dig me too much. You ever think about selling the guy off for some cash?}
{4110}{}{Seriously, what's with the dumpy bald dude? You keeping him out of pity or something?}
{4111}{}{So Vic, I hear you've got a spunky daughter. You should introduce me to her.}
{4120}{}{Miria, honey, we really need to spend some one-on-one time together.}
{4121}{}{So I'm guessing we get to take turns with Miria, right?}
{4122}{}{[Winks at Miria.]}
{4123}{}{[Smiles at Miria.]}
{4124}{}{Miria, you need a man who's in the same league as you. You know, one like me.}
{4125}{}{[Brandishes knife at Miria. Grins.]}
{4130}{}{I say we put a hole in Davin's head and roll him into a ditch.}
{4131}{}{Let's say, hypothetically, that Davin somehow gets his throat slit in his sleep tonight. No one's gonna care, right?}
{4140}{}{Hey Cassidy, you should really try some Psycho. I heard it can even re-grow hair.}
{4141}{}{Why don't you hit that booze a little harder, Cassidy? It seems to have aged you so well.}
{4142}{}{It's pathetic to see someone as old as Cassidy trying to hold on to life. If I were in his shoes,
 I'd kiss the barrel of a shotgun and just end it.}
{4150}{}{Lets say we ditch the walking corpse.}
{4151}{}{Alright, this whole joke about bringing Lenny along has gone on a little long now, don't you think?}
{4152}{}{How the hell am I supposed to pick up the ladies with Lenny hanging around?}
{4160}{}{So, uh, Marcus, when do you revert back to the mild mannered physicist?}
{4161}{}{Hey Marcus, don't you have some kind of town you're supposed to be running?}
{4170}{}{Hang in there Myron, I'm sure someday your balls will drop.}
{4171}{}{The Dork-boy's kinda cramping my style.}
