{100}{}{You see a plump, older woman with a large nose.}
{101}{}{You see Big Nose Sally, the owner of the Bathhouse.}
{200}{}{Hello there, my name's Sally Dunton. Hmm, did you catch that?}
{201}{}{Ally Onion? Gurk?}
{202}{}{I gotta pee-ee}
{203}{}{Oog? (shaking head)}
{204}{}{Well, that's a right nice try for an idjit. But I ain't having none of your kind in here. Now,
 git out. Shoo, shoo.}
{205}{}{I know you're a tribal and all, but this is a bathhouse, not an outhouse. Git out afore I have
 you thrown out!}
{206}{}{I know my boys have taken up with some poor sorts, but you're the worst yet. I just can't
 believe that you let them down. I won't have you in my place. Now, get out.}
{210}{}{My name's Sally Dunton, but mostly they call me Big Nose Sally. I'm the owner of this here
 bathhouse. We have a whole houseful of special, attended baths for you to pick from.}
{211}{}{What kind of special, attended baths do you have here?}
{212}{}{Gee, Miss Sally, I just wanted a regular bath. You don't have a bubble bath, do you?}
{213}{}{I think I've changed my mind; I may try back later.}
{220}{}{My name's 'Big Nose' Sally Dunton and I'm the owner of this here bathhouse. I'm afraid that we just
 have girl bath attendants here. That alright with you?}
{221}{}{I'm just here for a bath.}
{222}{}{Women suit me just fine.}
{223}{}{Gee, I was really looking for a male attendant.}
{224}{}{I don't think this is what I was looking for.}
{225}{}{I'm sorry that we couldn't help you out. Come on back later, though.}
{230}{}{If you just want an unattended bath, you might try the Golden Gecko or the Buckner House. But I
 doubt that you'll find that as enjoyable.}
{231}{}{Thanks, Miss Big Nose. I'll try that instead. Good-bye.}
{232}{}{I was just kidding; I'd like a special bath.}
{240}{}{The special baths that we have available vary in cost by the amount of time that the gal spends
 with you, and any special services that you take advantage of.}
{241}{}{You mean I get to be with a real-live girl? Sign me up!}
{242}{}{I don't think I'm ready for this; I better go.}
{243}{}{I think that the appearance of the attendant better figure into the cost, too.}
{250}{}{The baths that we have available are: a Wash Cloth Hand Wipe, a brief Full Body Wash, and,
 lastly, the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Servicing, offered by the beautiful and talented Jenny,
 recently trained at the finest house in the Den.}
{251}{}{I think I can get by with the Hand Wipe; how much is that?}
{252}{}{I like the idea of a Full Body Wash; what's that going to cost?}
{253}{}{Beautiful and talented? I've got to hear more about the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Wash.}
{254}{}{I don't think I'm ready to take a bath with someone else watching; I'm going to leave.}
{255}{}{Can I mix and match the different types of baths?}
{256}{}{What about getting a discount on those baths?}
{260}{}{No, you have to choose one at a time, but you can always come back for more -- usually
 after a brief rest.}
{261}{}{Tell me the different types of bath again.}
{262}{}{If I can't make my own combinations, I don't even want a bath; I'm outta here.}
{270}{}{Well, for an attractive individual like yourself that would only cost $25.}
{271}{}{$25? That's a bargain; I'll take it.}
{272}{}{Hmm, tell me about the other types of baths again.}
{273}{}{Maybe I don't need this right now. I'm leaving.}
{280}{}{Hmm, you look as though you need a real bath first; that'll make the price $35.}
{281}{}{$35? That seems kind of steep -- but I guess I am a bit scruffy. I'll take it.}
{282}{}{What are the other choices again?}
{283}{}{Thanks, but I think I'll look elsewhere.}
{284}{}{$35 seems kind of expensive; got any cute brahmin, instead?}
{290}{}{I think any of our girls would be happy to give you a full body wash; I just better watch the
 time to make sure it's a brief one (chuckle). The Brief Full Body Wash will cost you $55.}
{291}{}{That sounds like fun. Here's my $55.}
{292}{}{Hmm, what are the other choices again?}
{293}{}{Thanks, but I think that I'll save my money for now.}
{300}{}{You could use a bit of real scrubbing; don't you tribals know about soap? Oh well, that'll cost
 you $70 for the Brief Full Body Wash... but I'm sure that you'll be happy with the results.}
{301}{}{Wow, $70! That seems like a lot. But I bet it's worth it. I'll try it.}
{302}{}{What were the other bathing options?}
{303}{}{I don't think that I want to pay for a bath after all.}
{310}{}{Well I'm sure that your Round-the--World trip Servicing with beautiful Jenny will be an
 experience that you'll savor for quite a while. A real bargain at only $125.}
{311}{}{I can't wait to enjoy Jenny's special talents. Here's my $125.}
{312}{}{Maybe I should hear about the other bath choices again.}
{313}{}{I don't think that I'll ever need $125 worth of cleaning. I'm going to leave before I get
 myself into trouble.}
{320}{}{Hmm, I don't know if Jenny will even take you in the condition that you're in. You're going to
 need a thorough, no-nonsense, scrubbing first. (To herself: I wonder if Gerda is free for that?) With
 the cost of the pre-scrubbing, the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Servicing is yours for only $185.}
{321}{}{I get both Gerda and Jenny? What a bargain! Here's my $185.}
{322}{}{Is Gerda that larger, mustachioed woman? I better hear the other choices again.}
{323}{}{I don't think that I can afford this right now. I think I'm going to leave.}
{324}{}{Gerda isn't really a woman at all, is she? I don't want to be scrubbed down by a burly
 drag-queen. I'm outta here.}
{330}{}{That's a great choice, if you don't have a lot of time or money.}
{340}{}{I think you'll really enjoy this. }
{350}{}{I think that you'll enjoy Jenny bathing you more than any bath you've ever had.}
{360}{}{We don't handle that sort of thing here. Try talking to my sons, Chuck and Buck Dunton. I
 understand that their brahmin are pretty darn popular with a certain set.}
{361}{}{You don't have enough money. Come back when you're able to pay.}
{362}{}{It seems as though your eyes are bigger than your budget. Perhaps you'd like to try a cheaper
 washing.}
{363}{}{I'm certain that one of my sons would be happy to help you out. But you might want to come back
 here afterwards; most gals that spend any time with my boys get a hankerin' to bathe themselves real
 good.}
{370}{}{Back again, huh? A lot of folks just can't seem to get clean enough.}
{371}{}{I'm just looking around this time; I don't need a bath.}
{372}{}{Tell me the types of bath that you have again.}
{373}{}{Do I get a return customer discount?}
{380}{}{Well now, it wouldn't be fair to discount any of our services. My gals are well worth what they
 charge.}
{381}{}{Well, if I can't get a discount, I'm leaving.}
{382}{}{I guess that's fair enough. Tell me what baths you have available.}
{390}{}{Before we go any further, you've gotta know that the baths are for individuals, not groups. You
 can make your own arrangements, and then your friends can do as they please on their own.}
{391}{}{Ok.}
{400}{}{We don't want your kind around here.}
