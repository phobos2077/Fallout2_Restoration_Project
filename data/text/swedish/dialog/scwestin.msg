{100}{}{You see a man dressed in fancy ranch clothes.}
{101}{}{It's Councilor Westin.}
{102}{}{Silver and turquoise rings, silver belt buckle, pistol at his side, this guy's clearly used to having money and having his own way.}
{103}{}{I'm Roger Westin and you can't come barging in here. What do you want?}
{104}{}{You again? What do you want?}
{105}{}{What do you want?}
{106}{}{Duh...}
{107}{}{Me look Vault 13. You help?}
{108}{}{I'm looking for Vault 13. Can you help me?}
{109}{}{I finished your dirty work.}
{110}{}{Bad things come. Me scare off. Moo-moos safe.}
{111}{}{About your brahmin problem -- looks like all you've got to do is post a man out there. He doesn't even have to do anything, just be there. I know it sounds weird, but it will work. You mentioned some pay?}
{112}{}{I'm here about a job.}
{113}{}{First Citizen Lynette sends her greetings. She's got something for you.}
{114}{}{Bishop sent me.}
{115}{}{Hoppsan.}
{116}{}{That all? Talk to my foreman, Felix.}
{117}{}{You don't understand. I'm here to do a job.}
{118}{}{The sheriff suggested I come talk to you personally.}
{119}{}{Fine. Be that way.}
{120}{}{I should have guessed. What did he promise you - money, drugs, or sex? It doesn't matter. You'll never see any of it.}
{121}{}{What do you mean?}
{122}{}{Shut up.}
{123}{}{Oh - simple are you? What a sad thing. It must be a hard cross to bear. Listen - you go, talk to Fee-lix. He give you job. Savvy?}
{124}{}{Aha.}
{125}{}{What do you think? You know too much. What if you come back to NCR and sell him out - or threaten to? You're as good as dead already. On the other hand, I've got a better offer.}
{126}{}{Such as?}
{127}{}{I don't believe you.}
{128}{}{Take out Bishop instead. I'll pay cash, whatever he was paying plus 50%. How much was it?}
{129}{}{(need info from Chris)}
{130}{}{(Avellone, that is)}
{131}{}{Bra.}
{132}{}{Deal.}
{133}{}{Too bad for you, old man.}
{134}{}{I look forward to hearing from you. Now, go out the way you came.}
{135}{}{Excellent. I knew you were the right person. Well, I promised you pay and I do not renege my deals. Here's your money.}
{136}{}{Anything else I can do for you?}
{137}{}{Thanks. Maybe you can help me out. I'm trying to find Vault 13.}
{138}{}{Farv√§l.}
{139}{}{Dumont recommended you? Well, that's good enough for me. Something or someone has been raiding my brahmin at night. I need to find out what's up. How about going out there and looking into it for me? I'll pay you for your trouble.}
{140}{}{Sounds like easy work. I'll do it.}
{141}{}{I've decided against it.}
{142}{}{Something or someone has been raiding my brahmin at night. I need to find out what's up. How about going out there and looking into it for me? I'll pay you for your trouble.}
{143}{}{Sounds like a good idea. I'll do it.}
{144}{}{No thanks. Sitting in a field, waiting for some mantoid to show sounds boring.}
{145}{}{Excellent. Felix will guide you out there. Now, if you'll excuse me.}
{146}{}{Well, maybe I can. I've heard a lot of stories about Tandi and the Vault Dweller. Seems he saved her life years ago before NCR was even founded. Anyway, legend has it that he spent a lot of time exploring a vault east of here. If that isn't vault 13 then maybe you'll find a clue there that will lead you to it.}
{147}{}{Ooooh. Good.}
{148}{}{Tack!}
{149}{}{Well, maybe I can. However, I need a favor from you first. Something, or someone, has been raiding my brahmin at night. I need to find out what's up. How about going out there and looking into it for me? I'll pay you for it and I'll tell you what I know.}
{150}{}{Sounds like a good idea. I'll do it.}
{151}{}{No thanks. Sitting in a field, waiting for some mantoid to show sounds boring.}
{152}{}{Well, then here you go. Nice to meet you, stranger.}
{153}{}{I'm not sure I believe you, but here's your pay. Hell, if you been lying, my boys will find you. I also said I'd give you some information, so here it is. I've heard a lot of stories about Tandi and the Vault Dweller. Seems he saved her life years ago before NCR was even founded. Anyway, legend has it that he spent a lot of time exploring a vault east of here. If that isn't Vault 13 then maybe you'll find a clue there that will lead you to it.}
{154}{}{Me tank you!}
{155}{}{Tack.}
{156}{}{The First Citizen? Excellent, this is what I've been waiting for. Are you a Vault Citizen?}
{157}{}{Ja.}
{158}{}{Nej.}
{159}{}{And you're a good Citizen, I'm sure. I want you to take this holodisk back to the 1st Citizen. It's important. It has the information she needs to expose this NCR-New Reno plan.}
{160}{}{I have some other questions.}
{161}{}{Yes, sir.}
{162}{}{Well then, that's all.}
{163}{}{I have some other questions.}
{164}{}{Hur som helst.}
{165}{}{A job. You mean--}
{166}{}{Bishop sent me. Got a little message for you.}
{167}{}{Bye-bye and sleep tight, old man.}
{168}{}{dollars it is. You do the job, I pay you. You say no, you don't get out of here alive. Well?}
{169}{}{Ohh yeah. Well, I was having some problem with varmints, but they stopped coming around. Sorry about that. Try Felix and see if he has anything for you to do.}
{170}{}{Ok, thanks.}
{171}{}{Ehhh.... I have a bad heart condition... can't take...}
{172}{}{Must ..... ttteeeelll Feeellliixx.}
{173}{}{Wow, I guess he did have a heart problem.}
{174}{}{AHHAHH!!! AHAHAHHAH!!! AHHAHAH!!! IT BURNS!!!}
{175}{}{You delivered the holodisk to Westin.}
{176}{}{His heart go boom boom.}
