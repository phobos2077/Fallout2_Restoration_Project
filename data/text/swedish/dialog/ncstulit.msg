{100}{}{You see a cute "little person."}
{101}{}{You see Stuart Little.}
{150}{}{You see a midget in children's clothes. He is chewing on a toothpick and studying you.}
{151}{}{You see Stuart Little, the midget boxing agent. He is chewing on a toothpick and studying you.}
{152}{}{You see Stuart Little, the midget boxing agent. He looks so cute. Like a smelly, red-haired teddy bear.}
{200}{}{Kid, I knew you'd do good, but I didn't know you were gonna save the world, too. Good job.}
{201}{}{You done me proud, kid.}
{202}{}{You went the distance, kid. You done Stuart proud.}
{210}{}{I wish I coulda seen you put your fist through the Enclave.}
{211}{}{That battle 'gainst the Enclave musta been something else. Damn.}
{212}{}{Ha! Ever thought of using that energy o' yours in the RING rather than savin' the world?}
{220}{}{How's it hanging, champ?}
{221}{}{Looking good, fella.}
{222}{}{Fists like gold is what you have.}
{223}{}{Ya eat lightning and crap thunder, kid.}
{224}{}{You dropped that sonuvabitch like a bad habit. Good job.}
{225}{}{Glad I took the chance on you, sweetheart.}
{226}{}{Looking good, darling.}
{230}{}{Need some new talent...}
{231}{}{Sorry lead asses...}
{232}{}{If I was just a little taller...}
{233}{}{These guys all fight like bums...}
{240}{}{(The midget studies you as you walk up and takes the toothpick out of his mouth.) }
{241}{}{Yeah, whatta YOU want, big guy?}
{242}{}{What can I do for you, honey?}
{243}{}{Hey there, hero. What can I do for you?}
{244}{}{Hunh?}
{245}{}{Why you soooo small?}
{246}{}{[Wander off.]}
{247}{}{Who are you?}
{248}{}{Nothing. I was just looking around.}
{250}{}{(Makes a shooing motion.) Buzz off, asshead. Yer wasting my time.}
{251}{}{Bzzzzzzz-bzzzzzz}
{260}{}{(Sighs, looks like he is about to say something, then pauses as he studies your frame.) You fight at all? You
 look pretty fit.}
{261}{}{Me fight a LOT. Me fight u?}
{262}{}{Me no look pretty. U like men? Me willing}
{270}{}{No, no... fight in the RING! You know, the ring? (Points at the boxing ring, makes jabbing motions in the air.)
 That something you might be interested in?}
{271}{}{(Punch the tiny man in the face and take his lunch money)}
{272}{}{Uh-huh}
{273}{}{Can I get ice cream if fight?}
{274}{}{Nuh-uh}
{275}{}{Me married to advenshure me leave}
{280}{}{(Jumps back.) Whoa there, asshead! Save it for the ring. Now look: you in or you out?}
{281}{}{I'm an innie}
{283}{}{I'm an outtie}
{290}{}{(Smiles.) All right, it's a done deal. Name's Stuart, most call me Stuart Little, but that's only cause... well, all YOU
 need to know is I'm big in all the important ways. You got a name, asshead?}
{291}{}{Jag }
{292}{}{Me... uh... me...}
{293}{}{Me Big Stu}
{296}{}{[Wander away in search of adventure.]}
{300}{}{Me-a-me, huh? "Miami..." I LIKE it. I LIKE it. All right then, let's go do some damage.}
{301}{}{(Frowns.) Wise-ass, huh? Hmmph... can't get no respect in this town. (Shrugs.) All right then, let's go do some
 damage.}
{302}{}{, huh? All right then, }
{305}{}{[Run away and hide.]}
{310}{}{(Puffs up indignantly.) Look. Just because I'm not of so-called "average height" does not mean I have to receive my thrills
 vicariously.}
{311}{}{Is that so?}
{320}{}{Get outta my sight, asshead. No hope for you in this town. Beat it!}
{321}{}{I NEVER should have taken a risk on you, what a friggin' disappointment. Now get outta here! Beat it!}
{322}{}{ME }
{323}{}{What about ice cream}
{324}{}{[Run off crying.]}
{326}{}{[Smile calmly, nod, then attack him.]}
{327}{}{Give me another chance, Stuart. Come on, just ONE more chance. I can go the distance!}
{328}{}{[Leave.]}
{329}{}{(Stuart looks disgusted with you as you're hauled out of the ring.) }
{330}{}{What, the Masticator bite your ears off, boy?! }
{331}{}{What, the Masticator bite your ears off, girl?! }
{332}{}{I said BEAT it! Get outta here!}
{333}{}{[Kick the loud red little man.]}
{334}{}{[Tromp out angrily.]}
{336}{}{[Hit the road.]}
{337}{}{(Turns red.) }
{340}{}{One more chance. I get 75%, no arguments. }
{341}{}{One more chance. I still get 75%, no arguments. }
{342}{}{Done. I'm ready to fight again right now. Lead on, Stuart.}
{343}{}{Done. Give me a little time to rest up, and I'll be ready to fight again.}
{344}{}{Nothing's worth this much grief.}
{345}{}{(Stuart turns red, looks like he is about to start shouting, then simmers down.) Awright. }
{346}{}{Screw up again, yer outta here.}
{350}{}{(Stuart is smiling like a jackal.) Damn fine performance up there, }
{351}{}{Me ready now READY TO DO SOME DAMAGE NOW NOW}
{352}{}{Me take brief nap then me ready to fight again}
{353}{}{Me want some ice cream}
{355}{}{I'm ready. Let's get down to business.}
{356}{}{Let me rest a little, then I'll be ready.}
{357}{}{I think I'm done with this, Stuart... I saw my death up there in that ring, and it has me spooked. I'm hanging up the gloves.}
{360}{}{(The midget blinks, then frowns.) Ice... what?}
{361}{}{I scream, you scream, everybody screams for ice cream}
{362}{}{Uh-uh. Ice CREAM}
{363}{}{[Wander off in search of adventure.]}
{370}{}{(The midget smiles uneasily.) }
{371}{}{Well, I can get you some cream, pal... mostly of the whore or drug variety... but that's about it. }
{372}{}{Well, I can get you some cream, honey... mostly of the male prostitute or drug variety... but that's about it. }
{373}{}{Now you wanna fight or what?}
{374}{}{Okay}
{375}{}{Me want to rest a bit first.}
{376}{}{Naw}
{380}{}{Well, I ain't gonna force you, but it could have been a sweet deal, a rocket road to the top, a jackpot in the
 sky... come back if you change your mind. You're gold, kid.}
{390}{}{All right then! Let's get this circus on the road!}
{391}{}{[Follow him.]}
{400}{}{Wha... you ain't HEARD of me? Stuart, Stuart Little? Biggest agent in all of Reno? }
{401}{}{Someone's done you a disservice not telling you about me, pal. }
{402}{}{Someone's done you a disservice not telling you about me, darling. }
{404}{}{Hmmmph. So. What's your name?}
{405}{}{Jag är}
{407}{}{You ever worked in a circus, Stuart?}
{408}{}{"Stuart Little?"}
{409}{}{There's a little more to me than my legs, Stuart. So be polite, or else you're going to have even more trouble getting
 a date in this town, all right?}
{410}{}{Actually, I was just looking around. Catch you later, Stuart.}
{411}{}{(Sticks toothpick back in mouth, chews on it.) Got a name?}
{412}{}{(Looks you up and down.) Got a name to go with those legs?}
{420}{}{(Stuart nods.) }
{421}{}{Awright, }
{422}{}{... }
{423}{}{What can I do for you?}
{424}{}{I'm looking to box. Can you help me out?}
{430}{}{(Stuart nods and smiles as you approach.) Hey, hero! Heard about what you did. Congratulations. What's up?}
{431}{}{(Stuart nods as you approach.) Heeeey, }
{432}{}{(Stuart sneers as you approach.) Well, if it ain't "}
{433}{}{Me wanta fight more}
{434}{}{Th'sky. Byeee}
{435}{}{I'm reeeeeeady to rumble.}
{436}{}{Give me another chance, Stuart. I can GO the distance! C'mon...}
{437}{}{Nothing. Just looking around.}
{440}{}{You wanna BOX? Uh... awright, let me level with you, kid. You just don't look like you
 have the frame for it.}
{441}{}{You wanna BOX? Awright, now I've heard it all. Look, most job opportunities in Reno for women are... hmmm.
 Well, from the looks of it, maybe those jobs weren't cut out for you.}
{442}{}{You wanna BOX? Awright, now I've heard it all. Look, not to be mean or nothing, it's just that boxing is an
 UGLY sport... and it makes people in it ugly, too. In your case, that would be a damn shame.}
{444}{}{Give me a chance, and I'll forget that LITTLE crack you just made.}
{445}{}{Give me a chance, Stuart.}
{446}{}{Oh, forget this brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}
{450}{}{No, sorry, honey, too much of a risk... chances are, they wouldn't even let you fight. Now get
 on home, 'kay?}
{451}{}{No, sorry, pal, too much of a risk... it'd be a massacre. Now get on home, 'kay?}
{452}{}{There aren't any woman boxers, Stuart, and that's my point. You'll be the first agent sponsoring a woman boxer. People will
 come in DROVES to see it.}
{453}{}{But that's just it, Stu... I can call you Stu, can't I?...it WOULD be a massacre. Do you know how much attention that would
 grab? It'd be like going to see an execution!}
{454}{}{Oh, this is brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}
{460}{}{No, sorry, honey, too much of a risk... chances are, they wouldn't even let you fight. Now get
 on home, 'kay?}
{461}{}{No, sorry, pal, it wouldn't even be an entertaining massacre. Now get on home, 'kay?}
{462}{}{It's a risk, sure... but you know, Stuart, I could *dress down* a little in the ring. Might draw more of a crowd than you're
 used to...}
{463}{}{Oh, this is brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}
{470}{}{Hmmmmm... awright, I'll give you a chance... but I ain't promising anything. This hurts business,
 even a little, and you're out. (Puts his hands on hips.) My take is half the winnings, no arguments.}
{471}{}{Hmmmmm... I'll give you a chance... but I ain't promising anything; I'm doing you a favor
 taking some unknown under my wing. My take is half the winnings... no arguments.}
{472}{}{Färdigt.}
{473}{}{Cut your take down to 25%, and we got a deal.}
{474}{}{Oh, this is brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}
{480}{}{(Stuart's frown deepens. He looks like he is about to protest, then he shakes his head with a smirk.) All right already!
 Now if yer ALL done whittling away my livelihood, let's talk management.}
{481}{}{Okay...}
{490}{}{Awright... (Stuart looks you over.) Yer gonna need a name, y'know, a handle. Something that sounds tough. Mean. Like }
{500}{}{(The midget frowns.) Didn't he die against that Russian guy way back when? Aw, whatever. Shall we hit the ring?}
{501}{}{(The midget smirks.) Looks like you and the "Masticator" will be getting along just fine. Just don't bite off too many
 ears. Well... shall we hit the ring?}
{502}{}{(The midget smirks.) You don't look Russian. But whatever works for you... shall we hit the ring?}
{503}{}{(The midget smirks.) "Pity the fo," huh? Well, okay... but let's hope YOUR career goes somewhere. Shall we head to the ring?}
{504}{}{(The midget smirks.) Eye of the Tiger, huh? "Aaaydrian," "Aaaaydrian..." Heh-heh. I like it... lot of weight associated with it.
 Shall we head to the ring?}
{505}{}{(The midget nods.) }
{506}{}{Let's do it.}
{510}{}{No dice. Fifty-fifty or NOTHING. If you don't like that, walk.}
{511}{}{Fine. Though I wasn't aware vampires came in your size.}
{512}{}{Okay. 50/50. What's next?}
{513}{}{Did I say 25/75? I MEANT 50/50. We'll split the profit right down the middle. No problems here.}
{514}{}{[Walk.]}
{520}{}{Yeah, yeah, I know, "Stuart Little." My Mom used to read a lotta E.B. White. Now, you got a name?}
{521}{}{Hmmpph. You got a name?}
{526}{}{Nice meeting you, Stu. I don't have time to talk right now. Catch you later.}
{530}{}{And what makes you think I've ever spectated a circus, much less been enslaved by one?}
{531}{}{Uh... well, I know that many of the citizens of New Reno act like they came out of a circus, and I thought...}
{540}{}{YOU thought because I'm a person of short stature, the only career I could procure would be confined to the so-called 'big top.'}
{541}{}{Uh... well, now...}
{550}{}{You took one QUICK look at me and thought you could deduce my entire life. It would never have occurred to you that a
 person of my height could have obtained a career in *Boxing Management.*}
{551}{}{I'm sorry, I meant no offense.}
{560}{}{Why should I take offense? Just because it seems to be the habit of everyone in this game to make instantaneous judgments
 of other NPCs based solely on their physical appearance?}
{561}{}{Well, I don't know about an INSTANTANEOUS judgment...}
{570}{}{Why, I've done the same thing to you, for example.}
{571}{}{Oh?}
{580}{}{(Looks at you pityingly.) But do you see the TRAGEDY here? I have mistakenly reduced you to a stereotype, a caricature,
 a generic Fallout model, instead of regarding you as a specific, unique character.}
{581}{}{Uh, but Stuart, I AM a typical hero model. In fact, I am the player character of this game.}
{590}{}{Not all women are attracted to barrel-chested, overly muscled male character models. You'd be surprised how many women
 find my size intriguingly ALLURING.}
{591}{}{And you'd be surprised how many men do as well.}
{600}{}{I've taken in your ridiculously overly-muscled physique, your gritty Mad Maxx wanna-be demeanor, your unimaginative
 character point allocation and concluded you are a mini-maxing munchkin.}
{601}{}{I've taken in your over-pixilated breasts, your ridiculous sashay when you walk, your unimaginative character point
 allocation and concluded you are a mini-maxing Laura Kroft wannabe... a "munchkin."}
{602}{}{I...}
{610}{}{You are nothing more than a typical 'RPG male hero model,' if you will, one of MANY such models that seems to fill this
 world in droves.}
{611}{}{You are nothing more than a typical 'RPG female hero model,' if you will, one of MANY such models that seems to fill this
 world in droves.}
{612}{}{Tja...}
{1302}{}{ let's go do some damage.}
{1322}{}{ NOT ASS HEAD ME KILL YOU KILL YOU KILL Y--}
{1350}{}{...you doing all right, feeling all right? Let me know when you're ready for your next match.}
{1405}{}{.}
{1406}{}{, I'm looking to box. Can you help me out?}
{1421}{}{. Nice ta meet ya. }
{1422}{}{... I like that. Pretty name. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, }
{1431}{}{! What's up? Ready to get back in the ring?}
{1432}{}{." What brings you back around?}
{1490}{}{ the Hurricane, }
{2490}{}{ the Brawler, y'know.}
{2505}{}{... not bad, not bad. It fits. (Nods at the ring.) Shall we get to it, then? You ready?}
{3422}{}{. }
