{1004}{}{By doath! Dew tore off by doath!}
{1005}{}{I've been scalped!}
{1006}{}{My face is gone, oh God nooooo!}
{1007}{}{Where's my ear?}

{1009}{}{No one will ever be able to look at me again!}
{1010}{}{Ow, my arm!}
{1011}{}{Aj!}
{1012}{}{You broke my arm!}
{1013}{}{Christ, my arm's been torn off!}
{1014}{}{Oh God, not my arm.}
{1015}{}{Stop, please stop.}
{1016}{}{(Sob, sob)}

{1020}{}{Ow, my arm!}
{1021}{}{Wahhhh!}
{1022}{}{My God! My arm!}
{1023}{}{How can I support my family now?}

{1026}{}{Christ, just make the pain stop!}
{1027}{}{Not my fingers, anything but that. Noooooo!}

{1040}{}{I'm a gonner.}
{1041}{}{Christ, why did you have to do that?}
{1042}{}{Who'll take care of my family?}
{1043}{}{Why me? Why?}
{1044}{}{What did I ever do to you?}
{1045}{}{I never wanted to die like this.}
{1046}{}{I didn't mean nothin'. Just don't kill me.}
{1047}{}{Arrrgh, my spine!}
{1048}{}{W'wait, where's my spleen?}
{1049}{}{So much, blood.}
{1050}{}{I'm starting to feel cold and sleepy.}

{1076}{}{Bone, so white, pain, so great...}
{1077}{}{So much blood... it's everywhere.}
{1078}{}{I've been torn open.}

{1095}{}{The pain, the pain...}
{1096}{}{And I wanted a family too.}
{1097}{}{Now I'll never have more kids.}
{1098}{}{Why there? Why?}
{1099}{}{It burns, it burns.}
{1100}{}{I think I need to sit down.}

{1107}{}{Who turned out the lights?}
{1108}{}{Do smathed by teef out!}
{1109}{}{Hey, I part my hair on the *other* side.}
{1110}{}{Hah, at least you didn't hit anything important.}
{1111}{}{Oooh, my head.}
{1112}{}{I feel kinda dizzy.}
{1113}{}{Aggghhh! My arm!}
{1114}{}{My arm!}
{1115}{}{Oh man, that hurts!}
{1116}{}{My arm hurts, it's a bad one.}
{1117}{}{My arm's all tore up.}
{1118}{}{My arm's broken, here... and here....}
{1119}{}{Bone sticking out of arm, arrrrrgghhh.}
{1120}{}{I can't feel anything, my arm's all numb.}

{1122}{}{My thumb's been ripped right off my hand!}
{1123}{}{Aggghhh! My arm!}
{1124}{}{My arm!}
{1125}{}{My hand's almost torn off!}
{1126}{}{Arrrrgh! Help me find my fingers!}
{1127}{}{I'll never write that novel now.}
{1128}{}{My arm's broken!}
{1129}{}{Unh, you tore my arm backwards.}
{1130}{}{Holy Christ! I didn't think I could feel this much pain.}
{1131}{}{Not the arm, why my arm?}
{1132}{}{It hurts so bad.}
{1133}{}{My legs, I can't feel my legs.}
{1134}{}{Oof!}
{1135}{}{Ouch!}
{1136}{}{Oof! My ribs hurt}
{1137}{}{Ugh! That hurt!}
{1138}{}{Damn! I spit on you!}
{1139}{}{Argh!}
{1140}{}{Oh, my ribs!}
{1141}{}{Ow!!!}
{1142}{}{Oof!}
{1143}{}{If it don't hurt much is it a bad one?}
{1144}{}{Heavy weight on chest, gasp, gasp, so thirsty.}
{1145}{}{*Gasp* Why can't I breathe right?}
{1146}{}{It hurts real bad.}
{1147}{}{I think something's broken inside, I hurt real bad.}
{1148}{}{Ack! Something tore loose inside my chest.}
{1149}{}{Why's it have to hurt so damn much?}
{1150}{}{Oh Christ, not a gut wound!}
{1151}{}{I just keep bleeding, it won't (cough, cough) stop.}
{1152}{}{I can't breathe and I keep coughin' up blood, that's bad ain't it?}
{1153}{}{I've got a hole all the way through me.}
{1154}{}{I can see my insides, uh oh.}
{1155}{}{My insides are on the outside, that can't be good.}
{1156}{}{My lungs keep hissing and (cough, cough, gasp) burbling.}
{1157}{}{I'm feeling kinda warm and sleepy now.}
{1158}{}{I think I just want to lay down for a while.}
{1159}{}{It's getting so dark now.}
{1160}{}{Aggghhh! My leg!}
{1161}{}{My leg!}
{1162}{}{There goes my knee!}
{1163}{}{My dance career's over.}
{1164}{}{My kneecap's just gone man, gone.}
{1165}{}{Where's the lower half of my leg? Where is it?!?}
{1166}{}{It hurts to move.}
{1167}{}{I've been hit. I can't feel my leg.}
{1168}{}{It hurts, somebody make it stop!}
{1169}{}{The pain! Oh, the pain!}
{1170}{}{Aggghhh! My leg!}
{1171}{}{My leg!}
{1172}{}{There goes my knee!}
{1173}{}{I can't feel my leg at all.}
{1174}{}{I guess I better find myself a parrot and an eyepatch.}
{1175}{}{Just call me stumpy.}
{1176}{}{I'll never be able to support my family now.}
{1177}{}{Who'll hire me now?}
{1178}{}{I'm no good to anyone as a cripple. (sob, sob)}
{1179}{}{My leg, I can't feel it.}
{1180}{}{Aggghhh! I'm blind!}
{1181}{}{My eyes! My eyes!}
{1182}{}{My eye! You'll pay for that one!}
{1183}{}{You tore my eye out.}
{1184}{}{Who turned out the lights?}
{1185}{}{My eye! Aiiieeeee!}
{1186}{}{I sure wish I could see just one more sunset.}
{1187}{}{My eye, I can't see anything!}
{1188}{}{It's so dark, and lonely all of a sudden.}
{1189}{}{I'd give anything to see again.}
{1190}{}{Oooooo, my groin!}
{1191}{}{Oooooooooo!}
{1192}{}{I... can't... breathe...}
{1193}{}{Erg! Right in the jewels!}
{1194}{}{The pain, the pain...}
{1195}{}{Damn, that hurts!}
{1196}{}{No more kids for me.}
{1197}{}{*unh* low blow.}
{1198}{}{Eeeeeep!}
{1199}{}{Oh yeah, that hurts.}
{1200}{}{Ow! You son of a...}
{1201}{}{You broke my nose!}
{1202}{}{I'll take your head off!}
{1203}{}{You hit my fuckin' skull!}
{1204}{}{Gotta try harder than that, but not much harder.}
{1205}{}{Ouch, that's going to cost you.}
{1206}{}{Oh, look at all the pretty birdies.}
{1207}{}{That hurt.}
{1208}{}{You fucked up my pretty face.}
{1209}{}{That's going to leave a scar.}
{1210}{}{Ow, my arm.}
{1211}{}{You just made the biggest mistake of your life.}
{1212}{}{My arm!}
{1213}{}{Hah, I'm right handed.}
{1214}{}{Only need one arm to kill you.}
{1215}{}{I don't need those fingers anyway.}
{1216}{}{I only need one finger for you bub.}
{1217}{}{Damn, that's gonna take away from my swing.}
{1218}{}{I can still take you out of the picture.}
{1219}{}{Damn, snapped my arm right in two.}
{1220}{}{Ow, my arm.}
{1221}{}{You just made the biggest mistake of your life.}
{1222}{}{My arm!}
{1223}{}{I can take you left handed.}
{1224}{}{Hah, I'm a southpaw anyhow.}
{1225}{}{Trying to disarm me huh?}
{1226}{}{That's not going to stop me.}
{1227}{}{I've still got another hand to use against you.}
{1228}{}{Damn, that hurt.}
{1229}{}{Mmm, that's going to leave a mark.}
{1230}{}{Urp!}
{1231}{}{Oof!}
{1232}{}{Ouch!}
{1233}{}{Yup, that cracked some ribs alright.}
{1234}{}{Ugh! That hurt!}
{1235}{}{Ouch!}
{1236}{}{Argh!}
{1237}{}{Oh, I think you broke a rib!}
{1238}{}{Ow!!! My spleen!}
{1239}{}{Yeah, that just got me started.}
{1240}{}{Now you've got me pissed off.}
{1241}{}{I didn't like that at all.}
{1242}{}{Damn, you popped a goddamn lung.}
{1243}{}{Only a worm like you would try for a gut-wound.}
{1244}{}{I'm going to replace those organs you just holed, with some of yours.}
{1245}{}{Damn, you're better than you look, 'spose you'd hafta be.}
{1246}{}{That's not nice at all. I'm going to have to teach you some manners.}
{1247}{}{Lucky shot that time.}
{1248}{}{Hope you think it's just as funny when I do that to you.}
{1249}{}{I must be getting old. That actually hurt.}
{1250}{}{You'll have to do a lot better than that.}
{1251}{}{Everything's still workin' well enough to take you out.}
{1252}{}{Just missed my lung, I think.}
{1253}{}{I sure do have a lot of blood in me, well, I used to anyway.}
{1254}{}{Goddamn that hurts!}
{1255}{}{Fuck! You bastard!}
{1256}{}{Nobody hits me like that, and lives.}
{1257}{}{Soon as I catch my breath (cough, cough) I'm coming for you.}
{1258}{}{You tore something up inside me.}
{1259}{}{You don't know what you just started.}
{1260}{}{Ow, my leg.}
{1261}{}{I don't need to stand to kill you!}
{1262}{}{My knee!}
{1263}{}{My achilles tendon!}
{1264}{}{Aaiiiieeee!!}
{1265}{}{There goes my foxtrot.}
{1266}{}{I'll teach you to tear my toes off.}
{1267}{}{Break my leg? I'll tear you apart!}
{1268}{}{Where's a tourniquet when you need one.}
{1269}{}{Fuck, my leg hurts.}
{1270}{}{Ow, my leg.}
{1271}{}{I don't need to stand to kill you!}
{1272}{}{My knee!}
{1273}{}{That's going to give me a nice limp for a while.}
{1274}{}{Come here, don't make me hobble after you.}
{1275}{}{Damn near tore my leg off.}
{1276}{}{That's going to slow me up for the whole season.}
{1277}{}{That'll bench me for sure.}
{1278}{}{I've got another leg.}
{1279}{}{Hah-hah, that was my prosthetic leg anyhow.}
{1280}{}{I can't see!}
{1281}{}{This fight is getting worse by the second.}
{1282}{}{That was a real cheap shot!}
{1283}{}{I'm fuckin' blind here!}
{1284}{}{You prick, you blinded me!}
{1285}{}{Just for that, I'm going to pop your eyes like ripe grapes.}
{1286}{}{You tore my fucking eye out!}
{1287}{}{Crap, my eye's dangling by the optic nerve here.}
{1288}{}{I can still hear where you are.}
{1289}{}{Don't you ever touch my fucking eyes again!}
{1290}{}{Oooooo, my groin!}
{1291}{}{I'll feel that in the morning.}
{1292}{}{Fucking coward!}
{1293}{}{Urp!}
{1294}{}{That won't help you any.}
{1295}{}{Figures that you'd try that.}
{1296}{}{Gettin' your jollies?}
{1297}{}{I'm gonna tear yours off and make you eat them.}
{1298}{}{I think I need to sit down for a while.}
{1299}{}{Got to try harder than that, my cup caught most of it.}
{1300}{}{That'll be a cool scar!}
{1301}{}{I'm starting to get annoyed.}
{1302}{}{Do that again, pig.}
{1303}{}{That just makes me mad.}
{1304}{}{That ringing sound I hear is your death-knell.}
{1305}{}{One more scar won't make me any uglier.}
{1306}{}{I didn't even feel that one.}
{1307}{}{At least you only hit my head.}
{1308}{}{Youch, that hurt, a little.}
{1309}{}{I still have *some* teeth left.}
{1310}{}{You winged me!}
{1311}{}{I can take you one-handed.}
{1312}{}{You broke my arm, but I'll break your neck!}
{1313}{}{You can't stop me that easy.}
{1314}{}{That was just my left arm.}
{1315}{}{I can still take care of little problems like you.}
{1316}{}{Damn, you got my left arm.}
{1317}{}{Took out my elbow!}
{1318}{}{Crap, there go a couple more fingers.}
{1319}{}{You take my finger, I'll take your Goddamn hand.}
{1320}{}{I can take you left-handed.}
{1321}{}{It's just a scratch...}
{1322}{}{You broke my arm, so I'm gonna break your neck.}
{1323}{}{I only need one arm to take you out.}
{1324}{}{Took off another finger. That hurt.}
{1325}{}{I don't need that arm anyway.}
{1326}{}{That's more than a scratch.}
{1327}{}{Goddamn that hurt.}
{1328}{}{That'll need stitches.}
{1329}{}{I'll tear out your liver for that.}
{1330}{}{A little blood ain't hurt no-one.}
{1331}{}{Oof! I'm gonna scrag you for that...}
{1332}{}{Aj!}
{1333}{}{I like the pain!}
{1334}{}{I love the sound of cracking ribs!}
{1335}{}{That ain't nothing!}
{1336}{}{Argh!}
{1337}{}{Yeah, bring it on.}
{1338}{}{That the best you can do?}
{1339}{}{You hit like a baby-girl.}
{1340}{}{And I thought this was a fight.}
{1341}{}{That'll take hours to slow me up.}
{1342}{}{Ouch, just a few ribs more or less.}
{1343}{}{I don't even slow down for gut wounds.}
{1344}{}{That got my interest.}
{1345}{}{I'll make sure that hurts you more'n it did me.}
{1346}{}{You stupid bastard. Now I'll kill you slow.}
{1347}{}{That hurt, a little.}
{1348}{}{Blood just makes me angry.}
{1349}{}{Just a scratch, I've had worse.}
{1350}{}{That barely gouged me.}
{1351}{}{Thanks, my back feels much better now.}
{1352}{}{I hope that was your best shot, you won't get another.}
{1353}{}{OK, now it's my turn.}
{1354}{}{Damn, that almost hurt.}
{1355}{}{Hey, that stings a bit.}
{1356}{}{Damn, that burns a little.}
{1357}{}{I'll have time to patch this up, when you're dead.}
{1358}{}{I've had worse.}
{1359}{}{Let's see how you like that.}
{1360}{}{I love the sound of bones crunching.}
{1361}{}{I'll get you if I have to crawl after you.}
{1362}{}{You broke my leg, but I'll break your neck!}
{1363}{}{Shit! I can't feel my leg.}
{1364}{}{A limp isn't going to stop me.}
{1365}{}{Ripped my fucking leg open, you bastard!}
{1366}{}{That coulda' been worse.}
{1367}{}{Let's talk about revenge now.}
{1368}{}{That leg didn't work too good anyhow.}
{1369}{}{Talk about a hot-foot.}
{1370}{}{I love the sound of bones crunching.}
{1371}{}{I still have one leg left.}
{1372}{}{You broke my leg, but I'll break your neck!}
{1373}{}{I was never much of a dancer anyhow.}
{1374}{}{Well, I guess I'll never be a Rockette now.}
{1375}{}{That's gonna cost you *both* legs.}
{1376}{}{I can take worse than that.}
{1377}{}{I'm going to tear your leg off with my teeth.}
{1378}{}{Damn, you took my toes off.}
{1379}{}{Just call me stumpy.}
{1380}{}{Hey, I'm blind.}
{1381}{}{I can't see. That'll make this fair.}
{1382}{}{My eyes, bitch!}
{1383}{}{I can still hear you.}
{1384}{}{You fucking pansy.}
{1385}{}{I can't see you but I can still kill you.}
{1386}{}{You'll pay for that one.}
{1387}{}{You fucked up my Goddamn eyes!}
{1388}{}{Fuck! What happened to the lights?}
{1389}{}{My fucking eyes are on fire!}
{1390}{}{Oof, my groin!}
{1391}{}{That was a ballsy move.}
{1392}{}{Heh, heh, can't hurt that, it's brass-plated.}
{1393}{}{Whatta fuckin' sissy you are.}
{1394}{}{So, that's the way you want to play it?}
{1395}{}{Ack!}
{1396}{}{You cretin, I'm gonna neuter you.}
{1397}{}{Fuck, that hurts.}
{1398}{}{That burns, a little.}
{1399}{}{You better run after that one.}

{1521}{}{Is your aim that bad?}
{1522}{}{I only need one hand to kill you.}
{1523}{}{I didn't need that many fingers anyway.}
{1524}{}{For that, I kill you slow.}
{1525}{}{I will take both your arms for that.}
{1526}{}{You take my arm, I'll take your head!}
{1527}{}{You seek to cripple me?}
{1528}{}{I will dine on your entrails for that.}
{1529}{}{You will take a long time to die.}
{1530}{}{Awwwwwg!}
{1531}{}{My insides burn!}
{1532}{}{My guts are on fire!}
{1533}{}{My life-spirits flee from me.}
{1534}{}{I've been torn open!}
{1535}{}{May I live long enough to finish you.}
{1536}{}{Ancestors, I am coming.}
{1537}{}{I will never see the village again.}
{1538}{}{At least I will die with honor.}
{1539}{}{My brothers shall avenge me.}
{1540}{}{I have no breath left in me.}
{1541}{}{You have taken my soul.}
{1542}{}{You would mutilate me?}
{1543}{}{I'm gutted like a brahmin.}
{1544}{}{I don't feel good.}
{1545}{}{I can't feel my legs.}
{1546}{}{Suddenly, I feel warm and sleepy.}
{1547}{}{Errrggggg!}
{1548}{}{Gack! cough, cough.}
{1549}{}{Must continue, must slay enemy....}
{1550}{}{The darkness beckons to me.}
{1551}{}{The hour of my death approaches.}
{1552}{}{The Shaman was right, I do not return.}
{1553}{}{The outworlder has slain me.}
{1554}{}{I am killed.}
{1555}{}{My guts are loosened from my spine!}
{1556}{}{Do not let me shame myself in death.}
{1557}{}{Damn these pesky intestines.}
{1558}{}{Hey, look here, I can see my lunch.}
{1559}{}{Where has all the air gone?}
{1560}{}{I will crawl to kill you.}
{1561}{}{Must keep standing, must....}
{1562}{}{Do not make me run to catch you!}
{1563}{}{You would cripple me, coward!}

{1573}{}{You would cripple me, coward!}
{1574}{}{Awwwwgg!}
{1575}{}{Bone? So white....}
{1576}{}{Can't walk. Oh the pain....}
{1577}{}{I will burn off your foot for that.}
{1578}{}{Ooooo-ouuuuch!}
{1579}{}{Leg burns like fire.}
{1580}{}{The darkness is here.}
{1581}{}{Where are you?}
{1582}{}{Help, help me.}
{1583}{}{I can still hear you.}
{1584}{}{Seeking to blind me? You coward!}
{1585}{}{My sight has been stolen.}
{1586}{}{You can take my eyes but not my courage!}
{1587}{}{Come here so I can kill you!}
{1588}{}{The darkness, the darkness, Aaaiiiieee!}

{1594}{}{Gasp... can't breath....}
{1595}{}{In high, squeaky, voice--Ouch!}
{1596}{}{Unnhhh. I need to sit down for a bit.}
{1597}{}{You bastard--I kill you slow for that.}
{1598}{}{You know nothing of honor.}

{2231}{}{Time to tango!}
{2232}{}{I think I'll kill you slow.}
{2233}{}{I'm going to like seeing your guts spread out on the ground.}
{2234}{}{I wonder how much noise you'll make when I bleed you.}
{2235}{}{Welcome to the major leagues, rookie.}

{32846}{}{Sully not our sanctum!}
{32847}{}{This is for AHS-9!}

{33022}{}{Your impurity shines!}
{33023}{}{If only you had taken the oaths...}
{33024}{}{The Star Father will strike you down.}
{33025}{}{You will never see planet Quetzel.}
{33026}{}{You are a traitor to humanity's evolution.}

{33104}{}{I don't make the decisions!}
{33105}{}{I'm not the one you want!}
{33120}{}{I'd rather not do this...}
{33121}{}{Are you sure you wouldn't rather give up?}
{33122}{}{We can work this out, can't we?}
{33123}{}{If AHS-9 says you're bad, you must be bad.}
{33124}{}{For ... um... the glory of Hubbell!}
{33125}{}{Fighting is bad for your anodynes...}
{33126}{}{I'm no good at this threatening stuff.}

{40902}{}{Next time for you, you sonuvabitch...}
{40903}{}{Next time I'm packing a goddamn rocket launcher... and more stims.}
{40904}{}{If I was just twenty years younger, I coulda made it through this fight...}
{40905}{}{Bastards really working me over...}
{40906}{}{Thought that damn yellow streak of mine had faded...}
{40907}{}{True grit is knowing when to haul ass.}
{40908}{}{Gotta know when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em, and when to run away.}
{40909}{}{Gotta get to some cover...}
{40910}{}{Wait 'til I get my second wind...}
{40911}{}{Goddamn old war wound's opened up again...}
{40912}{}{Sorry, friend, I can't take much more of this...}
{40920}{}{You got about ten seconds to surrender...}
{40921}{}{Seems we're always getting into one scrap after another...}
{40922}{}{Time to correct another mistake of mother nature...}
{40923}{}{The bomb shoulda weeded all you trash out...}
{40924}{}{I'm gonna beat your sorry ass into oblivion.}
{40925}{}{Dirty sonuvabitch...}
{40926}{}{*Huf*...I...*Huf*...need more...*Huf*.... action points.}
{40927}{}{You're gonna be a long time dying...}
{40928}{}{You're one dead sonuvabitch to pick a fight with us...}
{40929}{}{Time for Cassidy to show you how we do things in the big city...}
{40940}{}{Wish I had a limit break...}
{40941}{}{Gonna knock out your teeth and use 'em as dice...}
{40942}{}{Nothing wrong with you a critical to the eyes won't cure.}
{40943}{}{Gonna kill you, then kill you again...}
{40944}{}{I got your number, you little cocksucker...}
{40945}{}{You're a stubborn one...}
{40946}{}{Yellow-gut summabitch...}
{40947}{}{You ain't got the sand to take me down...}
{40948}{}{Gonna whale the holy, howling tar outta you...}
{40949}{}{Ain't used to someone who fights back, are you?}
{40950}{}{Nothing like breaking bones to make a man feel alive...}
{40951}{}{Don't worry, I'll comfort your widow when you're gone...}
{40952}{}{Looks like you could profit from a beating or two...}
{40953}{}{Time to put you out of your misery...}
{40954}{}{Time to do a little genetic weeding...}
{40955}{}{Hope you got your grave all picked out...}
{40956}{}{If you're looking to die, you came to the right place.}
{40957}{}{Gonna grind you into a thin red paste...}
{40958}{}{I'm gonna reduce you to an undertaker's nightmare.}
{40959}{}{Gonna blast you into ground round...}
{40960}{}{Looks like your bark is worse than your bite...}
{40961}{}{Not today, friend.}
{40962}{}{You're slower than a dead turtle.}
{40963}{}{Sand in your eyes?}
{40964}{}{You aim to please. I shoot to kill.}
{40965}{}{You ain't got the sand to take me down.}
{40966}{}{Looks like you're stupid AND blind.}
{40967}{}{Missed me by a few percentage points.}
{40968}{}{You must be one wall-eyed sonuvabitch}
{40969}{}{Yer aim's off. Next turn, it's gonna be your head.}
{40970}{}{Hell, I'm a fossil, an' I can hit better than you.}
{40971}{}{Too bad YOU can't reload the game and try again...}
{40972}{}{That woulda connected if you had some skill.}
{40973}{}{Some advice: Next time, hit the target you're aiming at.}
{40974}{}{Close one...}
{40975}{}{Close one, but no cigar.}
{40976}{}{You ain't gonna get a second chance.}
{40977}{}{Slow ass sonuvabitch...}
{40978}{}{Looks like Cassidy's gonna have to show you how we do things in the big city.}
{40979}{}{Looks like you need to lay off the sauce before gettin' inta combat.}
{41200}{}{My brains hurt.}
{41201}{}{Dare goath by doath!}
{41202}{}{You hurt my ass-neck.}
{41203}{}{I see stars.}
{41204}{}{Oh dear, I think I lost more hair.}
{41205}{}{That crunch couldn't have been good.}
{41206}{}{Just a little more off the top.}
{41207}{}{You crunched my face!}
{41208}{}{Have a piece of my mind.}
{41209}{}{Uh oh. I can't remember anything.}
{41210}{}{My breaststroke's never going to be the same.}
{41211}{}{Hah, hah. Wrong arm, ya' putz!}
{41212}{}{Ack! That hurt.}
{41213}{}{Medic! Oh, that's me. Heh, heh.}
{41214}{}{That hand was going bad anyhow.}
{41215}{}{Youch!}
{41216}{}{You disarmed me!}
{41217}{}{I only need one finger for you.}
{41218}{}{There goes my thumb!}
{41219}{}{That skin was starting to rot anyway.}
{41220}{}{That's really going to affect my swing.}
{41221}{}{Jeepers that hurt!}
{41222}{}{You disarmed me!}
{41223}{}{There goes my game of eight-ball.}
{41224}{}{That's gonna kill me on the court.}
{41225}{}{No more fastball for me.}
{41226}{}{You broke my brittle bones!}
{41227}{}{That crunching sound isn't good.}
{41228}{}{I really like my elbow the way it was.}
{41229}{}{Damn, there go some fingers.}
{41230}{}{Medic! I need a... Oh, that's me. Oops.}
{41231}{}{I've got ribs.}
{41232}{}{Arrrg! My spleen!}
{41233}{}{There goes my gall bladder!}
{41234}{}{Heh heh... went right through me... didn't feel a thing.}
{41235}{}{Physician heal thyself.}
{41236}{}{Uh oh, that's a bad one.}
{41237}{}{Hey, we've got a bleeder, and it's me!}
{41238}{}{Anyone wanna see some anatomy?}
{41239}{}{Nothing trims you down like a disembowelment.}
{41240}{}{To understand life, you must fuck death... in the gallbladder.}
{41241}{}{Arrrrrrgh! My spine.}
{41242}{}{That's one way to lose ugly pounds and inches.}
{41243}{}{My legs, I can't feel my legs!}
{41244}{}{It's getting so cold all of a sudden.}
{41245}{}{Not another damn scar.}
{41246}{}{Like I really needed *that* flensing.}
{41247}{}{Now, I'll have to patch my skin again.}
{41248}{}{If my vital organs weren't already preserved in a jar that woulda hurt.}
{41249}{}{I outa wrap that with clothe before flies get in there.}
{41250}{}{Shit! I've got termites!}
{41251}{}{I had no idea that I was so dry and brittle.}
{41252}{}{Damn, anyone got some duct-tape?}
{41253}{}{(Cough, cough, wheeeeeeeeze)}
{41254}{}{Entry wound, exit wound, collect the hole set!}
{41255}{}{Damn, I've been filleted.}
{41256}{}{That was my bad side anyway.}
{41257}{}{You cut my nipple off!}
{41258}{}{No thanks, I've already shaved there.}
{41259}{}{Even better than liposuction!}
{41260}{}{That leg was going bad anyhow.}
{41261}{}{Just call me stumpy.}
{41262}{}{Just need a parrot and an eye-patch now.}
{41263}{}{Gee, it feels as though it's still attached.}
{41264}{}{Just call me gimpy.}
{41265}{}{I don't need those toes anyhow.}
{41266}{}{No more line dancing for this old ghoul.}
{41267}{}{Shattered just like dry-rotted wood.}
{41268}{}{I wonder if I can reattach that somehow.}
{41269}{}{Not my blue suede shoes!}
{41270}{}{No more Mr. Hustle.}
{41271}{}{That shin was starting to dry-rot anyway.}
{41272}{}{Thanks for taking care of that for me, it was gangrenous.}
{41273}{}{Hey, that makes me the gimp.}
{41274}{}{There goes my electric hustle.}
{41275}{}{Anyone got a board and some nails to hammer this back together?}
{41276}{}{Who needs kneecaps anyway?}
{41277}{}{There go my toes!}
{41278}{}{Ouch, shin-splint!}
{41279}{}{I can't feel my toes!}
{41280}{}{Guess I'll need an eyepatch-just call me Nick Dangerous.}
{41281}{}{Arrrr, matey, brings a tear to me one good eye.}
{41282}{}{Eye, yai, my, eye!}
{41283}{}{Who turned out the lights?}
{41284}{}{I've got my eye on you, uh, can I have it back now?}
{41285}{}{I can still find you with my super-hearing.}
{41286}{}{Hah, that was my glass-eye!}
{41287}{}{Eye'll get you for that.}
{41288}{}{Mother? It's getting dark.}
{41289}{}{Eye've had it with you!}
{41290}{}{If there were any ghoul gals, I'd be upset with you.}
{41291}{}{No more writing my name in the snow.}
{41292}{}{Chopped nuts anyone?}
{41293}{}{I'd never sing Bass anyway.}
{41294}{}{Oy-vey!}
{41295}{}{Mazel tov!}
{41296}{}{I kind of liked being a gentile.}
{41297}{}{Like *that's* going to cramp my style.}
{41298}{}{From a bull to a steer in one blow.}
{41299}{}{I feel like I should be guarding a harem now.}
{41300}{}{Uh oh, my spidey-sense is tingling.}
{41301}{}{Damn, they've got kryptonite. I'm out of here.}
{41302}{}{No one told me it would be dangerous!}
{41303}{}{What do you mean they're armed!?}
{41304}{}{Run awaaaaaay!}
{41305}{}{Run for it!}
{41306}{}{Incoming!!!!!!}
{41307}{}{My super-powers are useless against this foe!}
{41308}{}{Uh, I've got to talk to a man about a horse.}
{41309}{}{I'll be right back. Don't wait up.}
{41310}{}{No, no, no. You go ahead. I'll catch up-later.}
{41311}{}{I'm late for my root-canal. See you later.}
{41312}{}{And then we get inside the giant rabbit and....}
{41313}{}{Jesus Christ! Run for it!!!!!}
{41314}{}{For the love of God, get me out of here!}
{41315}{}{Just let me live through this one.}
{41316}{}{Oh, please, please, please, please.}
{41317}{}{Feets don't fail me now!}
{41318}{}{I'm gonna make like a shepherd and get the flock out of here!}
{41319}{}{I'm makin' like a banana and splittin'!}
{41320}{}{I've got a bad feeling about this.}
{41321}{}{My spidey-sense is definitely tingling.}
{41322}{}{It's only a rabbit.}
{41323}{}{It's got teeth how many inches long?}
{41324}{}{Yeah, they've gotta be scared now.}

{41329}{}{I'm not sure that this is such a great idea.}
{41330}{}{You go first, I'll watch the rear.}
{41331}{}{I don't know, it seems kinda dangerous.}
{41332}{}{Are you sure this is really necessary?}
{41333}{}{Well, if this is the only way.}
{41334}{}{I just don't think I'm cut out for this.}
{41335}{}{Hey, a fella could get hurt doin' this, ya'know.}
{41336}{}{Isn't there another way to resolve this?}
{41337}{}{Can't we all just get along?}
{41338}{}{Someone's going to get hurt, probably me.}
{41339}{}{Tell, me when I have to open my eyes.}

{44929}{}{I'm heading in!}
{44930}{}{I'll see you on the front line!}
{44931}{}{Time to reach out and touch someone!}
{44932}{}{Advance and annihilate!}
{44933}{}{I'm going to fall on you like ugly on a human!}
{44934}{}{Time to get physical!}
{44935}{}{Getting up close and personal.}
{44936}{}{Bad ass moving in!}
{44937}{}{Incoming!}
{44938}{}{Locked on target and homing!}
{44939}{}{There's a storm coming!}
{44940}{}{I'm going to hurt you... bad!}
{44941}{}{This is going to hurt you a lot more than it does me!}
{44942}{}{Do unto others before they do unto you!}
{44943}{}{If there's a part of you that doesn't hurt, it's next!}
{44944}{}{Contact sports. I love it!}
{44945}{}{Tell me your name so I can contact your next of kin.}
{44946}{}{I'm the one who put the 'death' in deathclaw!}
{44947}{}{It's better to give than to receive!}
{44948}{}{I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am!}
{44949}{}{Did that hurt? If not I can do it harder next time.}
{44950}{}{We have a bleeder over here!}
{44951}{}{It'll take more than a stimpak to fix you when I'm done.}
{44952}{}{I hope you have medical insurance. You're going to need it.}
{44953}{}{Here a rip, there a rip, everywhere a rip rip...}
{44954}{}{I don't care who started it, I intend to finish it!}
{44955}{}{I love the sound of tearing flesh, don't you?}
{44956}{}{Just warming up, the best is yet to come.}
{44957}{}{Just sharpening my claws.}
{44958}{}{Ooops! Hope you didn't need that!}
{44959}{}{If you fall over and stay there I'll go away!}
{44960}{}{Would it help you if I just stood here?}
{44961}{}{Glasses. You should look into getting some glasses.}
{44962}{}{You need me to paint a target for you?}
{44963}{}{Why are you aiming over there when I'm over here?}
{44964}{}{I hope you aren't making a career out of this.}
{44965}{}{How did you manage to miss something as big as I am?}
{44966}{}{Ha! Argh grrnnngh thppppt! (Deathclaw ridicule)}
{44967}{}{I'm a nimble little shit aint I?}
{44968}{}{You should be glad your mother didn't see you do that.}
{44969}{}{You really should consider getting more practice.}
{44970}{}{How embarrassing. I won't tell anyone how lame you are.}
{44971}{}{So, you're trained to miss the target?}
{44972}{}{Doesn't that just piss you off?}
{44973}{}{Don't cry. Maybe you'll get lucky next time.}
{44974}{}{Way to go, Grace. What do you do for an encore?}
{44975}{}{That was a shinning example of missing the target.}
{44976}{}{I'm beginning to think you're not cut out for this.}
{44977}{}{Are you trying to make me laugh myself to death?}
{44978}{}{You fanned the air on that one!}
{44979}{}{Did you just miss me or what!}

{70121}{}{I can't wait to hear some screams.}
{70122}{}{I've been just itching to kill...}
{70123}{}{Time to indulge in the joys of an unpoliced society.}
{70124}{}{Alright! Groin shot time!}
{70140}{}{Scream for me.}
{70141}{}{Let me get a better look at your blood.}
{70142}{}{I'll try and make this as painful as possible.}

{70160}{}{What a fuckin' joke.}
{70161}{}{Holy shit do you suck.}
{70162}{}{You're lucky you missed. Actually, you're not lucky, cuz I'm still gonna kill you.}

{70261}{}{Oh! I think my eye's bleeding!}
{70262}{}{My eyes!}
{70270}{}{Whoa, no hitting below the belt.}
{70271}{}{Going for the groin's not cool. Not cool at all.}
{70272}{}{Hey now! The groin's off limits.}
{70273}{}{This cat don't wanna be neutered!}
{70300}{}{A cat's got to look after himself!}
{70301}{}{Screw it, you're not worth it.}
{70302}{}{Fuck this, I'm outta' here.}
{70303}{}{Gotta Jet while I've still got a life to spare.}
{70304}{}{You won this time, monkey!}
{70320}{}{Don't worry, this'll be over *real* soon.}
{70321}{}{This cat's about to pounce!}
{70322}{}{Let's waste these smegheads.}
{70340}{}{Hurry up and die so I can go take a nap.}
{70341}{}{At least I'm killing you with style.}
{70342}{}{You best not bleed on my clothes. }
{70343}{}{I better not break a nail. }
{70360}{}{Looks like this cat's too quick for you.}
{70361}{}{Now that's just sad.}
{70362}{}{Here, let me show you how to actually *hit* something.}
{70363}{}{Hell, I almost feel sorry for you. Almost.}
{70400}{}{Ah! My head!}
{70401}{}{I think my ear's bleeding.}
{70402}{}{CÃ o! I hope that didn't break my nose.}
{70410}{}{CÃ o! My arm!}
{70411}{}{Damn, that hurts!}
{70412}{}{At least it's not broken... I don't think.}
{70420}{}{CÃ o! My arm!}
{70421}{}{Damn, that hurts!}
{70422}{}{At least it's not broken... I don't think.}
{70430}{}{I think I broke a rib.}
{70431}{}{I won't die that easily.}
{70432}{}{CÃ o! That hurt!}
{70440}{}{Not the legs!}
{70441}{}{Ah! Right in the shin.}
{70442}{}{That hurt, but at least I can still walk.}
{70450}{}{Not the legs!}
{70451}{}{Ah! Right in the shin.}
{70452}{}{That hurt, but at least I can still walk.}
{70460}{}{CÃ o! My eyes!}
{70461}{}{Cheap shot!}
{70462}{}{Hey! I can't afford another eye surgery!}
{70470}{}{I can't believe you just hit me there.}
{70471}{}{I'm not that kind of girl!}
{70472}{}{You just made this *real* personal.}
{70500}{}{Looks like I've no choice but to run...}
{70501}{}{I'd rather flee than die.}
{70502}{}{Alright. That's enough of this...}
{70520}{}{Let's get this over with.}
{70521}{}{Your death shall come swiftly.}
{70522}{}{Looks like it's come to this...}
{70540}{}{You asked for this.}
{70541}{}{I take no pleasure from this.}
{70542}{}{Now you see the consequence of your actions.}
{70560}{}{Wow, that's pathetic.}
{70561}{}{Too quick for you, huh?}
{70562}{}{Not even close.}
