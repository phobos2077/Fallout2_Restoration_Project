{100}{}{Du siehst einen verlorenen Geist.}
{101}{}{Du siehst Nessa, den verlorenen Geist.}
{102}{}{Du siehst den Geist eines hübschen jungen Mädchens, der vom kalten Schein des Mondes angestrahlt wird.}
{103}{}{I'm betrayed. Betrayed and alone.}
{104}{}{Wie konnte er mir das antun?}
{105}{}{Das Blut... Soviel Blut...}
{110}{}{He said that he loved me. That we could start over together. How could he do this?}
{111}{}{Wer hat dir das angetan? Kannst du mich hören?}
{120}{}{It's all a lie. He doesn't love me at all. Oh, he's got a knife! It hurts! The look in his eyes, so cold, so...}
{121}{}{If you can hear me, tell me who's hurting you. Who did this?}
{122}{}{Das war's -- mir reicht's. Ich bin raus aus der Nummer.}
{130}{}{He's walking away now. He's leaving me here to die alone. How could this happen?}
{131}{}{Please, just give me a name. Give me something more to work with.}
{140}{}{It wasn't supposed to be like this. You said you wanted to start a family with me. Oh, it's so cold... I think I'm dying... No! This isn't real! You would never do this to me, Thorg! I love you! Nessa will always love you...}
{141}{}{Danke, Nessa. Das ist alles, was ich hören musste. }
{150}{}{It's so lonely in the dark... So very lonely.}
{151}{}{[Fertig]}
{160}{}{The blood, it never stops flowing... why won't this pain end?}
{161}{}{Mach dir keine Sorgen Nessa, ich werde dir helfen, bald Frieden zu finden.}
