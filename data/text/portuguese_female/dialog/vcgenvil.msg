{105}{}{The monsters protect us.}
{106}{}{Welcome.}
{107}{}{We will need those rifles soon.}
{108}{}{Please hurry and bring us those weapons.}
{109}{}{Why did you kill the monsters? Now Vault City will come after us.}
{110}{}{Get out and don't come back!!}
{111}{}{Get the hell out of here!}
{112}{}{We are safe now.}
{113}{}{You have our gratitude.}
{114}{}{God be with you, stranger.}
{115}{}{Go speak to Connar.}
{116}{}{Ha! You should have seen them run!}
{117}{}{The City Patrol ran with their tails between their legs. Ha, we showed them!}
{118}{}{Who'd a thought them Vault City boys would turn out to be such cowards!}
