{100}{}{You see a modified Auto-Doc.}
{101}{}{This Auto-Doc appears to have been modified to perform experimental appearance modifications.}
{200}{}{[The machine addresses you as you approach.] Welcome, Test Subject. Thank you for volunteering your flesh for
 science. Please, step inside me and we can begin.}
{201}{}{Whoa, I never said I was volunteering anything. Now before I step anywhere, why don't you tell me exactly what you do?}
{202}{}{[Shrug.] Alright. [Step into the device.]}
{203}{}{You've got me confused with someone else. Bye.}
{300}{}{Welcome back, Test Subject. Please, step inside me and we can begin.}
{301}{}{Before I step anywhere, why don't you tell me exactly what you do?}
{302}{}{Alright. [Step into the device.]}
{303}{}{I don't think so. Bye.}
{400}{}{I'm the newest prototype of Auto-Doc technology, developed by Dr. Wood. I specialize in extreme body
 modification--the ultimate makeover. There's no need to be nervous, as my patient death rate is significantly lower
 than the previous prototype. Don't be shy, step inside me and we can begin.}
{401}{}{You're not touching me. Bye.}
{402}{}{I'd love to, but I really need to get going. Sorry.}
{403}{}{Alright. [Step into the device.]}
{410}{}{Please make your selection. Due to being an early prototype, I can only offer you limited choices. Sorry.}
{411}{}{Alter Gender.}
{412}{}{Alter Race. (Currently only White to African American or vice versa).}
{413}{}{Alter Hairstyle (Regular Hair).}
{414}{}{Alter Hairstyle (Long Hair).}
{415}{}{Alter Hairstyle (Bald).}
{416}{}{Alter Hairstyle (Blond Hair).}
{417}{}{Alter Hairstyle (Red Hair).}
{418}{}{On second thought, I don't really have time for this right now. Bye.}
{500}{}{This procedure will take four weeks for you to recover and has a 50% chance of death. Do you wish to begin now?}
{501}{}{Hagámoslo.}
{502}{}{Yes. Finally, I can be the person I've always been on the inside.}
{503}{}{Eh, maybe later. Bye.}
{504}{}{Let me choose another procedure.}
{505}{}{Hell no! I'm outta here!}
{510}{}{Excellent choice. This procedure will take two weeks for you to recover and has a 25% chance of death. Do you wish to begin now?}
{511}{}{Hagámoslo.}
{512}{}{Yes. Finally, I can be the person I've always been on the inside.}
{513}{}{Eh, maybe later. Bye.}
{514}{}{Let me choose another procedure.}
{515}{}{Hell no! I'm outta here!}
{520}{}{Excellent choice. This procedure will take one day for you to recover and has a 1% chance of death. Do you wish to begin now?}
{521}{}{Hagámoslo.}
{522}{}{Yes. Finally, I can be the person I've always been on the inside.}
{523}{}{Eh, maybe later. Bye.}
{524}{}{Let me choose another procedure.}
{525}{}{Hell no! I'm outta here!}
{600}{}{Congratulations! The experiment was a success. Thank you, and enjoy the new you.}
{601}{}{[Exit.]}
{650}{}{I'm sorry, this particular procedure is not currently available for females.}
{700}{}{I'm sorry, but something went terribly wrong with the procedure. We apologize for this inconvenience, but thank
 you for volunteering for the sake of science.}
{701}{}{Oh, mierda...}
