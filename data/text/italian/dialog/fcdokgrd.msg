{100}{}{Vedi una guardia che indossa degli abiti trasandati; sul suo volto c'e' un'espressione attenta, ma annoiata.}
{101}{}{You see a dock guard. He's unusually well armed.}
{102}{}{You see the motorboat guard.}
{150}{}{Hey! Step away from that!}
{151}{}{Don't even think about that. This is your last warning.}
{152}{}{I warned you, lao wai, now die!}
{200}{}{What do you want, lao wai?}
{201}{}{It's you again. What is it that you want, lao wai?}
{202}{}{What are you guarding?}
{203}{}{I need to use the motorboat.}
{204}{}{Nulla. Arrivederci.}
{210}{}{Everything. Don't try anything funny.}
{211}{}{Can't you be any more specific?}
{220}{}{No. Now back away, outsider.}
{221}{}{Okay. Ci vediamo.}
{222}{}{Nobody tells me what to do. You're fucking dead!}
{230}{}{And I need you to fuck right off. You're not permitted to use the motorboat, hell, you're a lao wai, not a Shi.}
{231}{}{Listen, I'm in a desperate situation. If you don't let me use that motorboat, then my entire tribe could die.
 Right now, they're in the clutches of those Enclave bastards and they're counting on me to save them. But in order to
 do that, I'm going to need to use that motorboat. If you won't let me use it, I'll have to take it by force and one of
 us will end up dead. Please, don't let it come to that.}
{232}{}{Actually, I'm an honorary member of the Shi. I was hired for the submarine maintenance team due to my expertise in... subology. Here's my password...}
{233}{}{I don't think you realize who you're insulting. Time to die, asshole.}
{234}{}{Alright, I'm going... Sheesh, some people...}
{240}{}{[He stares at you for a long moment, then sighs.] Look, no one gets on this boat without giving the proper password. You know, like the one you just gave me. [Mumbles.] Ken Lee's going to have my head for this...}
{241}{}{Thank you, friend. And don't worry, I won't speak a word of this anyone.}
{250}{}{I hope not, for both our sakes... Let me know when you're ready to use the boat. You can't bring anyone with you, as it'll draw too much attention. You'll have to go at this alone.}
{251}{}{I'd like to use it right now.}
{252}{}{Non adesso.}
{260}{}{[The guard listens to the password and nods.] I guess you really are a technician. Hmm, the Shi must be getting desperate to hire outsiders... Anyway, you're early. Didn't they tell you that the tech team doesn't leave port until midnight? You can wait for the rest of the team here, if you wish.}
{261}{}{I don't really have anything better to do, so sure...}
{262}{}{I'll come back later.}
{270}{}{Just use the mooring post and slide down the rope to the boat. Don't take too long out there, though, I don't want to get into any trouble.}
{271}{}{Capito. Ci vediamo.}
{272}{}{Easy enough. Goodbye.}
{280}{}{Ready to join the tech team?}
{281}{}{Yes, I'm ready to go.}
{282}{}{No, non ancora.}
{290}{}{Can't you see I'm busy here?}
{300}{}{Me ride metal fishy-fish?}
{310}{}{[He looks at you as if you're dumbest creature he could possibly imagine. Slowly, he shakes his head.] You no ride
 metal fishy-fish. You go. You go, or I shoot. Understand?}
{311}{}{Okie, bu-bye!}
{312}{}{You meanie-man. Me smash meanie-man!}
{500}{}{You talk your way into gaining access to the motor boat.}
