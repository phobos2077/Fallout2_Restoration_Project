{100}{}{Vedi uno schiavista.}
{101}{}{This slaver looks like one mean dude.}
{102}{}{This slaver looks like one mean chick.}
{200}{}{Eccoti qua.}
{201}{}{Adesso morirai.}
{202}{}{Shit, Rangers! Time to kick ass.}
{300}{}{You lost or something?}
{301}{}{Don is the one in charge. Talk to him.}
{302}{}{This is private property. No loitering.}
{303}{}{You don't see too many women slavers.}
{304}{}{E' bello averti tra di noi.}
{305}{}{Ciao. Come va?}
{306}{}{Hai beccato qualche schiavo?}
{307}{}{Ciao.}
{308}{}{Heading out on another run?}
{309}{}{La situazione e' piuttosto tranquilla.}
{310}{}{When am I gonna see some action?}
{311}{}{Bagging slaves always brings a smile to my face.}
{312}{}{I raid per gli schiavi sono davvero grandiosi.}
{313}{}{Hey, glad to have you with us.}
{400}{}{Hold it right there. Where the hell do you think you're going?}
{401}{}{Metzger sent me. I need to speak with whoever is in charge here.}
{402}{}{I got some slaves you guys might be interested in.}
{403}{}{I was called because of a rodent problem. Namely all of you here.}
{404}{}{[The man's eyes flare up.] You've picked the wrong group to fuck with. HEY GUYS, WE GOT AN INTRUDER!}
{405}{}{[He looks up and down your party members.] I think we might be interested. Go inside and speak with Don.}
{406}{}{Isn't it a little early for another shipment? What does Metzger need?}
{407}{}{He needs a few healthy slaves. Specifically female slaves, if you know what I mean.}
{408}{}{Hehe. I sure do. Well, go inside and speak to Don. I'm sure he's got what the boss needs.}
{409}{}{Umm... well, he uhh, said he needs more slaves.}
{410}{}{More slaves? He got a huge shipment last week. You're full of shit and I don't have time for this. Leave now
 or you'll find a bullet in your head.}
{411}{}{Me ne stavo andando.}
{412}{}{I think I'll stay and kill you first.}
{500}{}{Umm..uhh... the boss sent me.}
{501}{}{The "boss" huh? Sounds like your full of shit me. Looks like we got a trespasser.}
{502}{}{Listen, I'm on orders from the boss. You know how he gets when we keep him waiting.}
{503}{}{Metzger sent you, huh? Man, he can be a real pain sometimes. But, uh, (The man fidgets) don't tell anyone I said that.}
{504}{}{Yep, Metzger sent me alright. Now, I need to speak with whose in charge here.}
{599}{}{Touch it again and you die.}
{600}{}{I warned you asshole!}
{800}{}{[FATTO]}
{900}{}{What the!? Rangers! Shit, how did they find us. Alright, time to kick some ass!}
