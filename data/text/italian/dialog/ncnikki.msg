{370}{}{What do you want now? You here to waste my time, or you gonna place a bet?}
{371}{}{I'm whoever you WANT me to be, sweetheart. Now, you gonna place a bet?}
{372}{}{I'm whoever you WANT me to be, girlfriend. Now, you gonna place a bet?}
{373}{}{Place a bet.}
{374}{}{Yeah. I'm betting you know where Pretty Boy Lloyd is.}
{375}{}{Yeah, I'm betting you and Pretty Boy Lloyd were both stealing money from Mr. Salvatore. Hard to believe you
 didn't notice him cheating all those times.}
{376}{}{You know somebody named Pretty Boy Lloyd?}
{377}{}{We'll talk later, Nikki.}
{380}{}{Yeah, I heard he's DEAD. That what you want to hear, killer?! Huh?! Now you gonna place a bet or bullshit me some more?}
{381}{}{Nope. You gonna place a bet?}
{382}{}{Place a bet.}
{383}{}{Yeah. I'm betting you know where Pretty Boy Lloyd is.}
{384}{}{Yeah, I'm betting you and Pretty Boy Lloyd were both stealing money from Mr. Salvatore. Hard to believe you didn't notice
 Lloyd cheating all those times.}
{385}{}{We'll talk later, Nikki.}
{390}{}{Then that's a bet you'd LOSE, sweetheart, but if you're as stupid as you are ugly, you'd probably bet anyway. I ain't
 seen that bum since he conned Mr. Salvatore.}
{391}{}{Then that's a bet you'd lose, sweetheart. I ain't seen that bum since he pulled that swindle on Mr. Salvatore.}
{392}{}{Then that's a bet you'd lose, girlfriend. I ain't seen that bum since he pulled that swindle on Mr. Salvatore.}
{393}{}{Maybe you didn't hear me the first time, so for the benefit of the hearing impaired: Where is Lloyd?}
{394}{}{Pretty suspicious you didn't notice him cheating all those times. You'd have to be blind... or bribed.}
{395}{}{Fine. We'll talk later, Nikki.}
{400}{}{Sweetheart, I TOLD you that I don't know where he is. Now, look, I'm WORKING here, so go back to whatever rock you --}
{401}{}{Girlfriend, I TOLD you that I don't know where he is. Now, look, I'm WORKING here, so go back to whatever rock you --}
{402}{}{Nikki, Nikki... I'm losing PATIENCE here. If you don't tell me where Lloyd is, I'm going to lose my temper, too.}
{403}{}{Nikki, I don't know what happened between you and Lloyd. But guess what? I don't NEED to know. I'll just tell
 Mr. Salvatore what I suspect.}
{404}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}
{405}{}{Pretty suspicious you didn't notice him cheating all those times. You'd have to be blind... or bribed.}
{406}{}{We'll talk later then, Nikki.}
{410}{}{You touch me, and Mr. Salvatore will skin you alive.}
{411}{}{Salvatore won't protect you; dealers like you are a chip a dozen. Cut the shit and tell me where Lloyd is or ELSE.}
{412}{}{Salvatore won't protect you; he's dead. Cut the shit and tell me where Lloyd is or ELSE.}
{413}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}
{414}{}{Pretty suspicious you didn't notice him cheating all those times. You'd have to be blind... or bribed.}
{415}{}{We'll talk later then, Nikki.}
{420}{}{Di cosa stai parlando?}
{421}{}{Nikki, if you don't tell me everything right now, I'll tell Mr. Salvatore you were in on it, whether you were or not.
 He'll have Mason cut you up seven ways to Sunday, and have your job filled in an hour.}
{422}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}
{423}{}{Pretty suspicious you didn't notice him cheating all those times. You'd have to be blind... or bribed.}
{424}{}{We'll talk later then, Nikki.}
{430}{}{Look, LIKE I SAID, I don't know where he is. But *maybe* I heard he used to have a room at the Desperado. You might find
 something there. Now, if you don't mind, I got to get back to work.}
{431}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}
{432}{}{Pretty suspicious that you didn't notice him cheating all those times. You'd have to be blind... or bribed.}
{433}{}{We'll talk later then, Nikki.}
{440}{}{Look, I just STARTED working here, and I can't recognize every card counter and two-bit cheat that walks in.
 I gotta pretty good line on shitheads like you, though.}
{441}{}{Oh, so that's how you and Lloyd hooked up then?}
{442}{}{So you just started work, huh? Pretty convenient. Well, that's all I need to know. Tell Lloyd he's a dead man.}
{443}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}
{444}{}{We'll talk later then, Nikki.}
{450}{}{Yeah, you take enough Jet, and everything seems suspicious, don't it?}
{451}{}{It IS suspicious. You should have had Lloyd pegged for what he was as soon as he walked in this casino.}
{452}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}
{453}{}{We'll talk later then, Nikki.}
{460}{}{You get the hell outta here right now. I ain't got nothing else to say to you.}
{461}{}{I got nothing to say to you. Get out of here.}
{462}{}{Not now, maybe. We'll talk later though, Nikki. Count on it.}
{470}{}{You talk smooth...but so do snakes. MAYBE I know where Lloyd is, MAYBE I don't. You got 500 chips?}
{471}{}{Maybe. Depends on what you got for me.}
{480}{}{COULD be that Lloyd still has my take, and I ain't sure he's gonna give it to me. So COULD be that - for 500 chips - I
 COULD tell you where his lying ass is hanging out.}
{481}{}{Done. Here's the 500 chips. Tell me where he is.}
{482}{}{That's a pretty steep price for a whole bunch of "maybes" and "coulds." I'll find him on my own.}
{483}{}{I don't have enough chips, but I'll be back. You better still be here when I return.}
{490}{}{(Pockets the money) Check the boiler room in the basement of the Desperado. That's where the son of a bitch was
 going to run if things got hot.}
{491}{}{All right then. Later, Nikki.}
{500}{}{Would you get outta here?! People see us talking like this, then THEY'RE gonna talk. Understand?}
{501}{}{All right then. Later, Nikki.}
{510}{}{Go to hell, then! I ain't got nothing else to say to you, EVER.}
{511}{}{Breaks my heart. Later, Nikki.}
{600}{}{You bribe Nikki in telling you where Lloyd might be hiding.}
{1210}{}{. Can I help you with... anything?}
{1214}{}{.}
{1235}{}{. Che ne dici di giocare un po'?}
{1239}{}{, e vincerai dei soldi.}
{1241}{}{.}
{1242}{}{. Fammi sapere se ti serve qualcosa.}
{1243}{}{?}
{1244}{}{.}
{1251}{}{...(winks)...you looking to gamble?}
{1252}{}{...(smiles)...wanna take a chance?}
{1253}{}{, you came to the right place.}
{1266}{}{, e vincerai dei soldi.}
{1268}{}{.}
{1314}{}{ could always use new inventory item}
{2699}{}{Farai uno spettacolo qui, stanotte?}
