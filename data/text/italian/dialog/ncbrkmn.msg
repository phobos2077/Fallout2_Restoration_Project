{100}{}{You see a grungy, shaggy looking man.}
{101}{}{His clothes are torn and dirty. He has several scratches on his arms and legs.}
{150}{}{Woof! Wooof. Woooof.}
{151}{}{Uh, are you alright?}
{152}{}{Uh, right. Bye.}
{153}{}{Hey, I think I found something that might help your condition.}
{154}{}{Hmm... Sounds like you might be suffering from some neurological disorder, maybe epilepsy. Sadly, I cannot
 do anything about it. Bye.}
{160}{}{Woof. Woof woof. Woooof.}
{250}{}{Grrr!}
{251}{}{Grrrrrr!}
{252}{}{Grrrrrrrr!}
{253}{}{Grrrrrrrrrr!}
{254}{}{[Shamble away]}
{255}{}{Grrrrrrrrr! Grrr! Woof!}
{256}{}{(The man wimpers and scurries away.)}
{257}{}{Hehe. Nice doggie...}
{258}{}{Hehe. Me super doogie...}
{300}{}{Woof?}
{301}{}{Yeah. Just listen closely to this series of letters I am about to say...}
{302}{}{(You slowly verbalize the series of letters you learned from the computer at the EPA, making sure the correct
 inflections are used on each letter. When you are done reading the phrase you look back up at the man. He looks back
 at you then shakes his whole body like a dog trying to dry himself after a rainstorm.)}
{303}{}{[AVANTI]}
{304}{}{Woo- Woah. Hey, I can speak normally! Wow, this is great. What'd you do to me?}
{305}{}{I learned that if you read a specific series of letters, making sure to use the correct inflections on each
 letter, you can cure someone with either autism or epilepsy.}
{306}{}{Sounds like a bunch of hoop-la to me, but hey, I'm talking, so there must be something to it. Anyway, I really
 appreciate what you've done. Here, take these stimpaks. I found 'em when I was scavenging for food behind all these buildings.}
{307}{}{Thanks. See you around.}
{350}{}{Uff!}
{351}{}{Woof! Woooof!}
{352}{}{*scratches self*}
{400}{}{Woof! Heh, just kidding. Thanks again for curing me.}
{500}{}{You cure the Barking Man.}
{600}{}{*whimper*}
{601}{}{He looks at you with big, scared eyes.}
