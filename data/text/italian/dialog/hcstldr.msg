{100}{}{You see a man dressed in robes.}
{101}{}{You see Ashton. He is in charge here.}
{102}{}{He has a smirk on his face.}
{200}{}{Greetings. My name is Ashton, and I'm in charge of things here. Were you sent here for security detail?}
{201}{}{Yeah, actually, I was.}
{202}{}{No, I was sent by AHS-9 to check on everything.}
{210}{}{Excellent! Never can have too much security with what we have stored here, I say. Good to have you here.}
{211}{}{Really? That's... interesting. You're free to look around, of course. I'm sure you'll find that everything is in order.}
{220}{}{Thanks. What exactly are we storing here, anyway?}
{221}{}{Alright then. See you around.}
{230}{}{As you're certainly aware, every donation to the Church of Hubology over the last several decades is stored here -- and I must say,
 it's quite a stash. Some donations are small; others quite large. We get all kinds of stuff, from weapons and ammunition, to jewelry,
 and antiques, and even a few old vehicles. Why, just a few months ago, actor Don Ravolta donated a genuine 20th century Harkley Sports
 motorcycle -- best of its time. Heck, a working Howitzer was even donated to the Church. Our most common donation, however, is money -- lots and
 lots of money.}
{240}{}{Impressive. It sounds like the Church does quite well for itself.}
{241}{}{Yes, of course -- and for good reason. Advertising campaigns and a massive space shuttle aren't cheap activities you know.}
{242}{}{Yeah, I can imagine. So, how large is this place?}
{243}{}{I know what you mean. Well, I must be going. Bye.}
{250}{}{The structure we're standing in is an older bunker, probably built for private use rather than military. There's two levels below us.
 Directly below us is the living area -- we got some beds there, bathrooms, exercise machines, security equipment. Below that is what I call the "vault."}
{251}{}{A vault?}
{252}{}{It's not *really* a vault, I just call it that. It's more of a storage room full of goods. That's where we keep all the donations. It's guarded all day, everyday.}
{260}{}{Interesting. Well, I'm going to have a look around. See you later.}
{270}{}{So, how large is this place?}
{300}{}{Hello again. Help you with something?}
{301}{}{Nope, just looking around. Bye.}
