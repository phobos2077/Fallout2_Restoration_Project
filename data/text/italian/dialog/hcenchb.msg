{100}{}{Vedi una persona annoiata che indossa un'armatura di cuoio.}
{101}{}{Vedi Max, la guardia della carovana.}
{102}{}{Vedi una persona annoiata e coperta di polvere che indossa un'armatura di cuoio. Dalla puzza di brahmin che emana e dall'incedere sicuro, capisci che si tratta di una guardia della carovana.}
{103}{}{Posso aiutarti?}
{104}{}{Urg?}
{105}{}{Me lavorare qui!}
{106}{}{Chi sei?}
{107}{}{Cosa puoi dirmi a proposito di Chad?}
{108}{}{Non ho tempo da perdere con gli idioti. Spiacente, amico, ma dovrai cercare qualcun altro con cui giocare.}
{109}{}{::sniff::}
{110}{}{Io sono Max. Sono una delle guardie della carovana.}
{111}{}{Cosa puoi dirmi a proposito di Chad?}
{112}{}{Grazie. Ciao.}
{113}{}{Honestly? I don't care for the guy. Lately, he's been tossing around a lot of coin. I mean, sure, he's the
 caravan master, so it makes sense for him to take a larger cut--I understand that. But there's no way he should be
 *that* loaded. I think it'd be *real* interesting to take a peek at his records.}
{114}{}{Marcus told me he suspects Chad of skimming some of the caravan money that supposed to be going to Broken Hills.
 I told him I'd look into it.}
{115}{}{Grazie. Ciao.}
{116}{}{Thanks. I'm sure glad that's over. You better watch your back though.}
{117}{}{Addio.}
{118}{}{Il nemico! Muori!}
{119}{}{Oops.}
{120}{}{[Lowers his voice and looks around.] That's gotta be it. In fact, I was a guard on the latest uranium run to
 Gecko, and I overheard Chad arguing with their ghoul rep. Apparently, Broken Hills had recently been jacking up the
 price of uranium, and the ghoul wasn't too happy about it. Then I hear Chad explain to him our uranium supply was
 running low due to a recent miners' strike, but the thing is, there never was a strike.}
{121}{}{Really? Then why didn't you report that to Marcus?}
{122}{}{Are you insane? Chad's a powerful guy in this town and he's got a lot of friends. If I try to rat him out, there's a lot of people that'd hate me. Hell, I might even get killed.}
{123}{}{Hmm, then perhaps I could say something to Marcus. I don't plan to stay around here too much longer anyway.}
{124}{}{Hey, you do what you need to do, just don't drag me into it. In fact, we never had this conversation, OK?}
{125}{}{Nessun problema. Addio.}
{126}{}{Actually, one more thing. I know Chad keeps records of all the transactions he makes. He's kind of a record freak.
 In fact, the guy's such a nut about it, I bet he even has records of all the money he's been skimming. The problem is,
 he keeps all the stuff locked up in his house on the other side of town, and there's no way you're getting in there--his
 locking system's too complex. Again, we never had this conversation.}
{127}{}{I'll find a way. Thanks for the extra info.}
{128}{}{Complex system? How am I supposed to get in then?}
{129}{}{[Max thinks hard for a moment.] Alright, listen. You look like someone I can trust. The door to Chad's house is
 locked using the most advanced non-electronic locking system there is -- this one's a real beauty. I should know, since I
 designed it. You see, before I was a caravan guard, I used to be a locksmith. Now, since I assume you'll be needing to
 get into that house, let me explain how to pick these types of locks.}
{130}{}{(About five minutes later Max is done explaining the workings of his locks.) There you go, that should be enough to get in there.
 With this information even a novice can pick one of those locks. You be careful now. Oh, and we never had this conversation.}
{131}{}{Don't worry. Thanks for the extra info.}
{200}{}{You learn about Chad's recent skimming from the Gecko caravans.}
