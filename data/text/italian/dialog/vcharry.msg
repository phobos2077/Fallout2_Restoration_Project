{100}{}{Vedi un uomo basso e gioviale.}
{101}{}{Vedi Happy Harry, il proprietario del negozio.}
{102}{}{Beh, salve... cosa posso fare per te?}
{103}{}{Vorrei barattare delle cose. Posso vedere cos'hai?}
{104}{}{E' ancora in vendita quell'aratro la' fuori?}
{105}{}{Me compra}
{106}{}{Per oggi niente, grazie.}
{107}{}{Spiacente. Non posso aiutarti, vicino.}
{108}{}{Beh, si'. Te lo posso vendere per... diciamo... ottocento.}
{109}{}{Te ne daro' seicento.}
{110}{}{D'accordo. Lo prendo.}
{111}{}{Eh, ottocento? Tornero'... con i soldi.}
{112}{}{Scordatelo. Gli Smith possono anche morire di fame.}
{113}{}{E' tuo. [incassa il denaro.] Lo prendi subito, o desideri che venga recapitato da qualche parte?}
{114}{}{Consegnalo agli Smith.}
{115}{}{Spiacente, amico. Ti costera' ottocento monete.}
{119}{}{Hai bisogno dei soldi per pagarmi, amico.}
{120}{}{Tornero' con i soldi.}
{121}{}{Nessun problema. Lo faro' consegnare immediatamente.}
{122}{}{Credevi di poterti servire da solo, eh? Dannato ladro... Guardie! Guardie!}
{123}{}{Dave sent me. We're trying to fix a broken water pump, and he said you'd have a replacement motor.}
{124}{}{Working with Dave, eh? Yeah, I know the fella. I see he's still got a knack for getting others to do his leg work--lazy bastard.
 [He chuckles.] Anyway, I think I got what you're lookin for, but lemme just go back an' check. [Harry goes into his back room where you
 hear boxes being shuffled and moved around. He returns a minute later.] Yep, got it right here. $500 and she's all yours.}
{125}{}{Sure. Here's the money.}
{126}{}{500? Damn. I hope I get reimbursed for this. Fine, here is the money.}
{127}{}{Thanks for the business. Take care.}
{128}{}{Addio.}
{129}{}{Connar sent me for the goods.}
{130}{}{[Harry's eyes dart around quickly, he seems a bit nervous] Yes, sure. Just a moment...}
{131}{}{[Harry brings you the rifles.] Here, take em. That'll be ten thousand, and let's make this snappy.}
{132}{}{Of course, here's the money.}
{133}{}{But Connar only gave me five grand.}
{134}{}{But Connar only gave me two grand.}
{135}{}{Not my problem. Look, my business struggles enough as it is. If anyone finds out I'm providing Connar with weapons, then things will turn real ugly, real fast. Besides, I'm giving him a discount already.}
{136}{}{Look, I'm putting my neck on the line . . . Oh, to hell with it, I don't have time to argue. Just take em. [He quickly pockets your money.] Now get outta here. And remember, you didn't buy those from me.}
{137}{}{Excellent. But remember, you didn't buy these weapons here.}
{138}{}{It's a deal. Bye.}
{139}{}{[AVANTI]}
{140}{}{Well then, wait a bit until I get the money.}
{141}{}{Well, have you brought the money?}
{142}{}{What if I just give you five grand?}
{143}{}{What about two grand?}
{144}{}{Ehmmm... ten grand?! I don't have that much money; wait a bit until I get it.}
{145}{}{Damn! Who could possibly have turned me in?!}
{146}{}{Hey! What was I imprisoned for?}
{147}{}{Well, at least the food's not bad.}
{148}{}{Che cosa stai guardando?}
{149}{}{What will happen to my shop now?}
{200}{}{$500? Hey, maybe you could give me some kind of discount, I mean, you and Dave are friends, right?}
{201}{}{To tell you the truth, I never really cared for the fella. $500 for the motor. Take it or leave it.}
{202}{}{Fine. Here's the money.}
{203}{}{Forget it, I'm outta here.}
{204}{}{$500!? Forget this, I'm outta here.}
{1288}{}{Looks like I don't have enough money. Bye.}
