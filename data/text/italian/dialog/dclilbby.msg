{100}{}{Vedi un ragazzino.}
{101}{}{You see Little Bobby.}
{102}{}{He is wearing dirty clothing and has bruises on his neck and face.}
{103}{}{He is wearing new clothing and has a smile on his face.}
{104}{}{Hi mister! My name's Bobby and I live here with my Dad.}
{105}{}{Hi miss! My name's Bobby and I live here with my Dad.}
{106}{}{I see. Well tha-}
{107}{}{Are you here 'cause my dad owes you money? I don't know if he's here or not. But if I knew where he was,
 I'd tell you, 'cause maybe you'd beat him up so bad he wouldn't ever come home again.}
{108}{}{This sounds horrible, Bobby. Your father has no right to treat you that way -- no parent does.}
{109}{}{Hah! I'd beat my son too if he didn't listen to me. Your father sounds like a good man.}
{110}{}{[His eyes light up.] You aren't like the others that come through here. I like you. [He sighs heavily.]
 I wish my dad was more like you. Sometimes I think about running away. Some of my friends don't have homes, and they say
 it's not so bad. As long as they bring Mr. Flick enough things, they get to eat once a day. But Mr. Flick doesn't sound very
 nice either -- actually, he sounds a lot like my dad.}
{111}{}{You're a meanie! Go away. I don't like you.}
{112}{}{There's gotta be something that can be done about this. Can you think of any adults in this town that'd be willing to
 look after you -- or any of these homeless kids?}
{113}{}{[Bobby shrugs.] Maybe Mom? I don't mean *my* mom -- my mom's dead -- but there's a lady that people call Mom. I dunno why.
 Maybe 'cause she's really nice? She's got a diner on the other side of town. [He points to the Northeast.] My homeless friends go
 there and she sneaks them free food. I wish Dad would take me there, 'cause she knows how to make rat taste really yummy!}
{114}{}{Hmm, I *am* feeling a bit hungry. Perhaps I'll go pay Mom a visit. You take care of yourself, Bobby.}
{115}{}{You're such a little brat. I better leave now before I kick the shit outta you. Bye.}
{116}{}{Guess what, Bobby? I spoke with Mom, and she's going to be opening up a nice big new home where you and all your
 homeless friends are welcome to go live together. It's going to be in the big building that's right across the street from here.
 She said she'll have it all set up in a couple days.}
{117}{}{[A huge smile lights up the boy's face.] Really? That's great! [He hugs you.] I can't wait to live there with all my
 friends! I'm so excited! Thanks again mister, you're the best!}
{118}{}{[A huge smile lights up the boy's face.] Really? That's great! [He hugs you.] I can't wait to live there with all my
 friends! I'm so excited! Thanks again miss, you're the best!}
{119}{}{You're welcome kid. See you around.}
{120}{}{Hi again! Did you talk to the Mom lady?}
{121}{}{Don't worry Bobby, I'm working on it.}
{122}{}{You help Bobby find a better life.}
{123}{}{Hi again! Thanks for everything. I love this new place. Mom is such a great lady!}
{124}{}{I love this new place. Mom is such a great lady!}
{125}{}{I'm so excited! Time to pack my stuff.}
{126}{}{I wonder if dad will notice I am gone.}
{127}{}{This is going to be so much better.}
{200}{}{I don't like you. Go away!}
{210}{}{It sounds like you're not too fond of your dad. Mind if I ask why?}
{211}{}{You little brat, what gives you the right to talk about your dad like that?}
{220}{}{Cause my dad's not very nice. He leaves me home alone all the time, and when he *is* home, he's always drunk or
 he says he's flying on Jet, which is a lie 'cause I never see him fly anywhere. Sometimes, he brings a
 girlfriend home -- he's got lots of girlfriends -- and he makes me go outside for awhile, even if its the middle of the night
 and it's cold or raining.}
{221}{}{That's-}
{230}{}{Oh! And sometimes he tells me to take things from people in secret. He says it's a game and that he gives it back later,
 but I don't' believe him. But if I don't do it, then he gets real mad and his eyes get all scary looking, and he hurts me.
 See? [He lifts up his shirt sleeve, revealing a nasty bruise on his arm.]}
