{100}{}{You see an elderly man with deep wrinkles along his face.}
{101}{}{You see John MacRae.}
{102}{}{Hey now, I ain't seen you around before. I'm MacRae -- I run this place.
 What can I do for you?}
{103}{}{Sto cercando il Vault.}
{104}{}{Hai voglia di lasciare questo posto?}
{105}{}{What do you have here?}
{106}{}{Anything going on around here?}
{107}{}{Ug Nog}
{108}{}{Per oggi niente, grazie.}
{109}{}{Vault? L'unico Vault che conosco e' quello all'interno della citta'. Un grosso, fottutissimo buco... Non puoi mancarlo, credimi.}
{110}{}{Cos'avete da bere, qui?}
{111}{}{Anything going on around here?}
{112}{}{Grazie per le indicazioni. addio.}
{113}{}{Standard crap. Beer for $20, shot of whiskey for $30. Nothing
 special. You want something?}
{114}{}{You know about the Vault?}
{115}{}{Prendero' una birra.}
{116}{}{Prendero' il whiskey.}
{117}{}{Cosa succede da queste parti?}
{118}{}{Nothing today, thanks. Goodbye.}
{119}{}{Around here? Same old, same old. Bores me to tears most of the time.
 Why, you looking for something?}
{120}{}{Cos'avete da bere, qui?}
{121}{}{Do you know anything about the Vault?}
{122}{}{It can't be that bad.}
{123}{}{Nulla. Arrivederci.}
{124}{}{Ah... hit on the head a little too often, I see. Sorry, I don't speak
 imbecile.}
{125}{}{Here you go. Drink up. It's about the only fun you'll see in this
 tight-ass place.}
{126}{}{It can't be that bad.}
{127}{}{Thanks for the drink. I guess I'll be going.}
{128}{}{Look. I asked if you wanted a drink and then told you what it would cost.
 Most people understand the process. If you don't got the money, you shouldn't have
 asked.}
{129}{}{Sorry. Thought I had the cash. Not being able to see your money in the
 dialogue screen creates some problems, y'know?}
{130}{}{Yeah... whatever. I'm out of here.}
{131}{}{It's worse. The Citizens don't drink much, so I'm stuck here giving merchants
 drinks. The next cheap bastard who tries to haggle for a drink is going to find
 my boot in his ass.}
{132}{}{Sembri piuttosto stufo di questo posto.}
{133}{}{Sorry to hear that. What do you know about the Vault?}
{134}{}{We all make mistakes... some more than others. So what do you want?}
{135}{}{Cosa succede da queste parti?}
{136}{}{Nothing today, thanks. Goodbye.}
{137}{}{Yeah, wish I could get the hell outta here.}
{138}{}{Perche' non te vai?}
{139}{}{Go into the wastes by myself? I'm bored, but I'm not stupid.}
{140}{}{Io sto per andarmene da qui. Perche' non vieni con me?}
{141}{}{Beh, buona fortuna.}
{142}{}{Naw... you look like you got enough people following you around.}
{143}{}{D'accordo. Beh, buona fortuna.}
{144}{}{You know, that doesn't sound like a half bad idea. Count me in.}
{145}{}{Yeah, what?}
{146}{}{Voglio che tu ti tolga di mezzo.}
{147}{}{Come stai?}
{148}{}{Curati.}
{149}{}{Voglio che tu stia qua finche' non ritorno.}
{150}{}{You! Ooyag!}
{151}{}{E' tutto, per ora.}
{152}{}{OK, everything's stitched up. Let's get going.}
{153}{}{OK, pretty much everything is patched up.}
{154}{}{Sono quasi a posto, ma mi farebbe comodo un altro paio di stim.}
{155}{}{I used what I could, but I'm still pretty messed up. Got any stims on you?}
{156}{}{Use First Aid on yourself.}
{157}{}{Lasciamo stare.}
{158}{}{OK.}
{159}{}{OK, I'll wait here.}
{160}{}{Lasciamo stare.}
{161}{}{OK.}
{162}{}{Let's get going.}
{163}{}{OK.}
{164}{}{Look, you have enough people following your coat tails now.}
{165}{}{Yeah, you go with that.}
{166}{}{Naw... I think I'll pass.}
{167}{}{I think I'm just going to hang around here a little longer.}
