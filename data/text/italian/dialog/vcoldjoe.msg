{100}{}{Vedi un vecchio con un barlume di follia negli occhi.}
{101}{}{Vedi il Vecchio Joe, l'"idiot savant" locale.}
{102}{}{Ciao. E' da un po' che non ci si vede.}
{103}{}{Ti conosco?}
{104}{}{Ah, si'. E' da un po'. Che cosa hai fatto in questo periodo?}
{105}{}{Beh, e' passato un po' di tempo. Cos'hai fatto in questo periodo?}
{106}{}{Un po' questo e un po' quello. Come fai a conoscermi?}
{107}{}{Senti, vecchio, non so chi diavolo tu sia.}
{108}{}{Eh, si'. Beh, ho girato un po'; alla fine sono finito qui, in questo posto dimenticato da dio. Non e' come i bei vecchi tempi. Nossignore.}
{109}{}{Certo, i bei vecchi tempi. Ricordi quella volta che noi...}
{110}{}{Ultimamente non e' piu' lo stesso, questo e' sicuro. Ora... cos'abbiamo fatto insieme?}
{111}{}{Non ti ricordi di me, eh? Infatti mi sembri un po' troppo giovane.}
{112}{}{Cosa stai cercando di dirmi?}
{113}{}{Hai un'aria cosi' familiare, pero'... Ah, devono essere i miei vecchi occhi. Beh, buona giornata a te.}
{114}{}{Uh, certo... addio.}
{115}{}{Gia'... abbiamo proprio fatto vedere l'inferno al Master, vero? E' andato tutto a puttane dopo che te ne sei andato. Sono stato costretto a spostarmi di continuo e a cambiar nome. Dov'eri finito?}
{116}{}{Ho vissuto in un piccolo villaggio.}
{117}{}{Beh, farai meglio a stare attento da queste parti. Le cose non sono cosi' chiare come una volta. Farai meglio a guardarti le spalle.}
{118}{}{Okay, grazie.}
{119}{}{Ho cercato il tuo Vault per un po', ma non l'ho mai trovato. Allora, hai qualche bella storia da raccontare al tuo vecchio amico Ian?}
{120}{}{Ian?}
{121}{}{Certo, Ian. Non ti ricordi di me? Sono passati un sacco di anni. Pensavo che non avresti mai dimenticato il tuo migliore amico. Beh... a parte quella faccenda degli spari alla schiena. Scusami ancora per quello.}
{122}{}{Mi dispiace, ma forse mi hai scambiato l'Abitante del Vault. Il mio villaggio e' stato fondato da una persona che proveniva dal Vault.}
{123}{}{Beh, questo spiega un po' le cose. Beh, mi fa piacere sentire che il mio amico ha fatto qualcosa di buono. Beh, il vecchio Ian ha un consiglio per te. Sta' attento. Questo posto non e' cosi' candido come sembra.}
{124}{}{Cosa sta succedendo?}
{125}{}{Beh, i Cittadini di Vault City tengono molto alla loro stirpe e non considerano molto le persone come me e te. Prendi questa. Ti proteggera' se le cose dovessero complicarsi un po'. Probabilmente non dovresti farti vedere a parlare con un vecchio pazzo. Farai meglio ad andartene.}
{126}{}{Thanks for your help. Bye.}
{127}{}{Lascia riposare questo povero vecchio.}
{128}{}{Cosi' familiare...}
{129}{}{Adesso lasciami solo.}
{130}{}{Faresti meglio ad andare.}
{131}{}{Si insospettiranno se ci vedono parlare ancora.}
{132}{}{Su, vai. Fa' in modo che il mio vecchio amico sia fiero di te.}
{133}{}{Thanks. One more thing though. I'm trying to help this little village that's north-east of here. A guy there named Connar told me to seek you out and speak with you.}
{134}{}{Connar, huh? He's a good guy. I've been keeping my eye on things for him. So what exactly does Connar want, now?}
{135}{}{He's trying to get his hands on some weapons. He thinks if they had some firepower, they'd be able to keep the Vault City patrols at bay.}
{136}{}{Ah, so that's his new plan, eh? Well, head over to Happy Harry's general store. Tell Harry Connar sent you, and he should be able to fix you up -- I believe he's got some guns stashed away for just such an occasion. But if you ask me, I'm not sure this is the best way to handle things.}
{137}{}{I'm off to speak with Harry then. Take care ol' friend.}
{138}{}{Why, what do you mean?}
{139}{}{Connar and his people have that strong fighting spirit, but it won't be enough in this case. Vault City have nearly unlimited resources, and eventually, they'll win out. Sometimes, it's best to talk things out and try to reason with people. That's a lesson I learned from my old friend, the Vault Dweller. Senior Council Member McClure has shown to be a reasonable man. Perhaps some agreement can be made with him?}
{140}{}{Hmm... I may have to consider this. Thanks for everything, bye.}
{141}{}{Perhaps I'll go speak with him then. However, I was curious about the mole rats that are guarding the village.}
{142}{}{Si', cosa vuoi dirmi?}
{143}{}{Any idea where they're from or who's controlling them?}
{144}{}{That, I'm not sure about. A bunch of ghouls came by with them. They were carrying strange amulets and talking about some "Renewal". That's pretty much all I know. You might wanna check out Gecko though. That place is bustling with ghouls. Speaking of big rats, did I ever tell you about the time the Vault Dweller and I went to Vault 15?}
{145}{}{No, but I'm well versed in the tale, as it's become a sacred legend in my tribe. Anyway, maybe I'll go see what I can find in Gecko. Take care, Ian.}
{146}{}{Uh, thanks for the tip. I think you are the man I need to see though. Connar sent me to ask you for some things.}
{147}{}{Wait a minute! Connar told me you have some information.}
{148}{}{No, but I'm well versed in the tale, as it's become a sacred legend in my tribe. Anyway, maybe I'll go see what I can find in Gecko. Take care.}
{150}{}{He was interested in getting some weaponry to fight off the Vault City patrols, but I convinced him that there's a better solution.}
{151}{}{Ah, so that's his new plan, eh? Yeah, Connar's a good man, but he doesn't always think things all the way through. Sometimes, it's best to talk things out and try to reason with people. That's a lesson I learned from my old friend, the Vault Dweller.}
{152}{}{Well, any idea who on the council I might be able to talk to?}
{153}{}{I think Senior Council Member McClure might be the man to talk to. What do you think?}
{154}{}{Senior Council Member McClure is a smart man here in Vault City. Perhaps some agreement can be made with him?}
{155}{}{Alright. I'll try to speak with him. Bye.}
{156}{}{Perhaps I'll go speak with him then. However, I was curious about the mole rats that are guarding the village.}
{157}{}{He'd be your best bet. He is the only one on the council that has a reasonable soul left.}
{158}{}{Alright. I'll try to speak with him. Bye.}
{159}{}{I will go speak with him then. I was curious about the molerats that are guarding the village though.}
{200}{}{Hey, if you really are the same Ian that journeyed with my ancestor, then I've got a question for you.}
{201}{}{Alright, let's hear it.}
{202}{}{How the hell are you still alive? You must be over a hundred years old. Not to mention the Vault Dweller's memoirs, which say you were burnt to death in Necropolis by a super mutant with a flame thrower.}
{203}{}{[He barks gruff laughter for awhile; finally, he settles down and wipes a couple tears from his eyes.] Oh, that's rich. Burnt to death by a flame thrower, ha! You see, I told the Vault Dweller to make up some story about how I died, 'cause I didn't want any of our old enemies trying to hunt me down -- that's why I changed my name. I told him to have me going down in a blaze of glory, and it looks like he took that literally. Ha, that's classic.}
{204}{}{Heh, I guess that solves that. I was curious about the molerats that are guarding the village though.}
{205}{}{That still doesn't explain how you're still alive and well after all these years.}
{206}{}{Hey, I'm just as confused as you are. Who knows? Maybe it's got something to do with all that radiation I was exposed to back in the old days. Hell, when we went to the Glow, I remember the Vault Dweller was popping Rad-X like candy, but did he offer any to ol' Ian? Of course not. I think he was still upset over a little friendly fire mishap. Heh heh. [Sigh.] Those were some good times.}
{207}{}{I'm sure they were. Thanks for the story Joe, er, Ian. Take care.}
{208}{}{I'm sure they were. Thanks for the story Joe, er, Ian. I was curious about the molerats that are guarding the village though.}
{300}{}{Wait a minute! Are you the contact in Vault City that Connar was talking about?}
