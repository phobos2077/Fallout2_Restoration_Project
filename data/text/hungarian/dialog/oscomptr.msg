{331}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{332}{}{Let it be known that I took little joy in exiling our "great hero", but I had no choice in the matter. His adventures in the outside world had changed him too much. He was too great a threat to the project. Had I let him remain among us, he might have uncovered the true nature of the Vaults and jeopardized the experiment. Even if he didn't, he'd at least inspire others to venture outside, which would be just as bad.}
{333}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{334}{}{He simply had to go. There was no other option. But even that wasn't enough. No, I'm afraid the damage had already been done. I allowed his most stubborn supporters to follow him into exile, and then tried to reassert my control over those who remained. But it was no use -- I'd already been vilified. So be it. The only thing I'm guilty of is an entire lifetime of carrying out the demands of our Great Nation.}
{335}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{336}{}{My only regret is that Vault 13 is not likely to complete the social experiment. Once I've been disposed of, I feel certain the others will leave the Vault. Not right away, of course -- I've instilled too much fear in them of the outside world. But eventually, they're bound to overcome that fear. I have very little faith that Vault 13 will remained closed until 2277, as the experiment dictates.}
{337}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{338}{}{I'm afraid I have failed my duty as Overseer. I can only hope that the rest of the public Vaults involved in the Societal Preservation Program have been more successful. To my superiors, who I'm certain will one day read this: forgive me. And may God bless America.}

{360}{}{After hours of scouring through the computer's archives, you're able to locate a few hidden documents concerning the Societal Preservation Program. As you read over them, you uncover a rather disturbing truth about the Vaults: they were never intended to save the population of the United States.}
{361}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{362}{}{Incredibly, all 122 of Vault-Tec's public Vaults were part of a grand social experiment orchestrated by the US government. Only 17 of those Vaults, dubbed "control Vaults", were designed to function correctly (it seems Vault 8 was one of the lucky few). The rest were meant to have various critical flaws, so that the government could study the pre-selected occupants, and see how they react to the stresses of their situations, and how well they're able to re-colonize once their Vaults open.}
{363}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{364}{}{It seems Vault 13's role in the experiment was to remain closed for 200 years to test the effects of prolonged isolation. Apparently, the breaking down of the water chip was un-intended, and forced the Overseer to improvise by selecting your grandfather to go out and fetch a new chip. After some more digging around, you manage to find descriptions of some of other Vault experiments.}
{365}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{366}{}{Vault 12's door was designed never to close, so that the assholes behind this experiment could "study the effects of radiation on the selected population". If you recall the legend correctly, Vault 12 was located under the ghoul filled city of Necropolis, where the Vault Dweller finally found the water chip. It seems quite likely that the ghouls were the result of this experiment.}
{367}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{368}{}{Vault 15, another key location in the Vault Dweller's quest, was to be populated by people with "radically diverse ideologies" that would be sealed in the Vault together for 50 years. Vault 27 was to be purposely overcrowded with 2,000 people -- double the maximum capacity. That couldn't have been pretty. Vault 29 was to be populated only by those under the age of sixteen, with their parents "purposely redirected to other Vaults".}
{369}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{370}{}{Vault 34's experiment involved an armory overstocked with weapons and ammo, and, of course, not provided with a lock. How pleasant. Vault 36 suffered from food extruders that were designed to produce only "a thin, watery gruel", while Vault 42 was outfitted only with dim lighting--no light bulbs of over 40 watts were provided.}
{371}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{372}{}{Vault 53's equipment was designed to break down every few months. While repairable, the constant breakdowns were meant to test the stress of the inhabitants. You wonder how many expert mechanics and technicians that Vault produced. Vault 55 would have all its entertainment tapes removed, while Vault 56 would have all its entertainment tapes removed, with the exception of one featuring a particularly bad comic actor.}
{373}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{374}{}{Vault 68 was to be occupied by 999 males and only one female. You can only imagine the horrors that took place there... Vault 69, on the other hand, was to be occupied by 999 females and only one male... interesting. Vault 70's jumpsuit extruders were designed to fail after 6 months. And finally, Vault 106 was designed so that 10 days after being sealed, it would begin "releasing psychoactive drugs into the air filtration system".}
