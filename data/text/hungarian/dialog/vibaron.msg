{100}{}{You see the caravan master.}
{101}{}{You see Mr. Baron, the master of this caravan.}
{200}{}{Hello Traveler, name's Robert Baron, master of this here caravan. Are you looking to make a trade?}
{201}{}{Sure. Let's see what you've got.}
{202}{}{Actually, I wanted to speak with you on behalf of a nearby village.}
{203}{}{Nope. I'll be on my way now.}
{204}{}{Robert Baron, huh? Ever think about going by Bobby Baron? That's got a nice bounce to it, don't you think?}
{210}{}{I think your mom might've bounced you on your head a couple times. Now, do you want to trade, or not? I'm a busy man.}
{220}{}{Rendben. Bármi más?}
{221}{}{Yes actually, I wanted to speak with you on behalf of a nearby village.}
{222}{}{Nope. I'll be on my way now.}
{230}{}{[He furrows his brow.] Village? Not sure what your--oh! Are you talking about that rat infested little shit-hole down the way?}
{231}{}{Uh, maybe.}
{232}{}{De, az vagyok.}
{233}{}{It's not a shit-hole. They're a struggling community that's making some real progress.}
{240}{}{Look, I already met with them, and I'm going to tell you the same thing I told them. They're simply too small for me to bother with. Besides, that place is fetid as all hell.}
{241}{}{Alright. I gave it a shot. Bye.}
{242}{}{Oh, come on, it's not that far out of your way. You pretty much pass right by it.}
{243}{}{Is there *any* way I could get you to change your mind?}
{250}{}{Now what? If you're not going to trade, then stop wasting my fucking time.}
{251}{}{Kereskedjünk!}
{252}{}{Sorry, I'll go now.}
{253}{}{I think I'll waste *you* asshole.}
{254}{}{Is there *any* way I could get you to change your mind about trading with the village?}
{260}{}{So what if I do? I don't care if it's only a *minute* out of my way, it's just not worth the hassle.}
{261}{}{Alright. I see it's useless to reason with you. Bye.}
{262}{}{Is there *any* way I could get you to change your mind?}
{263}{}{That's too bad, because a smart merchant would jump on this opportunity. But hey, if you're not interested, I suppose I'll have to go elsewhere...}
{270}{}{Now just hold on a moment. I didn't say for certain that I wasn't interested. What's this opportunity you speak of?}
{271}{}{You see, that village might not be much to look at now, but I've got some insider information that all but guarantees that place is going to be the new hot spot. Trust me, it's going to be booming in the coming years. So if I were you, I'd want to build up relations now, before they get too big and you miss your chance.}
{280}{}{Haha! You expect me to believe that shit-hole is going to turn into something worthwhile? I think I'm about done wasting my time with you.}
{281}{}{Alright. I see it's useless to reason with you. Bye.}
{282}{}{Is there *any* way I could get you to change your mind?}
{290}{}{You're not kidding, are you? Hmm, I suppose it couldn't hurt to take a little detour over there now and then. Hell, it's hardly even out of my way. Thanks for the tip, friend.}
{291}{}{No problem. See ya.}
{292}{}{Igen. Viszlát!}
{300}{}{[He seems to consider your question.] Perhaps . . . exactly what are we talking here?}
{301}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll pay you $500.}
{302}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll do my part to ensure nothing "unfortunate" happens to your caravan.}
{303}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll show you a good time you'll never forget.}
{304}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, my wife here will show you a good time you'll never forget.}
{305}{}{Actually, never mind. Bye.}
{310}{}{Now you're speaking my language! Alright, it's a deal. [He greedily snatches the money from you and shakes your hand.]}
{311}{}{Pleasure doing business with you. Bye.}
{312}{}{Viszlát!}
{320}{}{$500? Not worth it. Make it $1,000 and you've got a deal.}
{321}{}{I don't have that much. Bye.}
{322}{}{Alright, fine. $1,000 it is.}
{323}{}{No deal. Goodbye.}
{330}{}{Now you're speaking my language! You've got yourself a deal. [He greedily snatches the money from you and shakes your hand.]}
{331}{}{Pleasure doing business with you. Bye.}
{332}{}{Viszlát!}
{340}{}{Are you threatening me? No one threatens me and lives! (to his caravan guards) Kill this stupid fuck!}
{341}{}{Akkor hadd szóljon!}
{350}{}{Look, I don't want any trouble. If you want me to swing by and trade with that village, fine, no big deal. Hell, it's hardly even out of my way. No problem.}
{351}{}{I'm glad we have an understanding. I'll be watching you. Bye.}
{352}{}{You better hope there's not a problem. Cause if there is, I'll solve it. Bye.}
{353}{}{[Glare at him intently for a moment, then slowly walk away.]}
{360}{}{Ugh! God no! I'd rather fuck a brahmin. Now get out of here and stop wasting my time.}
{361}{}{Fuck you, asshole! [Attack.]}
{362}{}{Fine, but you could've just said no. No need to be a jerk about it.}
{363}{}{You don't know what you're missing.}
{364}{}{[Bury your ugly face in your hands and run away crying.]}
{370}{}{Eh, sorry girl. I'm just not in the mood right now. You got anything else to offer?}
{371}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll pay you $500.}
{372}{}{You make that village a regular stop on your route, and in return, I'll do my part to ensure nothing "unfortunate" happens to your caravan.}
{373}{}{Nem. Pá!}
{380}{}{[He looks you up and down, then grins.] I think you've got yourself a deal. Do you take it in the backdoor?}
{381}{}{Baby, I take it any way you want to give it.}
{382}{}{You'll just have to find out, won't you?}
{383}{}{Ugh! Hell no! Now let's hurry up and get this over with before I puke.}
{390}{}{[The merchant grins at you as he refastens his belt.] Holy shit, you sure know how to drive a good bargain. If you ever need to talk a merchant into doing something else, you make sure and look me up. Now, I should really be going. It was a pleasure doing business with you.}
{391}{}{[Shudder.] Once was enough. Bye.}
{392}{}{Anytime. Bye.}
{393}{}{Viszlát!}
{400}{}{[He looks Miria up and down, then grins.] I think you've got yourself a deal. [He shakes your hand, then puts his arm around Miria and walks her to someplace more private.]}
{401}{}{[Tap your foot while you wait.]}
{402}{}{[Whistle while you wait.]}
{403}{}{[Check your weapons while you wait.]}
{404}{}{[Stand there silently and make awkward eye contact with the caravan guards while you listen to the sounds of your wife being defiled by the merchant master.]}
{410}{}{[An hour later, you see Robert Baron and Miria, now sweaty and disheveled from their sexual romp, walking back towards you. You notice Miria is walking with a slight limp. The merchant grins at you as he refastens his belt.] Holy shit, you sure know how to drive a good bargain. If you ever need to talk a merchant into doing something else, you make sure and look me up. Now, I should really be going. It was a pleasure doing business with you.}
{411}{}{Jól van, oké. Na, csá!}
{412}{}{Anytime. Bye.}
{413}{}{Viszlát!}
{500}{}{You convince the merchant to add the village to his trade route.}
{510}{}{You kill the merchant, thus ensuring that the village won't be able to trade.}
