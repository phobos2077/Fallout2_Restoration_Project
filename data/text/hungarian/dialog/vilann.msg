{100}{}{Egy fiatal nőt látsz.}
{101}{}{You see Ann, Connar's wife.}
{102}{}{She appears to be busily cooking.}
{200}{}{Why hello there, I'm Connar's wife, Ann. You must be the one who helped us out. I can't tell you how much
 we appreciate all you've done. It's hard to believe that we can finally live in peace without fear of Vault City's goons
 coming to take us from our homes.}
{201}{}{Glad to be of assistance. You seem to be quite busy here. Need some help with anything?}
{202}{}{No problem. See you around.}
{300}{}{Actually, I *could* use some help. Now that we're becoming more organized, we're starting to see our numbers
 grow. The problem is, I'm not sure we'll have enough food to go around. My husband has attempted to get the caravans
 to stop here, but they don't' think we're worth their time. I don't suppose you could get them to reconsider?}
{301}{}{Sorry lady, but I think I've done enough here. I need to move on now. Bye.}
{302}{}{Can't you people ever deal with your own fucking problems? Bye.}
{303}{}{Sure. I'll see what I can do. Who do I talk to about this?}
{310}{}{One of the caravan masters, Mr. Baron, will be passing by here shortly. The caravan trail isn't far from this
 village. If you could go out there and meet with him, we'd all appreciate it greatly.}
{311}{}{Alright, I'll give it a shot. Show me where he is.}
{312}{}{Alright, but I'm not ready yet. I'll let you know when I am.}
{313}{}{On second thought, you're going to have to handle this on your own. Sorry.}
{320}{}{Are you ready to go meet the caravan master yet?}
{321}{}{Not yet. Bye.}
{322}{}{Alright. I'm ready.}
{330}{}{Oh, it's you! Thank you for speaking with Mr. Baron. He had just come by to make trade arrangements with my husband.
 You've done so much to help us, we're forever in your debt!}
{331}{}{It's the least I could do. Take care.}
{332}{}{You think I do all this for free? Let's talk money.}
{340}{}{[Ann looks a bit flustered.] Well, yes... alright fine. I had a little something stored away for an emergency, but
 I suppose you can have it. And to think I saw you as a good person.}
{341}{}{Looks are in the eyes of the beholder, lady. Good day.}
{342}{}{Sorry, money makes the world go round. Bye.}
{350}{}{Oh, it's you! I heard what you did to Mr. Baron. I never did care for him, but you didn't have to kill him. We'll
 stifle as a community without proper trade.}
{351}{}{Sorry, mistakes happen. Bye.}
{352}{}{Not my problem. Bye.}
{353}{}{You don't need to worry about any damn merchants. Because I plan on killing the whole lot of you.}
{400}{}{Did Vault City send you?}
{401}{}{We have the right to live here, you know.}
{402}{}{Nincs több mondanivalóm a számodra.}
{403}{}{Thanks again for everything!}
{404}{}{Thanks so much!}
{405}{}{Finally we are safe.}
{406}{}{Thanks for everything! Be sure to stop by again once we expand the place. I'll finally have a working kitchen to cook in.}
{410}{}{Üdv minálunk.}
{411}{}{You seem to be quite busy here. Need some help with anything?}
{412}{}{Nem fontos! Üdv!}
{420}{}{How did it go?}
{421}{}{How did what go? Oh, the merchant. Actually, I lost interest with him and wandered off.}
{430}{}{What!? You realize this was our last chance to make arragements with him. We look like fools now standing him up.
 You've doomed us.}
{431}{}{Sorry, mistakes happen. Bye.}
{432}{}{Not my problem. Bye.}
{433}{}{You don't need to worry about any damn merchants. Because I plan on killing the whole lot of you.}
{500}{}{You convinced the merchant to add the village to his trade route.}
{510}{}{You killed the merchant, thus ensuring that the village won't be able to trade.}
{511}{}{You fail to convince the merchant to add the village to his trade route.}
