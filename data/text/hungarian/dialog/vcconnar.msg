{100}{}{Egy koszos, izmos férfit látsz.}
{101}{}{Connar-t látod.}
{102}{}{Hey you! What're you doing here?!}
{103}{}{Ne mozdulj vándor! Mit keresel itt?}
{104}{}{I'm killing off all these mole rats.}
{105}{}{Miért? Mit ártottak neked?}
{106}{}{Mert csak!}
{107}{}{I bet those bastards at Vault City sent you. Well, you best be off, and leave everything else alive.}
{108}{}{Hát, ezzel elkéstél.}
{109}{}{Miért?}
{110}{}{Bocs, de a munka az munka.}
{111}{}{Those creatures are the only thing stopping Vault City from making us their so-called "servants".}
{112}{}{Look, they're paying me to get rid of these beasts, so that's what I'm gonna do.}
{113}{}{Erről nem szóltak.}
{114}{}{Fizetnek, hogy kipucoljam a helyet. Már végeztem is velük.}
{115}{}{Te idióta! Mi a francért csináltad ezt?}
{116}{}{Kellett a pénz.}
{117}{}{Ugye tudod, hogy elvisznek minket, ha megteszed?}
{118}{}{Nem az én bajom.}
{119}{}{Akkor dögölj meg! Hamarosan jönnek értünk.}
{120}{}{Nem tudtam, hogy ezért olyan fontos nekik.}
{121}{}{Aha, persze. Különben sem tárgyalok ilyen szar alakkal, mint te.}
{122}{}{Bocs, de nem hagyhatjuk.}
{123}{}{Tedd amit tenned kell.}
{124}{}{Megvettek kilóra? Még sokat kell tanulnod a világról, barátom.}
{125}{}{Van valami, amiben segíthetnék?}
{126}{}{A menedékvárosi srácok elég beszariak. Csinálsz egy-két figurát és már futnak is a hegyekbe. Ha lenne pár lőfegyverünk, azt hiszem, elbírnánk velük.}
{127}{}{I might be able to help you out, but guns aren't cheap. What sort of guns you looking for?}
{128}{}{[He eyes you with a tentative grin.] You're serious about helping us, aren't you? Alright, if you're up for it,
 then some rifles would be ideal--that way we could start picking them off from a distance. So if you truly wanna help,
 then bring us some automatic rifles--four would do it. Oh, and a shotgun would be nice too, in case things get close and dirty.}
{129}{}{I'll see what I can do. But like I said, guns aren't cheap, so I'm gonna need some money.}
{130}{}{Nem vagy közénk való. Tünj el!}
{131}{}{Meggondoltam magam. Tudok segíteni?}
{132}{}{Aha, a legjobb ha minél hamarabb lelépsz.}
{133}{}{Aggódom.}
{134}{}{Hát visszajöttél! Sikerült fegyvereket szerezned?}
{135}{}{Mi kell már megint?}
{136}{}{Ja, itt vannak.}
{137}{}{We need four assault rifles and a shotgun. The sooner you can get them to us, the better.}
{138}{}{Oké.}
{139}{}{Alright! With these babies, we should able to make something of this place over the next couple months. Thanks a
 lot, and hey, if you ever need a place to rest, you'll always be welcome here, friend.}
{140}{}{Szóra sem érdemes.}
{141}{}{Hello! Things are going well. We're going to work on expanding the Village in the next month.}
{142}{}{Üdv újra. Jól mennek a dolgok, mint látod. Nézz körül, ha van időd!}
{143}{}{Még mindig épitkezünk. Ha minden jól megy, jövő hónapban megemeljük a falakat.}
{144}{}{Greetings! The village has expanded again, just as we've hoped. Of course, you're welcome as always.}
{145}{}{We no longer have anything to fear from Vault City--it looks like we'll be able to live here in peace. Thanks again, wanderer.}
{146}{}{Csak ne gyilkolássz itt semmit, te gyökér!}
{147}{}{What the hell have you done?!?! You fucking traitor! I hate you!!!}
{148}{}{Oooooops...}
{149}{}{Let me out of here!!!}
{150}{}{Mi rosszat tettem?}
{151}{}{Segítség!}
{152}{}{Of course. Here, this is all we can afford. [He hands you $5,000.] I might be a damn fool for trusting it to a
 stranger, but you're the only hope we've got of staying free. Speak to Old Joe in Vault City's courtyard. He's usually
 in or around the bar. He'll know what to do.}
{153}{}{Már megyek is.}
{154}{}{Feltehetnék egy-két futó kérdést?}
{155}{}{Certainly, what's on your mind?}
{156}{}{Where did these mole rats come from, and why aren't they aggressive?}
{157}{}{Nothing, bye.}
{158}{}{Well, it's kind of a strange story. You see, a bunch of ghouls came here one day, mumbling something about a "renewal",
 and giving out these funky amulets. [He shows you an Ankh shaped amulet.] These big rodents came with em, and the ghouls said
 they'd be protecting us from now on. The ghouls left--probably back up to Gecko--but the rodents stayed put, and they've
 been here ever since. Like I said, it's pretty strange stuff. It's kind of a pain to clean up after these things, but hell,
 if they keep Vault City off our ass, then I suppose I can put up with a little rat shit.}
{159}{}{Very interesting. Do you think I could have one of those amulets?}
{160}{}{By all means. They gave us so many, and we don't know what the hell to do with em. Here, take one.}
{161}{}{Thanks a lot. Bye.}
{162}{}{No, but I've got some great news: I convinced the Vault City council not to touch your village.}
{163}{}{What? They're seriously going to just leave us alone? I don't understand... how did you that? I swear if you're bullshitting me...}
{164}{}{It's true--trust me. I was able to pull some strings and broker a deal, but the details don't matter. The important thing is that you and your people are safe now.}
{165}{}{Thank you from the bottom of my heart... em... By the way, I still don't know your name.}
{166}{}{My name is - }
{167}{}{Thank you, }
{168}{}{, but what about the money I gave you to buy the guns?}
{169}{}{You are always welcome here! Goodbye.}
{170}{}{Yes, but I don't think you're gonna need them. At least not against Vault City. You see, I've convinced the Vault City council not to touch your village.}
{171}{}{I'll do it. I have some questions before I go though.}
{172}{}{Nem fontos! Üdv!}
{173}{}{Not yet. I'll return when I have them.}
{174}{}{Thanks! See you around.}
{200}{}{It just so happens that I've already got what you need right here.}
{201}{}{As it turns out, I'm already carrying all those guns. I suppose I could spare a few, but are you sure this is the best way to go about this?}
{202}{}{I've got the guns you need, but honestly, I think there could be a better way to do this. There's a reasonable man on the council in Vault City, Senior Council Member McClure. I'm sure I could get him to convince the council to come to a peaceful solution.}
{203}{}{Honestly, I think there could be a better way to do this. There's a reasonable man on the council in Vault City, Senior Council Member McClure. I'm sure I could get him to convince the council to come to a peaceful solution.}
{205}{}{Ha! You really think any of those big shot council members give a damn about what happens to us? Don't be so naive my friend, those bastards in Vault City can't be trusted. Now please, go find Joe in the Vault City courtyard. If he's not in the bar, then he's probably not far from it. Old Joe will know what to do. You can trust him. Please hurry.}
{206}{}{Ok. I'll report back when I have some news.}
{210}{}{Trust me, we've considered the alternative, but the only thing these Vault City bastards will respond to is violence. Now, will you give us the weapons? I'll pay $5,000 for em. No price can be set on freedom.}
{211}{}{You do?! Excellent. Here, I'll give you $5,000 for those weapons. It's all the money we have, but there's no price too high for freedom. You've done us a great service, and shall always be welcome here.}
{212}{}{Alright. Here are the weapons.}
{213}{}{No, I have decided not to. Goodbye.}
{214}{}{No price too high, eh? Well, I know how economics work. Increase in demand means an increase in prices.}
{215}{}{[DONE]}
{216}{}{[ATTACK]}
{217}{}{Listen, starting a war with Vault City isn't the answer. Sure, you might be able to fend them off for months, maybe even years, but you can't hold out forever. And in the meantime, lives will be needlessly lost. But if I can just get one member of the Vault City council to see reason, then I know we can reach a peaceful agreement.}
{218}{}{Hmm... Alright, I trust you have our best interests in mind. If you really think you can reason with one of their council members, then by all means, give it a shot. However, I think you should talk to Old Joe and see what he has to say. You can find him in or around the courtyard bar. Good luck. We're all counting on you.}
{220}{}{I shoulda known you'd be another heartless opportunist. It's people like you that we started this community to try and get away from. You know what? Forget it. We don't need the help of someone like you. Now I suggest you leave.}
{221}{}{I shoulda known you'd be another heartless opportunist. It's people like you that we started this community to try and get away from. [He sighs.] Fine, we'll throw in an extra thousand, but that leaves us with nothing. Will you give us the guns now?}
{222}{}{Sure, pleasure doing business with you. Bye.}
{223}{}{Actually, I think I can find a better deal elsewhere. Goodbye.}
{225}{}{Excellent. Here, I'll give you $5,000 for those weapons. It's all the money we have, but there's no price too high for freedom. You've done us a great service, and shall always be welcome here.}
{226}{}{Alright, take care then.}
{300}{}{Any news on our dilemma?}
{301}{}{Not yet. I'll report back when I find something.}
{302}{}{Good news: I've convinced the Vault City council not to touch your village.}
{310}{}{If you're willing to part with those weapons you're carrying, we're willing to pay you $5,000 for them.}
{311}{}{You've got yourself a deal. Here's the weapons.}
{312}{}{No deal. It's a dangerous world out there and I need all the guns I can get my hands on. Goodbye.}
{400}{}{Thanks friend. With these weapons we stand a chance!}
{401}{}{Welcome back. Thanks to you we were successful in pushing back the Vault City patrol. They won't be bothering us anymore.}
{500}{}{Ne zaklass!}
{600}{}{What was the name of your contact in Vault City again?}
{601}{}{Old Joe. As the name implies, he's a real old fella. You'll either find him in the courtyard bar or wandering nearby.}
{602}{}{Oké, kösz az infót.}
{603}{}{So, who exactly is he?}
{604}{}{Old Joe's a real character, is who he is. Claims to be over a hundred years old, but I dunno if I buy it. He claims all sorts of things. Even says he helped save the world once. The guy's full of stories--I reckon most of em are bullshit, but they sure are entertaining. He keeps an eye on things in Vault City for us, and he does a damn fine job considering he's old as dirt and nearly blind.}
{605}{}{Interesting. I must be going.}
{606}{}{He says he helped save the world? You know, I'm kind of on a world saving quest myself--at least a quest to save *my* world.}
{610}{}{Right. Good for you. Well, you keep at it then. Just don't forget about helping us.}
{611}{}{Oh I won't. See you later.}
{612}{}{I probably will, actually. I get so many quests it's hard to keep track. If it wasn't for this handy Pip-Boy, who knows where I'd be? See ya.}
{700}{}{Oh, right. Here you go. [Hand him $5,000.]}
{701}{}{Sorry, I had to spend it as part of the deal.}
{702}{}{Shit, I don't have enough to pay you back. I must've spent some without thinking about it. I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.}
{710}{}{Thanks. Here. [He hands you back $2,500.] Keep it. It's the least we could do to repay you.}
{720}{}{Oh, I see. Well, if it bought us our freedom, then it was worth every coin. Thanks again for all you've done for us.}
{730}{}{Tell you what--how 'bout you just pay us back half? Do you have $2,500?}
{731}{}{Sure, here. [You give him $2,500.]}
{732}{}{Sorry, I don't even have that much.}
{740}{}{Thank you, }
{741}{}{. We won't forget what you've done for us.}
{750}{}{I see . . . well, don't worry about it. The money isn't as important as our freedom. Thank you.}
