{100}{}{You see a Hologram.}
{101}{}{You see the Director of Operations.}
{102}{}{Hologram 12001. He directs operations within the EPA.}
{200}{}{[This weasely looking hologram regards you with a nervous smile.] Hello, welcome to the EPA. You may have noticed that we're experiencing some mild issues, but we'll cross that bridge once we come to it.}
{201}{}{Uh, OK. Who are you?}
{210}{}{I'm the Director of Operations for the EPA.}
{211}{}{Oh, right. [You scratch your head] What does that actually mean?}
{220}{}{[He chuckles uneasily.] Why, I coordinate things. Get the ball rolling. Now it's in your court. I like to bring out the best in people. Here at the EPA, that's what it's all about. Honestly. Integrity. Thank you, we value your opinion.}
{221}{}{Mi a fenérõl beszélsz?}
{230}{}{I assure you that we are working diligently to resolve all issues. We've had a bit of downsizing, but things are looking up. I feel confident that all quotas will be achieved in due time.}
{231}{}{What quotas? You're not making any sense. Do you actually do anything here? Can you help me, or not?}
{240}{}{That all depends on your outlook. My hands are tied on this matter, but I'd be delighted to assist you if you could.}
{241}{}{Felejtse el! Üdv!}
{242}{}{I'm sorry I couldn't be of further assistance.}
{243}{}{Thank you for your time.}
{244}{}{I don't want to comment.}
{245}{}{No comment.}
{246}{}{I would, but I'm currently authoratally challenged.}
{247}{}{We'll tackle that issue once we come to it.}
{248}{}{This meeting is for discussion, not for action.}
{249}{}{I'm confident the EPA is on track for success.}
{250}{}{That issue's relevancy is in question.}
{251}{}{Let's not be hasty, lest we act too quick.}
{252}{}{That sounds adequate.}
{253}{}{I understand your concern.}
