{102}{}{You see a merchant who is trying to fix the waterpump.}
{103}{}{I just can't get this thing working!}
{104}{}{This seems to be very hard to fix.}
{105}{}{What a piece of shit this is!}
{106}{}{Stubborn little sonnuva bitch are we?}
{107}{}{Could you lend me a hand?}
{108}{}{Maybe you'll have better luck with this.}
{109}{}{Hey, thanks for fixing the waterpump!}
{110}{}{You should notify the headmonk that the waterpump is now fixed.}
{200}{}{Thanks for helping us with this thing.}
{300}{}{Ah, what a piece of shi- umm, I'm a little busy right now. Do you need something or are
 you just wasting my time?}
{301}{}{Actually yes, the Abbot sent me. He said the water pump is having some trouble.}
{302}{}{Heh, "having trouble" is an understatement. This ol' thing is totally busted. There's no way
 it's going to run again.}
{303}{}{I see. Then I guess it wouldn't hurt anything if I took a look at it.}
{304}{}{Sure, be my guest. Not like you could break it any more.}
{305}{}{I don't mean to bother, but what seems to be the trouble here?}
{306}{}{The main water pump for the Abbey is busted. The damn thing was breathing its last the past few days
 and now it's finally gone out.}
{307}{}{I'm a bit of a techie, mind if I take a look?}
{308}{}{Well, I'm not that great with machines, but perhaps I can see if something can be done.}
{309}{}{Sure, no one's stopping you.}
{310}{}{Uh, sorry. Bye.}
{311}{}{I'll see what I can do then.}
{312}{}{I thought I might be able to help, but if you want to be an asshole about it, then you're welcome to figure it out on your own.}
{313}{}{I told the Abbot I'd be willing to help, but if you want to be an asshole about it, then you're welcome to figure it out on your own.}
{320}{}{[He squints at you for a moment, then slowly lets out his breath in a sigh.] Sorry friend, this thing's being a
 real bitch, and it's gotten me all worked up. I didn't mean to snap at ya. }
{321}{}{Well, what seems to be the problem then?}
{322}{}{Na, persze... szia.}
{330}{}{Come back and talk to me in the morning.}
{400}{}{Oh, it's you again. Any luck?}
{401}{}{No, not yet. I'll get back to you if I do.}
{402}{}{Actually, yes. I looked inside and it seems the motor is completely busted. The connections are shot, so we're
 going to have to get our hands on a new motor, as well as some wires to reconnect everything since the old wires are fried.}
{500}{}{Hmm... the connectors are shot on the main motor, eh? Well, I got some wires here with me that will work, but not
 that specific motor. I am sure Vault City has the part though. Go there and speak with Harry in the main courtyard. Tell him
 Dave sent you. Damn motor is expensive, but he should give you a good deal.}
{501}{}{I'll head there now. Be back soon.}
{502}{}{Whoa, hold on a second. I was happy to help you figure out the problem, but who said I'm willing to trek across
 the wastes to go buy you an expensive motor? If you want my help, it's going to cost you.}
{503}{}{How 'bout *you* tell Harry that when you go fetch it your damn self? I'm not your fucking errand boy. Bye.}
{510}{}{Alright, I wouldn't expect someone to do work for free. The part will cost you bout 500 and I think 100 more for
 your trouble is reasonable. Here's 600.}
{511}{}{That's better. I'll be back with the part.}
{600}{}{Any luck on that part? This machine won't fix itself.}
{601}{}{No, not yet. I'll be back when I get it.}
{602}{}{Yep, got the part right here.}
{700}{}{Excellent. Want me to install the damn thing, or do you want the pleasure?}
{701}{}{I think I can handle it. Step aside.}
{702}{}{Actually, I think I've done enough on this job. Go ahead and install it yourself.}
{800}{}{Alright fine, hand it over.}
{801}{}{Tessék.}
{900}{}{That should do it.}
{901}{}{The water pump has been repaired.}
{910}{}{(Wipes the sweat from his forehead.) Yeah, need something?}
{911}{}{The Abbot said you might need some assistance. What seems to be the trouble?}
{912}{}{Felejtse el. Viszlátásra.}
{913}{}{I took a look at the water pump and it seems the motor is completely busted. The connections are shot, so we're
 going to have to get our hands on a new motor, as well as some wires to reconnect everything since the old wires are fried.}
