{100}{}{Egy köpcös, jól tápált Shi férfihez van szerencséd.}
{101}{}{Ő Dr. Wong Yi Tze.}
{102}{}{Egy köpcös, jól tápált Shi férfihez van szerencséd.}
{103}{}{Segítséget nyújthatok önnek, kérem?}
{104}{}{Daghi nu?}
{105}{}{Te vagyol ki?}
{106}{}{Úgy hallottam, magánál van egy illető lépe.}
{107}{}{Ki vagy?}
{108}{}{Mit csinálsz itt?}
{109}{}{Nem, köszönöm. Ez minden.}
{110}{}{Meg kell vallanom valamit. Nem beszélem az ön nyelvét. Talán Ken Leevel kéne beszélnie, ő nagyon sokféle nyelvet megért.}
{111}{}{Agh!}
{112}{}{Dr. Wong vagyok. Én vagyok e létesítmény vezető tudósa.}
{113}{}{Kérem, még kérdeznék.}
{114}{}{Köszönöm. Viszlát!}
{115}{}{Az általunk folytatott kísérleteket felügyelem. Ezenkívül a számítógép-hálózatért is én felelek.}
{116}{}{Mik a tervei?}
{117}{}{Hogy tud az ember hozzáférni a számítógép-hálózathoz?}
{118}{}{Volna még néhány egyéb kérdésem.}
{119}{}{Értem. Viszlát!}
{120}{}{Ah, abban az esetben, ha elmondom önnek a terveimet, mindenki tisztában lesz velük. Attól tartok, egyelőre titokban tartom őket.}
{121}{}{Remek, remek. Van még néhány kérdésem.}
{122}{}{Köszönöm. Viszlát!}
{123}{}{Mi lenne, ha egy puskacsövet nyomnék az orra alá és úgy szedném ki magából?}
{124}{}{Az ember megtanulja, hogy kell behatolni a rendszerbe, hogyan kell összebratyizni valamelyik beosztottammal. Természetesen csak viccelek. Ha ilyesmit akarna tenni, magára küldenék valakit, hogy ölje meg. [mosolyog, jelezvén, hogy nem akar megbántani ezzel.]}
{125}{}{Maga tényleg megölne engem?}
{126}{}{Szóval nem lenne komoly kifogása az ellen, hogy rákattanjak a számítógépre?}
{127}{}{Volna még néhány kérdésem.}
{128}{}{Hát persze. Viszlát!}
{129}{}{Fenyegetésnek venném és figyelmeztetném, hogy ez megárthat az egészségének.}
{130}{}{Tegyünk egy próbát!}
{131}{}{Csak poénkodtam. Inkább kérdeznék valami mást.}
{132}{}{[mosolyog] Meg kell védenünk a becsületünket, idegen.}
{133}{}{Öö, hogyne. Szóval nem lenne ellenére, ha rákattannék a számítógépre?}
{134}{}{Úúúúgy van. Hadd kérdezzek még!}
{135}{}{Le merném fogadni. Viszlát!}
{136}{}{Ha meg tudja győzni a beosztottaimat... üsse kő.}
{137}{}{Mi lenne, ha egy fegyert dugnék az orra alá?}
{138}{}{Nagyszerű! Hát, még kérdeznék, ha nem gond.}
{139}{}{Hmm. Értem. Hát akkor viszlát!}
{140}{}{Ahh, yes! Indeed. I will prepare it with fava beans and a nice Chianti.}
{141}{}{Még megvan magának? Remek. Chip már epedve várja.}
{142}{}{Az egy emberi lép, maga beteg állat!}
{143}{}{Azt ugye tudja, hogy ehhez májat kell felszolgálni, nem lépet?}
{144}{}{Tudja... az egy emberi lép.}
{145}{}{Ki ez a Chip? A lép az enyém és meg fogom enni vacsorára.}
{146}{}{Chip a lép eredeti tulajdonosa. Részeg volt és eladta Lao Chounak.}
{147}{}{Az a helyzet, hogy szeretne életben maradni, ezért vissza akarja kapni. Belőle származik ugyebár.}
{148}{}{Akkor esetleg megölöm magát, hogy visszakapjam.}
{149}{}{Az üzet az üzlet. Jobb lesz, ha búcsút int a lépének. Sajnálom, de mi megegyeztünk és az, hogy Chip megbánást tanúsít, nem jelenti, hogy vissza lehet táncolni az üzlettől.}
{150}{}{[TOVÁBBI LEHETŐSÉG]}
{151}{}{Az egy emberi lép? La Chou ezt nem említette!}
{152}{}{Ennek ellenére, a hírvivő kíméletlensége miatt, azt hiszem, a megállapodáshoz fogom tartani a feleket. Kísérleteket fogok végezni azon a lépen.}
{153}{}{Mondja el a barátjának, hogy holnapig jöjjön érte, és akkor örömmel visszaadom. Remélem, megtalálja a módját, hogy időben visszakerüljön a testébe.}
{154}{}{Jól van.}
{155}{}{Ha ha! Yes, I too saw that old movie. Wait... what are you saying? Are you saying that...?}
{156}{}{Igen, az bizony egy emberi lép.}
{157}{}{Igazság szerint ellenkeznék ezzel. Maga nem bizonyult jó embernek. Azt sem tudom, miért beszélek magával egyáltalán. Minden jót!}
{158}{}{[RENDBEN]}
{159}{}{Aijjj! Őrség! Itt van a lao wai behatoló!}
{160}{}{Vannak vázlatai, amit odaadna nekem?}
{161}{}{Ken Lee mondta nekem, hogy adjam ezeket magának.}
{162}{}{Igen. Mit kapok cserébe?}
{163}{}{Nem, még nem.}
{164}{}{Beszéljen Ken Leevel! Megtárgyalhatják, mi legyen a jövőjével. Köszönöm. Ezzel képesek leszünk ellenőrizni a tesztadataink egy részét. Minden jót!}
{165}{}{Az a helyzet, hogy volna még más kérdésem.}
{166}{}{Viszlát!}
{200}{}{I found this corpse stashed over at the Hubologists' base. I believe it might be your missing Xeno Project specimen.}
{201}{}{Yes, it is indeed! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this specimen. Thank you for retrieving this.}
{202}{}{No problem. See you later.}
{203}{}{Hold on there. No one said I did this for free.}
{204}{}{Correct. Nor did anyone ask you to retrieve the subject. You did that and brought it here of your own volition. Now the stolen subject has been returned to its rightful owners, and we thank you for it.}
{205}{}{That's nice, but I found it, so if you want it back, then it's going to cost you.}
{206}{}{I don't have time for this... Guards!}
{207}{}{[The man looks like he is about to yell, then calms down.] Fine. Here is $500. More than enough for something
 that always belonged to us. Now leave, I'm a busy man.}
{208}{}{Pleasure doing business with you. Bye.}
{209}{}{Ó, a fenébe!}
{210}{}{Let's dance!}
{211}{}{You recover the missing Xeno Program specimen.}
{220}{}{So where is it then? Are you trying to play games with me?}
{221}{}{Sorry, I like to try and hoard as many items as I can. It's kinda my thing.}
{230}{}{I don't have time for this. Come back when you have the specimen.}
{240}{}{[He sniffs the air.] What is that smell? Like rotten meat. [He looks at you and raises an eyebrow.]}
{241}{}{Oh, you must be smelling this body I found. I'm not really sure why I'm carrying it around, to be honest.}
{242}{}{Huh-huh! [You pull out the decomposing corpse] Stinky body! U want?}
{250}{}{Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this subject. Thank you.}
{251}{}{No, I do not want-- Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in . . . [He notices your blank stare.] Ahem. I mean, thank you for the body. Good job. Don't bring any more though. This is enough. Bye now!}
{252}{}{Bye Bye!}
{253}{}{Me hoard tings. Me hide it.}
{300}{}{So what's the deal with this Dr. Sheng?}
{310}{}{How do you know about Dr. Sheng? Eh, I suppose it doesn't matter. Dr. Sheng Ming was a brilliant, but rather unpleasant man who served as my predecessor. He is no longer of any great relevance here.}
{311}{}{Well if he's not relevant to you, then why should *I* care? Let me ask you something else.}
{312}{}{So what happened to him?}
{320}{}{What happened? I'd say he lost his mind. During his experiments he stumbled upon something which I admit was rather remarkable, but it was also extremely dangerous and in no way related to the goals of the Shi. But that did not matter to Dr. Sheng. He became obsessed with his creation and since his experiments were deemed too dangerous to continue here, he decided to take them elsewhere. He left on sabbatical and never returned. That is when I stepped up to fill his position.}
{321}{}{What kind of experiments was Dr. Sheng performing? And what exactly was his big discovery?}
{322}{}{So where is Dr. Sheng now?}
{330}{}{As a man of science, I respect your inquisitive nature. However, I'm afraid I am not willing to share the secrets of the Shi with you, stranger.}
{331}{}{So where is Dr. Sheng now?}
{332}{}{Fine, you keep your fancy secrets. I have secrets of my own, you know. Better secrets than you could ever possibly imagine.}
{340}{}{[He smiles politely.] I'm sure you do. Now if you will excuse me, I have plenty of work that needs doing. Good day.}
{341}{}{[RENDBEN]}
{350}{}{Dr. Sheng was escorted a day or so to the south. He took up residence in some abandoned home, if I'm not mistaken. He was only supposed to be gone for a month, but it's been much longer and we have yet to hear from him. If I were to guess, I would say he was either destroyed by his own creations, or else fell victim to the numerous hazards of the wasteland.}
{351}{}{One of your lead scientists could be dead, and you don't care? You're not even going to go look into it?}
{352}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{353}{}{Well, that's that. Let me ask you something else.}
{360}{}{You'll have to excuse me for seeming so callous about the matter. The truth is, Dr. Sheng was not very popular around here and I do not believe any of us miss him in the slightest.}
{361}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{362}{}{Értem. Talán akkor kérdezősködnék más felől is.}
{370}{}{I suppose I could... I must admit I am somewhat curious to learn of his fate. Here, I'll mark Dr. Sheng's last known location on your mapping device. But I must warn you that it could prove to be highly dangerous. Of course, it is always dangerous out there in the wastes. Anyway, if you find something of interest, do let me know.}
{371}{}{Thanks, I'll do that. Bye.}
{372}{}{Hadd kérdezzek valami mást!}
{380}{}{Dr. Sheng is still alive and he's created some kind of plant that takes root in and controls human corpses.}
{390}{}{So he has achieved some success with his Xeno Project. How fascinating ... and disturbing. We put an end to his sentient plant experiments here after we lost one our techs. When he left to continue his research, I assumed he'd fall victim to his own creations. Has he managed to assume some form of control over them?}
{391}{}{Yeah, some of them seem to be subservient. They even refer to him as 'master.'}
{400}{}{Hmm... If he were to somehow establish an army of those plant-creatures, that would not bode well for the Shi. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but it seems we have no choice but to ensure that Dr. Sheng and his experiments are eliminated. Since he trusts you enough to allow you get close to him, you are the best candidate. Is that something you'd be willing to do? You would be compensated, of course.}
{401}{}{It'd be a pleasure. The guy and his whole operation creeps me out.}
{402}{}{What kind of compensation are we talking here?}
{403}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem--you guys can deal with him.}
{410}{}{The Shi will be most grateful for this service. Once Dr. Sheng and all of his creations have been eliminated, report back to me to receive your reward.}
{411}{}{[RENDBEN]}
{420}{}{I'll leave that up to you. We could grant you weapons, supplies, or money. You may decide once the task is complete.}
{421}{}{All right. I'll do it.}
{422}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem--you guys can deal with him.}
{423}{}{All right. I'll do it. But before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{430}{}{Fair enough. We will handle the problem ourselves, but it will have to wait, as we don't have the resources to expend at the moment. Hopefully it won't be too late once we are able to act. In the meantime, if you should change your mind, please let me know.}
{431}{}{Don't count on it. Bye.}
{432}{}{I'll think about it. Bye.}
{433}{}{We'll see. Let me ask you something else.}
{440}{}{I don't suppose you have changed your mind? Will you help us eliminate Dr. Sheng and his creations?}
{441}{}{Nope, I actually wanted to ask you about something else.}
{442}{}{Alright, I'll take him out for you.}
{443}{}{I'll do it, but for a price. You were talking about compensation before?}
{450}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind... Anyway, you may claim your reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{451}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind... Anyway, we never asked you to get so involved, but we are grateful. For your troubles, you may claim a reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{452}{}{I'll take weapons.}
{453}{}{I could always use more supplies.}
{454}{}{Just give me money.}
{455}{}{Keep your reward. I only did it because it was the right thing to do.}
{460}{}{Here you go. [He hands you various high powered weapons]}
{461}{}{[RENDBEN]}
{470}{}{Here you go. [He hands you various supplies]}
{471}{}{[RENDBEN]}
{480}{}{Here you go. [He hands you $5,000]}
{481}{}{[RENDBEN]}
{490}{}{The Shi appreciates your assistance. Now, I have much work to do. Good day.}
{491}{}{[RENDBEN]}
{500}{}{Before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{501}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{502}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to give you this plant sample as a gift, but I thought I should warn you that it's infused with his sentience serum. I don't know what it's supposed to do, but I'm pretty sure it won't be good for the Shi.}
{510}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. Now if there is nothing else, I should be getting back to work.}
{511}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. But I thought you were going to eliminate Dr. Sheng, not be his courier? In any case, I should be getting back to work.}
{512}{}{Actually, I would like to ask you something else.}
{513}{}{Viszlát!}
{514}{}{Actually, I went through quite a bit of trouble to get that sample for you. I think it's worth a reward.}
{520}{}{Do you, now? The Shi did not solicit this plant sample from you, but if you feel your deeds have earned some compensation, I suppose we could spare this. [He hands you a super stimpak.] Now I really should be getting back to work.}
{521}{}{Actually, I would like to ask you something else.}
{522}{}{Köszönöm. Viszlát!}
{523}{}{Really? You call this a reward? I'm gonna knock you around until something more valuable falls out.}
{530}{}{[Takes the seed.] Thank you, I will dispose of this immediately. [He sighs.] I knew Dr. Sheng had lost it, but I didn't think he'd go so far as to try and destroy his own people. He must be dealt with immediately.}
{531}{}{I agree. He's quite the madman.}
{540}{}{*clutches heart* Wahh.}
{541}{}{Örgh.}
{542}{}{Dr. Wong!}
{600}{}{You eliminate Dr. Sheng for the Shi.}
{601}{}{You deliver the plant sample to Dr. Wong.}
{602}{}{You assassinate Dr. Wong.}
