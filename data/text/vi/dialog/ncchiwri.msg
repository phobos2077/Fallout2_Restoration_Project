{100}{}{You see Chris Wright.}
{150}{}{You see a tall young man with a mohawk. He's wearing a lot of chains and leather.}
{151}{}{You see Chris Wright.}
{152}{}{You see Chris Wright. He looks bored out of his skull.}
{200}{}{Hey! }
{201}{}{Full on, }
{202}{}{Rock on, }
{203}{}{::Cheers::}
{204}{}{::Claps::}
{205}{}{::Whistles::}
{215}{}{How do you go to the bathroom with that thing on?}
{220}{}{Howdy, }
{221}{}{Damn hot, innit, }
{222}{}{Howdy, }
{230}{}{I still can't believe Dad is dead. There's so much that I wanted to say to him...}
{235}{}{Piss off.}
{236}{}{Piss off. I mean it.}
{237}{}{I ain't got nothing to say to you.}
{245}{}{Yeah?}
{246}{}{Hey! How's it going, }
{247}{}{Hey, you got my thanks for finding who killed Richard, }
{248}{}{. I owe you big, and the Wright family always pays its debts. What can I do for you?}
{249}{}{Mattah. Man is Mattah!}
{250}{}{Hoobajuube}
{251}{}{Wander off}
{252}{}{Who are you?}
{253}{}{Actually, yes. I'm looking for a job. Is Family Wright hiring?}
{254}{}{Say, I ran into your mom.}
{255}{}{Can you tell me about Richard?}
{256}{}{Nothing, thanks. Sorry to bother you.}
{265}{}{Piss off, retard. I ain't got time to do sign language with you.}
{266}{}{Wander off}
{275}{}{I'm Chris. Chris Wright. Of the Family Wright. Glad you asked?}
{276}{}{Actually, yes. I'm looking for a job. Is Family Wright hiring?}
{277}{}{Family Wright? Who's that?}
{278}{}{Chris Wright, huh? Say, I ran into your mom.}
{279}{}{Can you tell me what happened to your brother Richard?}
{280}{}{Not really. Sorry to bother you.}
{290}{}{You ain't heard of Family Wright? You musta been out in the desert too long. Family Wright
 is the biggest crime family in Reno. We're gonna rule this city.}
{291}{}{Really? Sounds like the Wright family holds all the cards. Are they hiring?}
{292}{}{Actually, I got the impression they were one of the weakest of the families... I mean, they
 only deal in alcohol, they have no casino or drug trade, and their numbers are much less than
 other families.}
{293}{}{Speaking of family, I ran into your mom.}
{294}{}{Can you tell me what happened to your brother Richard?}
{295}{}{Really? How interesting... well, look, I have to be going.}
{305}{}{Like what?}
{306}{}{Can you tell me about Family Wright?}
{307}{}{Is Family Wright hiring?}
{308}{}{I ran into your mom not long ago. Nice lady.}
{309}{}{Can you tell me what happened to your brother Richard?}
{310}{}{No, no other questions. I better be going.}
{315}{}{(The young man turns to you, looks you up and down. His eyes stop at the mark on your forehead.) Well, now.
 (He sneers, then spits on your feet.) Why don't you make yourself useful and lick that up, slaver?}
{316}{}{(The young man turns to you, looks you up and down.) Well, now. (He sneers, then spits on your feet.) Why don't you
 make yourself useful and lick that up, you piece of [FA] dogshit?}
{317}{}{Kick him with the boot he spat on.}
{318}{}{Wander off }
{319}{}{Let it alone and walk away. This time. }
{325}{}{Well... I...I mean, the Wright family... my family... might have an opening. I ain't promising nothing, but go to the mansion
 south of here, find my brother Keith and tell him I sent you. Name's Chris. Chris Wright.}
{326}{}{Uh, Family Wright? Who's that?}
{327}{}{Wright, huh? I ran into your mom.}
{328}{}{Can you tell me what happened to your brother Richard?}
{329}{}{Thanks. I'll go talk to him.}
{335}{}{Naw, I can't think of any place that's hiring.  Most of the families in town are pretty close-knit.}
{336}{}{All right then.}
{345}{}{Oh, great. Did she give you a speech?}
{346}{}{A little. Do you not like your mother?}
{347}{}{No. Does she usually?}
{348}{}{Not really. Look, I better be going. }
{355}{}{That a *joke?* If so, it damn well missed the funny mark by a mile. You trying to start something with Family
 Wright, wise guy?}
{356}{}{Start something? No, just *finish* it.}
{357}{}{No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Look, I had some other questions...}
{358}{}{No, not at all. I think I better be going. }
{365}{}{She just doesn't pay attention to what's going on around her. I love her n' all, but sometimes, she's as blind as a mule.}
{366}{}{Well, not long ago, she charged into our alcohol still here and busted up the place, destroying our entire cash crop! I love her n' all, but sometimes she's as blind as a mule.}
{367}{}{Heh-heh. And she looks like one, too.}
{368}{}{Blind? How do you mean?}
{369}{}{Oh. I had some other questions...}
{370}{}{I suppose. Look, I better be going. }
{380}{}{She goes around and preaches all about sinning and stuff, but she doesn't even really know what Dad does.
 Either that, or she ignores it.}
{381}{}{What does your Dad do?}
{382}{}{Hmmmm. Say, I had some other questions...}
{383}{}{Interesting. Well, I have to be going. }
{390}{}{Makes alcohol, runs guns, rubs out people who fuck with him... typical family stuff. Mom'd be pissed
 if she actually paid mind to what was going on. And 'specially if she found this still, here.}
{391}{}{How pissed would she be?}
{392}{}{Hmmmm. Say, I had some other questions...}
{393}{}{Interesting. Well, I have to be going. }
{400}{}{Probably pissed enough to wreck this place... at least. Then she'd give us all a tongue lashing and a few
 solid days of preaching. Heh.}
{401}{}{Interesting. Say, I had some other questions...}
{402}{}{Hmmmmm. Thanks. }
{410}{}{Rich? Aw, you know, he was found like one of those Jet crashers, dead in one of the gutters. Near as we can
 figure, someone pumped him with drugs until he was dead.}
{411}{}{'Someone' gave him too much? How do you know he didn't overdose because he took too much?}
{412}{}{Who do you figure might have done it?}
{413}{}{Sorry to hear that. I had some other questions...}
{414}{}{Nasty. Look, I have to be going. }
{420}{}{Cause he was a clean kid... Mom taught him THAT much. And if you feel like saying any different, maybe you and I
 should settle it right here.}
{421}{}{I didn't mean it like that. Sorry I brought it up.}
{422}{}{Don't blind yourself to the possibility he might have been taking it. Jet is extremely addictive.}
{423}{}{Look, KID, if you know what's good for you, you'll stop throwing down every time a little truth comes along
 and bites you in the ass.}
{424}{}{Who do you figure might have done it?}
{425}{}{I'm not looking for any trouble. I'll be going. }
{435}{}{Yeah, well, just watch it. Them's fighting words to any Wright, so don't go shooting off your mouth like that, awright?}
{436}{}{Don't blind yourself to the possibility he might have been taking it. Jet is extremely addictive.}
{437}{}{Look, KID, don't start with me. If you know what's good for you, you'll stop trying to throw down every time
 a little truth comes along and bites you in the ass.}
{438}{}{Sorry, no offense intended. Say, I had some other questions...}
{439}{}{Understood. I better be going. }
{445}{}{Piss off. I ain't got nothing more to say to you.}
{446}{}{Wait, I just had one more question...}
{447}{}{I'm leaving, I'm leaving. }
{455}{}{(Chris stares at you for a moment, then lunges at you!)}
{456}{}{So THIS is how it's gonna BE, huh? ALL RIGHT THEN, LET'S G --}
{465}{}{My guess is the Mordinos, either one of their dealers or one of the Mordino family themselves. Bastards make tons of Jet.}
{466}{}{Got it. Say, I had some other questions...}
{467}{}{Which of the dealers do you think sold it to Richard?}
{468}{}{I see. I better be going. }
{475}{}{Could have been any one of them: Jagged Jimmy J, that scarred son of a bitch at the corner of Virgin Street, or
 Renesco 'the Rocketman,' that weasel who sells Jet outta that fortified shell up on the West Side.}
{476}{}{Any other dealers?}
{477}{}{Got it. Say, I had some other questions...}
{485}{}{Hey, man, thank YOU.}
{486}{}{Hey, lady, thank YOU.}
{487}{}{You find out who killed my brother, and all of Family Wright'll be thanking you. And that's no small thanks, understand?}
{488}{}{I understand. Catch you later, Chris. }
{495}{}{Jules at the head of town also sells Jet, but he mostly sells to tourists... then there's Little Jesus Mordino:
 he mighta pushed drugs on Rich while Rich was out alone. He hangs out at the Desperado.}
{496}{}{Got it. Say, I had some other questions...}
{497}{}{Jagged Jimmy J, Renesco the Rocketman, Jules and Little Jesus... I'll check them out. Thanks for the info, Chris. }
{1200}{}{! Way to kick the Enclave's ass!}
{1201}{}{! You rock!}
{1202}{}{!}
{1220}{}{. What you been up to?}
{1221}{}{?}
{1222}{}{. How's things?}
{1246}{}{? Everybody treating you all right? Anything you need?}
