{6000}{}{The excavation is going according to schedule. Judging}
{6001}{}{by the old base blueprints, we should be reaching the}
{6002}{}{vat area shortly. Increased levels of the FEV virus}
{6003}{}{are present in both the air and soil samples we've}
{6004}{}{taken. Luckily our suits filter out the virus. Tell}
{6005}{}{the members of the Enclave they should have a pure}
{6006}{}{sample of the mutagen soon.}
{6007}{}{**END-PAR**}
#
{6008}{}{Also, I've begun to notice some changes in the miners.}
{6009}{}{They seem to be showing signs of increased strength,}
{6010}{}{stamina and a slight change in skin tone; obvious}
{6011}{}{signs of mutations by the FEV. The men are getting}
{6012}{}{nervous, as they too have noticed the change. Although}
{6013}{}{I've increased the number of guards, I fear if the}
{6014}{}{workers completely mutate, we'll be vastly outnumbered.}
{6015}{}{It is my hope, that since we are using the local}
{6016}{}{inhabitants as a work force, full mutation won't occur}
{6017}{}{unless they are directly exposed (dipped) in a pure}
{6018}{}{source or prolonged exposure to the virus occurs. As}
{6019}{}{you recall, minute amounts of the virus have been}
{6020}{}{detected throughout this region. Tests on subjects}
{6021}{}{living in this area have shown that they have built up}
{6022}{}{a tolerance to the FEV virus. However, I advise}
{6023}{}{caution since exposure to this level of the FEV virus}
{6024}{}{was never entered into the calculations. I advise that}
{6025}{}{you rig the entrance to the base to collapse as soon}
{6026}{}{as a pure sample is obtained. This will seal the}
{6027}{}{exposed miners into the base and prevent unfriendlies}
{6028}{}{from obtaining the virus once we are gone.}

{7002}{}{Personal Log}
{7003}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7004}{}{June 28, 2077}
{7005}{}{Today the boys in bio storage played a great joke on}
{7006}{}{me. One of the little pranksters altered the}
{7007}{}{settings on my Vault-Tec automated organ extractor. }
{7008}{}{Boy, was I surprised when Private Callow came out of }
{7009}{}{the operating room without a colon. Good thing he was}
{7010}{}{dead already or I'd be in trouble. I hardwired}
{7011}{}{the machine to extract only brains so this wouldn't}
{7012}{}{happen again. I'll get them back for this.}
{7013}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7014}{}{June 29, 2077}
{7015}{}{I removed Private Callow's liver and cooked it. I}
{7016}{}{then had it sent down to the boys in bio storage}
{7017}{}{with fava beans and a nice Chianti. They think it}
{7018}{}{was a special thank you from the general for a job}
{7019}{}{well done. I love my job.}
{7020}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7021}{}{June 30, 2077}
{7022}{}{I tried a new drug cocktail of Buffout and Psychos}
{7023}{}{on one of my patients, mixed with some special}
{7024}{}{enhancers I've been toying with. The results were}
{7025}{}{promising, if not messy. The subject became very}
{7026}{}{violent and managed to break out of his room.}
{7027}{}{Luckily, the new security robots were in place}
{7028}{}{and managed to subdue him. I'll have}
{7029}{}{maintenance come down and replace that door.}
{7030}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7031}{}{July 1, 2077}
{7032}{}{My favorite experiment died. I've been feeding}
{7033}{}{him a steady diet of Mentats mixed with my}
{7034}{}{special enhancers. He went from an IQ of 39 to}
{7035}{}{an IQ of 200 in just a few weeks. I am saddened}
{7036}{}{since he was one of the few people I could}
{7037}{}{really talk to. He will be sorely missed.}

{7040}{}{We think the new cybernetic brain is finally}

{7044}{}{July 6, 2077}
{7045}{}{Robotics isn't happy that their precious}
{7046}{}{computer is being modified to run the base's}
{7047}{}{security for the evacuation. I can't say I'm}
{7048}{}{happy either, since Skynet has been invaluable}
{7049}{}{in the development of the new cybernetic brain.}
{7050}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7051}{}{July 9, 2077}
{7052}{}{The evacuation has been moved up. What rotten}
{7053}{}{timing. We were just about to start on the}
{7054}{}{installation of the new cybernetic brain. They}
{7055}{}{say the evacuation is temporary, so I'll get}
{7056}{}{to continue my research when I come back. This}
{7057}{}{will probably be my last log for some time,}
{7058}{}{since I will be busy gathering up as much of my}
{7059}{}{research as possible.}

{8012}{}{The entire right hand was completely severed}
{8013}{}{and we were unable to locate the missing}
{8014}{}{appendage. Severe puncture wounds to the chest}

{8017}{}{Right eye was damaged beyond repair.  Surgery}

{11002}{}{Today's top story on GNN. In a financial coup,}
{11003}{}{the US managed to be the first to tap the world's}
{11004}{}{last remaining supply of oil. Until recently this}
{11005}{}{reserve of oil was thought to be unattainable}
{11006}{}{due to the deposit being located thousands}
{11007}{}{of feet beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean.}
{11008}{}{With the world's supply of oil nearing depletion,}
{11009}{}{a race to be the first to create a method to}
{11010}{}{extract this deposit ensued. We at the GNN}
{11011}{}{are proud to announce that the US is the first to do}
{11012}{}{so and thus claim the oil as property of the United}
{11013}{}{States. Way to go US!}
{11014}{}{**END-PAR**}
{11015}{}{China cries foul as news of the success circulates}
{11016}{}{around the globe. According to President Xin of }
{11017}{}{China, their drilling platform project was scheduled}
{11018}{}{for completion months before the US project, however}
{11019}{}{the Chinese platform had a string of unfortunate}
{11020}{}{accidents delaying their project significantly.}
{11021}{}{President Xin is also quoted in saying that he has}
{11022}{}{definitive proof that the US was behind the sabotage}
{11023}{}{of their oil platform and formally requests that an}
{11024}{}{international panel be appointed to investigate.}

{11039}{}{out of oil talks with the other world powers. After a}
{11040}{}{much heated debate, the President stormed out of the}
{11041}{}{meeting and declared that the last known supply of}
{11042}{}{petroleum will be used exclusively by the US and the}

{12003}{}{including the formerly-repressed teachings of the Hub. }
{12004}{}{This holodisk isn't meant to represent the final word on}
{12005}{}{Hubology - think of it as a primer, and us as your }
{12006}{}{spiritual guardians.}

{12014}{}{HISTORY}
{12015}{}{We were founded back before the Great Deluge by an}
{12016}{}{author and visionary of great promise, a man named Dick}
{12017}{}{Hubbell. He saw the failure of the medicine of that time,}
{12018}{}{and of the failure of religion, and of the failure of }
{12019}{}{government. He knew that the world needed something }
{12020}{}{new... the world needed Hubology. Inspired by music of the }
{12021}{}{time and his own personal experience with extraterrestrial}
{12022}{}{beings, he set out to show us wheels in the sky, to keep }
{12023}{}{them burning, and to understand the Great Wheel of Life.}
{12024}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12025}{}{We call him the Hub, for it is through him that we}
{12026}{}{understand our place in the Wheel - he is our center, and}
{12027}{}{we are his spokes. It is around his teachings that we}
{12028}{}{revolve.}
{12029}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12030}{}{With the publication of countless books and journals,}
{12031}{}{the Hub began spreading the word of Hubology - and}
{12032}{}{immediately became a target for his detractors. They }
{12033}{}{called his work "pseudo-science" and "dangerous dribble}
{12034}{}{that can only hurt its adherents." Despite the collected}
{12035}{}{sightings of Extra-Terrestrial Vehicles across the globe,}
{12036}{}{they insisted on quashing the Hub's word. We know that }
{12037}{}{they were simply stupid and misguided, but they were }
{12038}{}{powerful; they included governments and corporations and}
{12039}{}{other such entities, keeping the greatest news of all time}
{12040}{}{from the people of the earth.}
{12041}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12042}{}{Hubology was driven underground for a time, marshalling}
{12043}{}{its forces against the attacks of those who envied its}
{12044}{}{simplicity and ease of use for the common man. When at}
{12045}{}{last the Hubologists of that time struck back, they did}
{12046}{}{it in such a way that few could stand against them - they}
{12047}{}{infiltrated the organizations that sought to destroy them}
{12048}{}{and created "television" shows that sought to expose the}
{12049}{}{lies the government had fed the people.}
{12050}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12051}{}{This caused a subtle backlash against our religion. The}
{12052}{}{common man found reason to doubt Hubology because of }
{12053}{}{the distorted teachings of the media, and we had to wage}
{12054}{}{a long campaign against those who would call us crackpots.}
{12055}{}{During this time, sadly, the great Hub passed away.}
{12056}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12057}{}{Bolstered by the knowledge that The Hub had achieved}
{12058}{}{unity with the Star Father, helping to turn the cosmic}
{12059}{}{wheel in our direction, attaining another level of }
{12060}{}{consciousness, we remained confident in ourselves that}
{12061}{}{ours was the true way. Along the way, we gained }
{12062}{}{adherents, many of whom who simply wanted to believe }
{12063}{}{that there was a place out there that is better than }
{12064}{}{this world. We offer proof of life on other planets, }
{12065}{}{and a philosophy that allows us to understand the way }
{12066}{}{of the universe. People have come to us over the ages, }
{12067}{}{impressed by the rightness of our minds. And the fact }
{12068}{}{that we have survived the Great Deluge unscathed }
{12069}{}{teaches us that the Great Wheel turns toward our}
{12070}{}{teachings!}
{12071}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12072}{}{PHILOSOPHY}
{12073}{}{Hubology contains a simple philosophy, culled from the}
{12074}{}{finest religious and philosophical minds of pre-Deluge}
{12075}{}{Earth - we believe that life, the universe, and}
{12076}{}{everything can best be symbolized by a turning wheel.}
{12077}{}{The outer rim of wheel contains those who do not}
{12078}{}{understand our teachings and who do not understand the}
{12079}{}{truth. We call them "rim meat", for the Wheel turns over}
{12080}{}{them and grinds them, and they do not appreciate its}
{12081}{}{workings.}
{12082}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12083}{}{Those who practice Hubology are the Spokes of the Wheel.}
{12084}{}{We understand the motion of the Wheel and do our best to}
{12085}{}{facilitate its turning. Those who control a portion of }
{12086}{}{the wheel are called Hubs - and as far as we know, there}
{12087}{}{have been only a few Hubs, enlightened individuals who }
{12088}{}{seek to better the lots of their fellow earthlings. We }
{12089}{}{refer to the founder of Hubology as THE Hub, for he is }
{12090}{}{the one with the most correct teaching.}
{12091}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12092}{}{In the practice of our religion, we simply apply scientific}
{12093}{}{techniques developed by the Hub and perfected by his }
{12094}{}{inheritors to align the flawed neurodynes that create }
{12095}{}{disharmony and an asymmetrical wheel. This allows us to}
{12096}{}{purify ourselves and prepare us for self-examination. It}
{12097}{}{is only through self-examination that we are able to}
{12098}{}{succeed, and only through self-examination that we}
{12099}{}{understand our place in the cosmos and on the Great }
{12100}{}{Wheel. It is only through self-examination that we }
{12101}{}{discover ourselves to be worthy of boarding the fiery }
{12102}{}{rings when they meet us on the planet Quetzel.}
{12103}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12104}{}{We think of ourselves as a religion combined with the best}
{12105}{}{scientific technique - scientific spirituality is what we}
{12106}{}{call it... and what we hope you'll be calling it before too}
{12107}{}{long!}
{12108}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12109}{}{This is our creation story:}
{12110}{}{Aeons ago, all lived peacefully and in harmony with one }
{12111}{}{another. Body, mind, and spirit were joined in all }
{12112}{}{creatures, and the technology that existed boggled the}
{12113}{}{imaginations. It was a time of peace, creativity, and}
{12114}{}{alignment - and then the Dark Days came. Thrakazog the }
{12115}{}{Pot Hole began to teach mind-body dualism and the }
{12116}{}{sundering of the spirit, and war arose. The Great War }
{12117}{}{destroyed souls and bodies and scattered their remnants }
{12118}{}{across the universe. The Great Wheel came close to }
{12119}{}{separating from the axle of existence, its spokes broken }
{12120}{}{in the rut Thrakazog had created. A new life had to arise.}
{12121}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12122}{}{And arise it did, on the planet Terra, as on other planets}
{12123}{}{across the universe. (We focus mainly on the life that}
{12124}{}{arose on Terra, for while we believe that we will once }
{12125}{}{again heal the sundered spokes of the Wheel with our }
{12126}{}{starry brothers, we must first concentrate on making }
{12127}{}{ourselves useful spokes.) This new life was polluted by}
{12128}{}{the soul-pieces of the dead. This led to hate and }
{12129}{}{misunderstanding, and wars raged across Terra's surface}
{12130}{}{until one day a visionary realized that the only way to}
{12131}{}{create peace, understanding, and enlightenment was to }
{12132}{}{cleanse these soul-pieces from the spirits of humanity.}
{12133}{}{That visionary was The Hub. His cleansing continues today.}
{12134}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12135}{}{SMALL GLOSSARY}
{12136}{}{AHS/Aligned Hub Seeker: The levels of enlightenment are }
{12137}{}{measured by the cleansing of your neurodynes, cleaning }
{12138}{}{out the base negative energy of your meat and }
{12139}{}{converting it to positive mental energy. When you have }
{12140}{}{achieved a strong enough level of zetan energy, you can }
{12141}{}{travel to Quetzel, or you can wait and hope that the }
{12142}{}{Uplifting will come during your lifetime.}
{12143}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12144}{}{Alignment : When a neurodyne is polluted and keeps a }
{12145}{}{seeker's Zeta levels down, we "align" the levels to the }
{12146}{}{universal Wheel by running a Zeta Scan on the affected }
{12147}{}{neurodyne, cleansing it of taint. Too much alignment too }
{12148}{}{quickly is harmful for the spirit, however.}
{12149}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12150}{}{Enlightenment: Enlightenment is the state achieved past }
{12151}{}{AHS-9 - when the seeker has gained so much knowledge he }
{12152}{}{becomes an integral part of the Great Wheel and leaves }
{12153}{}{this earthly existence behind. Some of the Enlightened }
{12154}{}{remain on Terra to guide the rest of us to a state of }
{12155}{}{grace, to show us how to get behind the Wheel of our own }
{12156}{}{lives.}
{12157}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12158}{}{Great Wheel: This refers to the cyclical nature of the }
{12159}{}{universe, space, and time. Everything is a part of the }
{12160}{}{Great Wheel. There are some who can take control of the }
{12161}{}{Wheel - or perhaps they simply understand the direction }
{12162}{}{in which it travels - and we call them gods, prophets, }
{12163}{}{and visionaries. Those who master the Great Wheel are }
{12164}{}{truly enlightened.}
{12165}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12166}{}{Neurodyne: Neurodynes are the stations of the spirit. }
{12167}{}{Ancient religions called them "shakras". They can be }
{12168}{}{polluted by soul-pieces and negative energy emanating }
{12169}{}{from oppressives.}
{12170}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12171}{}{Oppressives: Oppressives are those individuals who are }
{12172}{}{so full of negative energy and polluted soul-pieces that }
{12173}{}{they drag down those who seek enlightenment by their }
{12174}{}{very presence. They are to be avoided - many of them are }
{12175}{}{so polluted they do not recognize the value to be found }
{12176}{}{in a good cleansing, and they do their best to divert }
{12177}{}{the course of the Great Wheel.}
{12178}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12179}{}{Quetzel: The planet to which the Star Father will bring }
{12180}{}{us when we have become Optimized, where we will meet }
{12181}{}{with our starry brethren and join them on their flaming }
{12182}{}{wheels in the sky.}

{12184}{}{Rim Meat: A basic person, one who has not yet been }
{12185}{}{aligned to purify his neurodynes.}
{12186}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12187}{}{Star Father: Some would call the Star Father "god". We }
{12188}{}{prefer to think of the Star Father as the universal }
{12189}{}{force from which we draw our energy, and to which we }
{12190}{}{feed our energy in turn - again, a cyclical relationship.}
{12191}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12192}{}{Uplifting: The time when the Star Father calls us home }
{12193}{}{to Quetzel, where we meet our extra-terrestrial brethren }
{12194}{}{and move closer to the hub of the Great Wheel. Those who }
{12195}{}{have made an effort to understand and embrace the }
{12196}{}{words of the Hub, no matter their AHS levels, will be }
{12197}{}{invited to join the Star Father in the heavens on planet }
{12198}{}{Quetzel.}
{12199}{}{**END-PAR**}
{12200}{}{Zeta Scan: Another word for "alignment", the Zeta Scan }
{12201}{}{helps to purify your neurodynes and clear your spirit. }
{12202}{}{It consists of a machine that runs massive doses of }
{12203}{}{electricity through your skin - this electricity has }
{12204}{}{been carefully formulated, to the exact volt, to the }
{12205}{}{amount of energy needed to drive the negative energy }
{12206}{}{from a neurodyne. By accepting a Zeta Scan, your course }

{16007}{}{But what is it, you want to know?}
{16008}{}{**END-PAR**}
{16009}{}{HOW BIG IS NCR?}
{16010}{}{Founded eighty years ago, the NCR is now comprised of }
{16011}{}{the states of Shady, Los Angeles, Maxson, Hub, and    }
{16012}{}{Dayglow.  Approximately 700,000 citizens are pleased  }
{16013}{}{to call NCR home.}
{16014}{}{**END-PAR**}
{16015}{}{WHAT DOES NCR STAND FOR?}
{16016}{}{The New California Republic is dedicated to bringing  }
{16017}{}{peace, security and justice to the people of the great}
{16018}{}{west.  NCR's fine police forces constantly patrol and }
{16019}{}{arrest any raiders, cannibals, slavers, and lawless  }
{16020}{}{mutants within the country, and the NCR army valiantly}
{16021}{}{protects the borders against outside marauders. To    }
{16022}{}{ensure justice and liberty, all citizens have access  }
{16023}{}{to NCR's courts and the right to vote for a           }
{16024}{}{representative of their choice to sit in the Hall of  }

{16028}{}{WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?}

{16031}{}{dictators here. Our leaders are elected by the people!}
{16032}{}{That's right -- every state has the right to send     }
{16033}{}{representatives to the Hall of Congress. These        }
{16034}{}{representatives select the President and              }
{16035}{}{Vice-President to head the council and it is their    }
{16036}{}{advice which guides the President's decisions. For   }
{16037}{}{ten terms now, President Tandi has been the unanimous }
{16038}{}{choice of the council, who respect her wisdom and     }

{16040}{}{**END-PAR**}
{16041}{}{SOUNDS GREAT! HOW DO I JOIN THE NCR?}
{16042}{}{All law-abiding and peaceful people, human or mutant, }
{16043}{}{are eligible to become citizens of NCR. To become a   }
{16044}{}{citizen all you have to do is move to NCR and present }
{16045}{}{your claim for immigration. After citizenship training}
{16046}{}{and processing your application, you will be notified}

{16054}{}{BUT WHAT IF MY ENTIRE TOWN WANTS TO JOIN?}
{16055}{}{Depending on where your town is located, NCR does     }

{16057}{}{city-states, even minor kingdoms for annexation by    }
{16058}{}{NCR. Once the petition is accepted, NCR will grant    }

# The Project
{20000}{}{Memo: The Projects, Quarterly Status Brief}
{20001}{}{From: Lt. Col., Dr Charles Curling, U.S. Chemical Corps.}
{20002}{}{To: Cabinet}
{20003}{}{Subject: Project near reaching full operational status.}
{20004}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20005}{}{It is my honor, and happy privilege, to report the near}
{20006}{}{completion of The Project. After years of work, we've }
{20007}{}{managed to isolate the most toxic elements of the FEV}
{20008}{}{virus. Some of the only recently decoded information}
{20009}{}{that we retrieved from the abandoned military base on the}
{20010}{}{mainland has been instrumental in advancing our research.}
{20011}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20012}{}{We've discovered that the FEV virus was not originally}
{20013}{}{designed to be used as an agent for the creation of}
{20014}{}{super-soldiers. Initially, it appears, the FEV was }
{20015}{}{designed as a virulent toxin. Only later was the FEV}
{20016}{}{virus manipulated in an attempt to create super-soldiers.}
{20017}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20018}{}{By backtracking somewhat in our research, and with the}
{20019}{}{help of the additional information from the military }
{20020}{}{base's records, we've been able to turn our version of }
{20021}{}{the FEV (FEV Curling-13) into a far more toxic }
{20022}{}{agent.}
{20023}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20024}{}{Final tests conducted on the vault-descendant subjects,}
{20025}{}{from the village "Arroyo," have shown a survival rate}
{20026}{}{of zero-percent, with most deaths occurring within }
{20027}{}{one-hour of exposure to a .0001% aerosol solution. By }
{20028}{}{contrast, the subjects extracted from Vault 13 tend }
{20029}{}{to suffer subdural hemorrhaging and convulsions within }
{20030}{}{one-hour of exposure, with death not occurring, on }
{20031}{}{average, for another 14.5 hours.}
{20032}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20033}{}{In either case, the FEV's toxicity levels are now }
{20034}{}{sufficient to insure a "clean-sweep" of all infested }
{20035}{}{(i.e. non-Enclave) locales. Current releasable levels }
{20036}{}{of FEV Curling-13 show a 95% probability of .00007%}
{20037}{}{average saturation. While the consensus of the Chemical}
{20038}{}{Corps is that this would be a sufficient level to insure}
{20039}{}{the success of the Project, we believe that it is worth}
{20040}{}{waiting until we can accumulate enough FEV toxin to}
{20041}{}{reach our .0001% saturation and 99.5% extermination }
{20042}{}{level goal.}
{20043}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20044}{}{Current FEV Curling-13 production levels show that}
{20045}{}{we'll reach our release goal, of 250,000 gallons, within}
{20046}{}{six weeks.}
{20047}{}{**END-PAR**}
{20048}{}{Congratulations, ladies and gentlemen, our long years of}

{21005}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21006}{}{NOTE to the CABINET: I hate to be a nag by bringing }
{21007}{}{this up all the time, but I cannot overemphasize the }
{21008}{}{importance of diversifying our Atomic Powerplant's }
{21009}{}{control systems. Here's my official report. I think that}
{21010}{}{once you read it, you'll understand why we need to have }
{21011}{}{a backup system.}
{21012}{}{--Tom}
{21013}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21014}{}{Atomic Energy Reactor Regulator}
{21015}{}{------------------------------------------}
{21016}{}{Vault-Tec's new Uranium Nuclear Reactor has been working}
{21017}{}{to top efficiency so far. With the state of the art }
{21018}{}{computer systems that were made specifically for the }
{21019}{}{task of regulating the coolant temperature as well as }
{21020}{}{many other key functions, we are able to allow the }
{21021}{}{reactor to run with minimal supervision.}
{21022}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21023}{}{The new Synchronic multi-processors that we had built}
{21024}{}{into the tri-processor motherboard are able to multitask}
{21025}{}{the coolant temperature, the intake of cool sea water,}
{21026}{}{the outtake of expended coolant and waste from the }
{21027}{}{reactions, and the regulation of the neutron bombardment}
{21028}{}{upon the uranium. Without the computer systems, the }
{21029}{}{reactor would go out of balance almost immediately, }
{21030}{}{causing a chain-reaction bombardment of the uranium }
{21031}{}{isotopes. Within two hours, or less, this would result}
{21032}{}{in a nuclear explosion equivalent in the 100-kiloton}
{21033}{}{range.}
{21034}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21035}{}{The sum of the main portions of the reactor are placed}
{21036}{}{underwater, beneath the station. This arrangement }
{21037}{}{allows the ocean's natural temperature to keep the }
{21038}{}{exterior cooler. Seawater, from 500 meters, is pumped }
{21039}{}{into the coolant chamber. A portion of the cool seawater}
{21040}{}{is diverted to the containment unit, where the core and}
{21041}{}{control rods are. There, it circulates through the core,}
{21042}{}{becoming heated from the nuclear reaction taking place. }
{21043}{}{The seawater reaches the boiling point and the resulting}
{21044}{}{steam is used to turn the turbine generator to create }
{21045}{}{all of our electricity. The steam then condenses and }
{21046}{}{returns to a filter tank. The cleansed water is entered}
{21047}{}{back into a preparation tank, ready to start the cycle }
{21048}{}{all over again.}
{21049}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21050}{}{Severely radiated water, and miscellaneous toxic }
{21051}{}{materials, are pumped out of the station through a }
{21052}{}{waste-conduit, terminating one mile to the south. }
{21053}{}{Reports from our survey crews state that our effluvia}
{21054}{}{drifts down the coast of southern California and Mexico,}
{21055}{}{causing irreversible ecological damage. Many of the }
{21056}{}{beaches are now saturated with toxic waste, and highly}
{21057}{}{radiated sea life. Fortunately, this doesn't effect us.}
{21058}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21059}{}{In any case, if our reactor is shut down, we do have }
{21060}{}{some backup batteries that can be used to power vital }
{21061}{}{systems throughout the Enclave until power is restored.}
{21062}{}{However, these do not include extraneous and high energy }
{21063}{}{items such as forcefields. Also, as a safety precaution}
{21064}{}{certain watertight doors throughout the station, will }
{21065}{}{close when power is reduced (to prevent flooding in case }
{21066}{}{of an emergency). This will restrict movement through the}
{21067}{}{station but movement to the top of the station is still}
{21068}{}{possible, through alternate routes.}
{21069}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21070}{}{The real problem is that if the computer is}
{21071}{}{shut down or destroyed, unlikely though both of those }
{21072}{}{events may be, the reactor will go critical to the point}
{21073}{}{of meltdown within two-hours. We need to install some}
{21074}{}{sort of a human-maintained backup system. I know that}
{21075}{}{you may think I'm an alarmist for bringing up these }
{21076}{}{provisions for an unthinkable event, however it always}
{21077}{}{pays to be prepared.}
{21078}{}{**END-PAR**}
{21079}{}{In the meantime, let's just make sure no one blows up our}
{21080}{}{computer (hah, hah).}
