{44955}{}{I love the sound of tearing flesh, don't you?}
{44956}{}{Just warming up, the best is yet to come.}
{44957}{}{Just sharpening my claws.}
{44958}{}{Ooops! Hope you didn't need that!}
{44959}{}{If you fall over and stay there I'll go away!}

# target being missed

{44960}{}{Will you stop moving around so I can hit you?}
{44961}{}{Glasses. Must look into getting some glasses.}
{44962}{}{Don't laugh. When I do hit you, it's going to hurt!}
{44963}{}{Arrg! Grng! Ghrr! Thpt! (Deathclaw four-letter words)}
{44964}{}{I guess I shouldn't make a career out of fighting.}
{44965}{}{How could I possibly miss anything as big as you are!}
{44966}{}{As soon as I get ranged in you're in trouble.}
{44967}{}{You're a nimble little shit aren't you.}
{44968}{}{I'm glad my mother didn't see me do that.}
{44969}{}{Why am I swinging over there when you're over here?}
{44970}{}{How embarrassing. Please don't tell anyone I did that.}
{44971}{}{That really pisses me off!}
{44972}{}{Ok. I missed! It could happen to anyone!}
{44973}{}{I'll get you next time.}
{44974}{}{Way to go, Grace!}
{44975}{}{That was a shining example of missing the target!}
{44976}{}{I'm beginning to think I'm not cut out for this.}
{44977}{}{Arrggh! I can't believe I missed you!}
{44978}{}{I fanned the air on that one I did!}
{44979}{}{Did I just miss you or what!}
