Come in, Chosen One. There are things you must know.
The village is dying. The signs are everywhere - withering crops, dying brahmin, sick children. We know the time grows short. Without help soon it will be the end of us all.
There is hope. A slim hope that few know of. The old disks speak of an item called the GECK, the Garden of Eden Creation Kit. It is said it can bring life to the wasteland.
This will be your quest if you prove yourself worthy. For that proof, you must first journey to the Temple of Trials. If you survive, come back to me we will talk more.
Our life is in your hands, Chosen One. Prove yourself. Find the GECK. Be our salvation.
