{100}{}{You see a squat man wearing squalid clothing.}
{101}{}{You see Brian.}
{102}{}{You see a squat man wearing squalid clothing. He has a toothpick in his mouth and is covered in grease. His fingernails are dirty.}
{103}{}{Let's see how you like this, you antisocial jerk.}
{104}{}{Whaddya want?}
{105}{}{Nyug aarg.}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{What is this place?}
{108}{}{Ever hear of a GECK?}
{109}{}{Say, Eric asked me to adjust the power ration to his house. He said that he's sweating too much.}
{110}{}{Hey, Eric's really happy in his nice cool house. And I notice the power hasn't failed across the city.}
{111}{}{I just went and talked to Eric and he said that he used to run the place and that there's so much power in the uranium slugs that you'd never notice the small drain he'd take. So cough up the power.}
{112}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{113}{}{Me? I'm Brian. I work the generator that powers this place.}
{114}{}{Then you're the guy I need to see. Eric says he's too uncomfortable in his place, and he needs more power for his air conditioning.}
{115}{}{I see. That's very interesting. Must be rewarding work.}
{116}{}{Great. I have more questions.}
{117}{}{This place is the power station for Broken Hills. What I do is essentially a maintenance job on the place... make sure it keeps running. It's pretty damn functional, though... powered by uranium slugs.}
{118}{}{That must be great. Say, I have more questions.}
{119}{}{Uranium slugs?}
{120}{}{Interesting. Bye,}
{121}{}{A GECK? Never heard of it. I'd imagine no-one else here has either. It sounds like an animal or something that has nasty claws, though.}
{122}{}{No, that's not what I'm looking for. I have more questions though.}
{123}{}{That's not it at all. Bye.}
{124}{}{Eric wants more power? Eric can't HAVE more power. This is a very delicate balance of energy we run through here, and if Eric gets more power, then the hospital shuts down. Or the lights. Or the mine. We can't have that.}
{125}{}{If this machine is run on uranium slugs, you have more than enough power to fill this place AND New Reno and not even notice the drain. Now cough it up.}
{126}{}{But... but... he's suffering.}
{127}{}{So there's no way you can make a couple of small adjustments?}
{128}{}{[He looks sullenly down at his dials and says in a small voice.] You're mean.}
{129}{}{Yup. Bye!}
{130}{}{Hey! Don't touch anything! This is delicate equipment! Out! Outside! Go on! Go home!}
{131}{}{Ooooh! Butunz!}
{132}{}{Well, no, it's not. Not really. I mostly just sit here and make sure none of the dials flip out. I make some minor adjustments. I flip some switches. That's about all. Anyone could do it.}
{133}{}{So, say, you could send more power to Eric's home?}
{134}{}{Anyone, eh? I have other questions.}
{135}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{136}{}{Well, with the uranium mine right there, and with atomic power being the power of the future, it seems only right that we keep up with the times. We might be small, but we're progressive.}
{137}{}{Hmm. Right. I have other questions.}
{138}{}{Right. Bye.}
{139}{}{Well, sure, technically that's true, but...}
{140}{}{But nothing. You're just lazy. Get a move on.}
{141}{}{You don't have to be mean about it. [He ducks his head and turns a dial.] There. Please tell him to stop complaining now.}
{142}{}{You're all heart, big guy.}
{143}{}{Go shove it up the lips you never kiss with. No thanks to you for making this harder than it had to be.}
{144}{}{Maybe he just ought to bathe more often. Good day.}
{145}{}{Bye.}
{146}{}{No. I'm afraid not. The needs of the city outweigh the needs of the one.}
{147}{}{I have other questions, then.}
{148}{}{That's very utilitarian of you. I'll let him know he's not important. Goodbye.}
{149}{}{Hmm... wha'... huh?}
{150}{}{Zzzzzz... snore...}
{151}{}{Whadda want...? Hmm...? ::snore::}
