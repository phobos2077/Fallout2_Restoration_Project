{100}{}{You see an enthusiastic Shi.}
{101}{}{You see Mai Da Chiang, the owner of Red 888 Guns.}
{102}{}{This is a rotund Shi who looks like he's running on permanent overdrive.}
{103}{}{Hi! Welcome to Red 888 Guns! I'm Mai Da Chiang, the owner. How can I help you?}
{104}{}{Grokken di ma!}
{105}{}{Me buy!}
{106}{}{I was looking for some weaponry.}
{107}{}{Tell me about the place.}
{108}{}{Forget it.}
{109}{}{I'm sorry! I don't speak your language! Have a nice day!}
{110}{}{Rrr?}
{111}{}{Ahh, a weapon, eh? Well, this is what I have.}
{112}{}{-more-}
{113}{}{Great, great. Thank you for your business. Come back soon!}
{114}{}{More questions!}
{115}{}{Bye!}
{116}{}{No. Is not good enough. So sorry. Something else perhaps?}
{117}{}{More questions.}
{118}{}{No. Bye}
{119}{}{You need something else?}
{120}{}{Me buy!}
{121}{}{No. Bye.}
{122}{}{I was looking for some weaponry.}
{123}{}{Tell me about the place.}
{124}{}{Forget it.}
{125}{}{We have lived here for years, but we did not always live here. Dr. Fung knows the complete history. I'll bet what you're looking for is what we do now.}
{126}{}{Yep.}
{127}{}{No, actually, I wanted to know the history. I'll go find Fung. See you.}
{128}{}{Now, we are mainly fishermen and scientists. Our fishermen catch fish. Our scientists are working on a project that they say will change the world.}
{129}{}{Change the world how?}
{130}{}{What else is happening in town?}
{131}{}{Hmm. Interesting. I have more questions.}
{132}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{133}{}{I do not know. They keep their secrets to themselves.}
{134}{}{I see. What else is happening in town?}
{135}{}{I see. I have more questions.}
{136}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{137}{}{We have two rivals of martial arts in town. They are Lo Pan, a lover of self, and the Dragon, who loves others. It is said that whoever wins will determine the future of martial arts.}
{138}{}{I see. Anything else in town?}
{139}{}{I see. I have more questions.}
{140}{}{Thanks.}
{141}{}{There is a gang of vagrants who have moved onto the Poseidon Oil tanker on the wharf. There were monsters living inside it, but the vagrants have sealed them into the lower hull. Though they are outsiders, we are grateful to the drifters for this task.}
{142}{}{Any other news?}
{143}{}{I see. I have more questions.}
{144}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{145}{}{The scientists report that someone has broken through their computer security and stolen our secrets.}
{146}{}{Any other news?}
{147}{}{I see. I have more questions.}
{148}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{149}{}{That is all I can think of at the moment. Good day.}
{150}{}{Good day.}
{151}{}{You are a thief, a murderer, and a villain. I'm afraid I must kill you.}
