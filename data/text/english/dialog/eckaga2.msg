{104}{}{After Kaga kill you, he will burn Arroyo to the ground.}
{105}{}{Feel the wrath of Kaga!}
{106}{}{I am the great Kaga!}

{150}{}{[A tall and powerfully built warrior stands before you, his eyes blaze with hatred as he looks you over.] So, they cast out Kaga, then deem YOU the Chosen One? Ha! You think being the grandchild of the Vault Dweller makes you special?! You think you are better than I, Kaga the Great?!}
{151}{}{Well, I AM the Chosen One, aren't I?}
{152}{}{Hey now, hold on a second. I never said I was better than you.}
