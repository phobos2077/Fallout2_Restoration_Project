{203}{}{Yes, the chemicals are all here. You can check them if you like.}
{204}{}{*Zztttt* That will not be necessary. *Zzzttt*}
{205}{}{*Zztttt* You know what will happen if the chemicals do not meet the specifications
 we requested. *Zzzttt*}

# 6. VERTIBIRD SEQUENCE: (WTG)
{400}{}{[Looks like there is a door. Open it and climb in?]}
{401}{}{Yup}
{402}{}{Wander off}
{403}{}{Board the Vertibird.}
{404}{}{Leave it alone.}

# 7. VERTIBIRD: TAKE OFF (7)
{450}{}{[Once you climb inside the cargo hold, the door seals behind you! You attempt to force it open, but it won't
 budge. As you try to think of a way out, you hear the armored soldiers board the Vertibird, which then takes off with
 you trapped inside!]}
{451}{}{Uh-oh}
{452}{}{Oh, shit...}

# 8. DISPLAY TEXT: BOXES (WTG)

 them, you suspect that they contain some sort of hazardous chemicals.}

# GENERAL TALK
