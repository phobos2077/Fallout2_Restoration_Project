# Floats if PC is male
{200}{}{You're an illegal alien on Enclave territory. Proposition 312 orders us to shoot on sight.
 Sorry, boy!}
{201}{}{He's a mutant spy! Take him out, team!}
{202}{}{As a loyal soldier of the Enclave, I got orders to kill you. Hope you don't mind.}
{203}{}{Base we got an intruder, sector 3; awaiting orders... Kill him? Roger that base.}
{204}{}{Now I suppose you're going to tell me you're just out looking for a water chip. Do I look dumb?
 Get him!}
{205}{}{Die, wasteland scum!}
{206}{}{You! It's your kind that destroyed this once mighty nation. You're gonna pay!}
{207}{}{Hey, Louie! You ever seen what one of these babies does to soft tissue? Watch!}

{300}{}{Geez, I hate having to kill a woman. Let's make this quick, okay?}
{301}{}{Alarm! Alarm!}
{302}{}{Looks like you come a long way for nothing, lady. }
{303}{}{As a loyal soldier of the Enclave, I got orders to kill you. Hope you don't mind.}
{304}{}{You! It's your kind that destroyed this once mighty nation. You're gonna pay!}
{305}{}{Don't worry, it's only some wasteland bimbo. She won't put up much of a fight.}
{306}{}{It's a shame we couldn't have met under different circumstances.}
{307}{}{Don't talk to me! You'll not corrupt me with your feminine temptations! Die!}
