{100}{}{The person you see is glowing faintly. Its skin seems to be badly burnt.}
{101}{}{You see a Glowing One, a citizen of Gecko.}
{102}{}{You see someone who has been exposed to so much radiation that they are glowing faintly.
 That much radiation looks as though it should have killed them, but it they seem well enough.}

{110}{}{This much radiation sure spells job security for me.}
{111}{}{Look at it glow. Can you see it?}
{112}{}{I love coming to work everyday.}
{113}{}{Going to need more uranium again.}
{114}{}{I guess we're all atomic powered here.}

{120}{}{I just love the warmth here.}
{121}{}{It feels wonderful here.}
{122}{}{I don't know what I'd do If I had to live elsewhere.}
{123}{}{I love the feel of radiation in the morning.}
{124}{}{At least I never need a nightlight.}
{125}{}{(holds his glowing finger out to you) Phone home.}
{126}{}{You know, if you shut the door, I don't glow anymore.}
{127}{}{This is one place I really feel like I belong.}
{128}{}{I can't believe those Vault City people want to destroy my home.}
{129}{}{Reactor, sweet reactor.}
{130}{}{Be it ever so humble.}
{131}{}{Atomic powered heating... gotta love it.}

{140}{}{Thanks for fixing the reactor. It's a little cooler now, but not too bad.}
{141}{}{Brrr... thanks for fixing our reactor.}
{142}{}{I wish I could have gotten that part.}
{143}{}{Thanks for your help.}
{144}{}{Maybe those Vault City people aren't so bad after all.}

{150}{}{I can't remember when the reactor ran this well.}
{151}{}{It's downright chilly in here today.}
{152}{}{Brrrr, I'm freezing.}
{153}{}{I think I've got frostbite or something.}
{154}{}{Does it feel cold to you?}
