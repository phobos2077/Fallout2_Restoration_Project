{100}{}{You see a waterpump.}
{101}{}{You see a really old waterpump that appears to be broken.}
{102}{}{The waterpump is working fine now.}
{103}{}{You are going to need more than just your hands to fix this machine. Perhaps some tools would help with installing
 this part.}
{104}{}{You repaired the waterpump.}
{105}{}{You failed to repair the pump.}
{106}{}{You find out what is wrong with the water pump.}

{200}{}{You open the machine and look inside. You see a lot of rusty gears and motors. One of the motors
 has a crack in it.}
{201}{}{Call it a day.}
{202}{}{Investigate more.}
{203}{}{Upon closer inspection you see that the crack is not the cause of the trouble, but rather
 the connection for where the wires go. The connectors seem to have burned out over the years of use. It's going to
 take a whole new motor as well as a new set of wires to get this machine working again.}
{204}{}{Exit.}
