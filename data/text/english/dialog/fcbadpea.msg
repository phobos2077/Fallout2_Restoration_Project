{100}{}{You see a person in funny pajamas.}
{101}{}{You see a Shi townsperson.}
{102}{}{This person looks different from anyone you've seen before. They don't seem to care much about you.}
{103}{}{You're not a spy, are you?}
{104}{}{Who are you?}
{105}{}{Fish and seaweed. That's all we get.}
{106}{}{Ha ha! Look at the funny round-eyes!}
{107}{}{You look like a Hubologist.}
{108}{}{Leave us in peace.}
{109}{}{Long live Lo Pan!}
{110}{}{Down with the Dragon!}
{111}{}{Lo Pan is a hero.}
{112}{}{Look out for the Dragon. He's trouble.}
{113}{}{Those punks are always so loud.}
{114}{}{Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::}
{115}{}{Isn't there more to life than this?}
{116}{}{We're smarter than you think.}
{117}{}{Look! A lao wai!}
{118}{}{Welcome to San Francisco.}
{119}{}{You seem like a person with a straight head.}
{120}{}{Lo Pan can use your help.}
{121}{}{Don't hurt the people in red, lao wai.}
{122}{}{Lao wai means "foreigner".}
{123}{}{You're on our side, right?}
{124}{}{Kill the Dragon for us, will you?}
{125}{}{You honor us with your presence.}
{126}{}{Our leader! Stricken!}
{127}{}{We must get vengeance for Lo Pan!}
{128}{}{Who will lead us to greatness if Lo Pan is dead?}
{129}{}{What shall we do now?}
{130}{}{We are dishonored. We should be dead like Lo Pan.}
{131}{}{Life holds no meaning.}
{132}{}{If Lo Pan is dead our dreams are crushed.}
{133}{}{Lo Pan was the last great leader.}
{134}{}{The Dragon is dead! Lo Pan is victorious!}
{135}{}{Mock the losers!}
{136}{}{The Dragon has fallen!}
{137}{}{Lo Pan! Lo Pan! Lo Pan!}
{138}{}{We are the winners!}
{139}{}{The Dragon is dead. Yeah!}
{140}{}{Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::}
{141}{}{Isn't there more to life than this?}
{142}{}{We're smarter than you think.}
{143}{}{Look! A lao wai!}
{144}{}{The Emperor's mouthpiece! Dead! The city will fall apart!}
{145}{}{What happens now?}
{146}{}{I hope the savages don't overrun us now.}
{147}{}{The good always die young.}
{148}{}{I hope we can survive without Ken Lee.}
{149}{}{I hear that Ken Lee was the only one who kept the Emperor in line.}
{150}{}{I hear that the Emperor was only a façade for Ken Lee. }
{151}{}{Maybe Lo Pan could take Ken Lee's spot...}
{152}{}{Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::}
{153}{}{Isn't there more to life than this?}
{154}{}{We're smarter than you think.}
{155}{}{Look! A lao wai!}

{163}{}{You killed AHS-9? Yeah!}
{164}{}{Those Hubologists give me the creeps.}
{165}{}{You have done us a great service.}
{166}{}{Death to the Hubologists!}
{167}{}{This will hurry those Hubologists out of here.}
{168}{}{Stupid Hubologists, can't even protect their own leader.}
{169}{}{The Hubologists better not come after us in revenge.}
{170}{}{I guess you're not a spy.}
{171}{}{Son of a pig! Die!}
{172}{}{You have dishonored your family!}
{173}{}{Leave us alone, lao wai!}
{174}{}{Haven't you done enough damage?}
{175}{}{I hate you!}
{176}{}{Leave this city!}
{177}{}{Go home to your people!}
{178}{}{Do not darken my life with your face!}
{179}{}{What will it take to get rid of you?}
{180}{}{Help! Help!}
