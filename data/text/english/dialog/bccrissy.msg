{100}{}{You see a young woman.}
{101}{}{You see Chrissy, Rebecca's daughter.}
{102}{}{You see a pretty young woman. She looks confident and able to handle herself in a fight.}
{103}{}{If you're here to try and rape me, you're going to be wearing your balls as a bow tie. Get it?}
{104}{}{Let me guess. The guys are tired of me kicking them where it hurts, so they sent you in here to
 do something obscene. Well, I can hurt you just as bad; I just need to kick higher. Get it?}
{105}{}{Bow tie?}
{106}{}{}
{107}{}{What go on here? Who you?}
{108}{}{}
{109}{}{I'd like to know who you are and what is going on here.}
{110}{}{Yeah. A fancy piece of cloth worn around the neck for decoration. It's like a scarf, but for
 men. Now, just imagine me kicking you SO hard that you end up wearing your dangly about your neck. Get
 it?}
{111}{}{Me understand. You no hurt me.}
{112}{}{I got the picture; please don't hurt me.}
{113}{}{Okay, so why are you here?}
{114}{}{}
{115}{}{Me want know what go on here? Who you?}
{116}{}{}
{117}{}{I'd like to know who you are and what is going on here.}
{118}{}{Really? Awesome! Let's go.}
{119}{}{Okay.}
{120}{}{In a nutshell, my name is Chrissy and I'm from the Squat. I was out exploring last week when I
 found that entrance out there. I thought it might be an abandoned mine or something, so I decided to
 check it out. Well, it's not a mine; it's a secret entrance into Vault 15. The vault is being
 used as a base for a band of raiders called the Khans. They caught me snooping around and their leader, Darion, had me locked up in here.}
{121}{}{Okay. Me take you home.}
{122}{}{All right, I'll take you home.}
{123}{}{Well, I'll be damned. Today must be my lucky day. To what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you
 again?}
{124}{}{}
{125}{}{What go on here? Who you?}
{126}{}{}
{127}{}{I'd like to know who you are and what is going on here.}
{128}{}{Please take me to my mother, Rebecca.}
{129}{}{My knight in shining armor returns. Well, it would shine if you'd clean it every once in a
 while. Oh, and you might want to consider bathing yourself as well. So, what can I do for you?}
{130}{}{Me just say hi. Me go now.}
{131}{}{Just thought I'd say hello. I'll be going now.}
{132}{}{Hey, I know I have a smart mouth, but I want you to know that I'm very grateful for you saving
 my butt. Thanks very much!}
{133}{}{You welcome.}
{134}{}{You're welcome.}

{135}{}{The people of the Squat are protecting these guys by helping them keep the vault a secret, but they
 don't know what's really going on here. Darion told us that the vault was being repaired so we could have
 a safe place to live with lots of food and water, but it's all a lie. I've been in there and looked
 around. The vault is dead, and the food and water machines don't work. Our food and water's been coming
 from the spoils
 of raids against caravans.}
{136}{}{Look, I've got to go home and warn everyone about what's really going on here. We can't help these
 monsters. Will you take me home?}
