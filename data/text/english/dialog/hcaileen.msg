{100}{}{You see a mildly attractive middle-aged woman.}
{101}{}{You see Aileen, one of the town's chemists.}
{102}{}{You see a mildly attractive middle-aged woman. She looks tough and capable. Her hands are stained with chemicals.}
{103}{}{Thanks for helping the cause.}
{104}{}{I'm glad you're one of us.}
{105}{}{We'll show those muties.}
{106}{}{Up with human rights, comrade.}
{107}{}{You've got the right stuff.}
{108}{}{Get out of here.}
{109}{}{Mutie-lover.}
{110}{}{You just better keep your mouth shut, if you know what's good for you.}
{111}{}{Damn mutant-sympathizer.}
{112}{}{Why don't you go back to your mutant friends?}
{113}{}{Human solidarity, comrade.}
{114}{}{It's us against them.}
{115}{}{You picked the winning side.}
{116}{}{Those muties are going down.}
{117}{}{We'll show those mutants who's boss.}
{118}{}{Even muties can't breathe poison.}
{119}{}{Humanity's hour is at hand.}
{120}{}{I just love the idea of muties choking to death.}
{121}{}{Our victory is almost here.}
{122}{}{Soon, Broken Hills will be ours.}
{123}{}{Damn mutie lover.}
{124}{}{Get out of here.}
{125}{}{You're just an imperialist mutant lackey.}
{126}{}{You sure chose wrong this time.}
{127}{}{You'll regret what you've done here.}
{128}{}{Git out, you tainted idjit.}
{129}{}{You must be part mutant.}
{130}{}{Get out of here, impure one.}
{131}{}{Stupid fool. Get out of here.}
{132}{}{I don't have time for the likes of you.}
{133}{}{Talk to Jacob if you want something.}
{134}{}{My husband Jacob can take care of your needs.}
{135}{}{Uh, could you please stop pestering me?}
{136}{}{I can't help you, but my husband, Jacob, can.}
{137}{}{Just leave me alone.}
{138}{}{Nice of you to visit. Now get out.}
{139}{}{Why'd you track in all that mud?}
{140}{}{Would you act that way in your own, uh, tent?}
{141}{}{Please leave me alone.}
{142}{}{I don't know what you want, but I wish you'd just leave me alone.}
{143}{}{We were set up! We didn't kill those people in the tunnels!}
