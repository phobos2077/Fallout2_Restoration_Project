{100}{}{You see a diligent-looking guard. The guard is outfitted in metal armor
 and is carrying an assault rifle.}
{101}{}{You see a Vault City guard.}
{102}{}{Yes? What is it?}
{103}{}{Me go inta big HOL in side of hill}
{104}{}{I'd like to enter the Vault.}
{105}{}{Nothing, sorry to bother you.}
{106}{}{It is past 6 PM. You need to leave.}
{107}{}{Okay. I'm leaving.}
{108}{}{Okay. I just need another minute.}
{109}{}{I got things to do. I'll go when I'm ready to.}
{110}{}{Umag Nak!?! Umag NAK!}
{111}{}{I will summon some of the guards to escort you out.}
{112}{}{Okay. Let's go.}
{113}{}{Brog Frup}
{114}{}{Don't bother. I can find my own way.}
{115}{}{I apologize, but these are my orders.}
{116}{}{Okay... but I'm not happy about it. I may be forced to file a formal
 complain--}
{117}{}{Well, I'm staying.}
{118}{}{I do not want to use force, but I will if necessary. Do not make this any
 more difficult than this has to be.}
{119}{}{Okay, fine, fine... I'll go.}
{120}{}{You so much as touch me, and you'll be wearing your ass as a hat.}
{121}{}{Hello, Citizen. May I help you?}
{122}{}{I'd like to enter the Vault.}
{123}{}{Me go inta HOL in side of hill}
{124}{}{Nothing right now.}
{125}{}{I'm sorry, only Citizens are permitted to enter the Vault. I'm sure you
 understand.}
{126}{}{Only Citizens may enter. Now leave.}
{127}{}{Okay.}
{128}{}{Umgh}
{129}{}{Of course. Please pass through.}
{130}{}{Thankee!}
{131}{}{Thank you.}
{132}{}{Yes? May I help you?}
{133}{}{I'd like to enter the Vault.}
{134}{}{Nothing, sorry to disturb you.}
{135}{}{I apologize, but only Citizens may enter the Vault.}
{136}{}{I *am* a Citizen.}
{137}{}{I'm sorry... I don't recognize you. I'm under orders to only let Citizens I know into the Vault.
 Perhaps First Citizen Lynette can help you. Good day.}
{138}{}{Hello, Captain. Can I help you?}
{139}{}{Oh, okay.}
{140}{}{Oh, sure. I was just looking.}
{141}{}{Umgh}
{142}{}{Yeah, whatever, Mungoth. Talk to the hand.}
{143}{}{You there! What is that ghoul doing here in Vault City?!}
{144}{}{You there! What is that mutant doing here in Vault City?!}
{145}{}{Breep-oop foop foop}
{146}{}{A ghoul? Where?}
{147}{}{A mutant? Where?}
{148}{}{He's with me.}
{149}{}{He's traveling with me. If any of you racists have a problem with that, maybe we should settle it right here and now.}
{150}{}{If that creature is with you, then you both belong back out in the Courtyard, not in the Vault City streets.}
{151}{}{All right, we'll go peacefully.}
{152}{}{Why don't you try to escort us out of here? I guarantee it'll be an educational experience.}
{153}{}{How do these Outworlders get in here in the first place...?}
{154}{}{That creature there.}
{155}{}{You both belong back out in the Courtyard, not in the Vault City streets.}
{156}{}{ME NO GOH HIM FREN! U NO FREN!}
{157}{}{We go we go quiet-lee}
{158}{}{All right, we'll go peacefully.}
{159}{}{He's traveling with me. If any of you racists have a problem with that, maybe we should settle it right here and now.}
{160}{}{Guards! Intruders in the City!}
{161}{}{Hrnghhhhhhhh!}
{162}{}{You're going to be dead before those friends of yours show up.}
{163}{}{Hey! You're the one who defeated the Enclave!}
{164}{}{Look, it's the one who defeated the Enclave!}
{165}{}{Welcome to Vault City.}
{166}{}{Your battle against the Enclave impressed even the First Citizen.}
{167}{}{I heard you've traveled as far south as San Francisco. Is that true?}
{168}{}{Is it true that the U.S. was still fighting the war?}
{169}{}{You should catalog your travels in the Vault City computer.}
{170}{}{You're welcome to stay in Vault City as long as you want.}
{171}{}{You should catalog your exploits against the Enclave and put it up on the List Server.}
{172}{}{Captain.}
{173}{}{Vault City prevails, Captain.}
{174}{}{Hello, Captain.}
{175}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
