{100}{}{You see a very tall and lanky trapper.}
{101}{}{You see Slim Picket, the head of Trapper Town.}

{110}{}{Well, mister, you sure don't look chewed up by those rats yet -- but you will if you keep
 pestering them. Just don't bring any back here with you.}
{111}{}{Well, little missy, you sure don't look chewed up by those rats yet -- but you will if you keep
 pestering them. Just don't bring any back here with you.}
{112}{}{Don't worry. I won't.}
{113}{}{No, thanks to you.}
{114}{}{Uh, ok.}

{120}{}{I just don't want to have anything to do with those critters. I leave 'em alone and hope they'll
 do the same for me. Take care now.}

{130}{}{Just be careful. Seems the deeper you go, the bigger they get back there.}

{140}{}{Hello, tribal. My name's Slim Picket and you can talk to me about Trapper Town. We don't want
 any trouble here.}
{141}{}{Hello there, friend. Nice of you to visit all of us here. My name's Slim Picket. I talk for
 Trapper Town.}
{142}{}{Hello there Slim. My name's }
{143}{}{. Why do you call this Trapper Town?}
{144}{}{Do you know where I could find something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{145}{}{Nice to meet you, Mr. Picket. I'm just looking around for now, though. Goodbye.}

{150}{}{Hello there, my name's Slim Picket. I speak for this part of town. }
{151}{}{Gruk.}
{152}{}{Ook, oople.}
{153}{}{(point at self) Me }
{154}{}{, me hungry}

{160}{}{Say, your antenna don't pick up all the channels do it? Well, I tell you what. Here's
 a key to that door behind me. There's all kinds of rats back there - even one big
 one s'posedly. You go through there and kill all the dang rats you can eat. How's that?}
{161}{}{That big ol' rat that was bothering everyone hereabouts seems to have disappeared. But
 I don't reckon that an idjit like you had anything to do with it.}
{162}{}{OK. Heh, heh, rat kill. Heh, heh, heh.}
{163}{}{No! Rats scaaarrrry! No. Me go now.}

{170}{}{What the heck do you want this time?}
{171}{}{Hi there. How can I help you out?}
{172}{}{I think I need a key to get into the north part of Trapper Town.}
{173}{}{I've got some questions that I wanted to ask you.}
{174}{}{I guess I don't need anything. Goodbye.}

{180}{}{Well, this here part of town is where all of us trappers live when we're not out trapping
 geckos. Only problem about the free digs are the rats on the north side. But we have most of the
 entrances to that part of the mall barricaded pretty good.}
{181}{}{What did you want to know about?}
{182}{}{Do you ever go to the north side?}
{183}{}{Tell me about trapping geckos.}
{184}{}{Do you know anything about a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{185}{}{You sure have a lot of cars here.}
{186}{}{Rats? Tell me more about rats.}
{187}{}{Thanks for the info. I don't think I need to know about anything else. Goodbye.}

{190}{}{Oh, you mean a GECK. huh? Well, I saw an ad for one of those in an old magazine. But I don't
 think they exist anymore. Certainly not around here, anyplace.}
{191}{}{Really? Well, tell me about something else then.}
{192}{}{Oh, well; that's all I wanted to know. Thanks.}

{200}{}{You want the key to the north side of Trapper Town? What do you want that for?}
{201}{}{You still want that key? Why?}
{202}{}{I'm an explorer; I want to explore everyplace I can. Besides, maybe there's a GECK forgotten
 on a back shelf in there.}
{203}{}{I'm going to help you with your rat problem.}
{204}{}{I just want to try to get to that car on the other side of the fence.}
{205}{}{I'd be willing to give anything to get that key. I really want to get to the other side of
 Trapper Town.}
{206}{}{I guess I wouldn't want a key. It sounds as though it's pretty dangerous over there.}

{210}{}{Well, OK, here's the key. Just don't go stirring up too much trouble back there, and make sure
 you close the door behind you.}
{211}{}{What a hoot! I sure needed that, sweetheart. You just make sure that nothing happens to that
 pretty little tail of yours, now. (heh, hee, hee)}
{212}{}{Thanks for the key, Slim. Before I go, I have some questions for you.}
{213}{}{Thanks, Slim. I'll make sure the door's closed behind me. Goodbye.}

{220}{}{If you want the key, you're going to have to buy it from me.}
{221}{}{I don't mind trading for the key.}
{222}{}{I don't want to trade for the key. It won't cost you anything to let me borrow it. I'll make
 sure to close the door after myself.}
{223}{}{If you let me have the key, I'm sure that you'll have fewer rats to worry about after I use it.}
{224}{}{I don't think I want the key. Goodbye.}

{230}{}{I guess you got what you wanted. Just be careful now.}
{231}{}{Thanks.}
{232}{}{You drive a hard bargain. I hope it was worth it.}

{240}{}{Well, I guess you didn't need that key as much as you thought, huh? You sure you got what you
 wanted?}
{241}{}{Oops; I knew there was something else I wanted.}
{242}{}{Hey, Slim, I have a couple of things that I wanted to ask you about.}
{243}{}{I don't need anything else from you. Thanks anyhow.}

{250}{}{We blocked off all the entrances to the north side of town except one. I have a key to that one
 entrance -- just in case anyone needs to get over there for any reason. I can't figure out why anyone
 would want to, though; I sure wouldn't.}
{251}{}{Interesting; tell me something else.}
{252}{}{I'm interested in getting that key from you.}
{253}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{260}{}{You're interested in trapping, huh? (He looks you up and down.)}
{261}{}{[MORE]}

{270}{}{I don't think I'd try it if I were you. You might get your hands all dirty and callused.
 (heh, hee, hee) Anything else you want to know about?}
{271}{}{Well, I sure wouldn't want to get my hands dirty. Tell me something else.}
{272}{}{I sure wish I was as skillful a trapper as you are. I bet you could teach me a lot.}
{273}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{280}{}{Well, now you look like you could handle yourself. Geckos come in two types -- regular or
 golden. The regular ones are easy to trap and hunt, but the golden ones are worth more money.}
{281}{}{Tell me more about the golden geckos.}
{282}{}{Interesting. Tell me something else.}
{283}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{290}{}{The golden ones are sneaky and twice as vicious as the regular ones. Plus, once they bite you
 they'll hold on and gnaw through to the bone. And that's not even counting their poison. But their
 hides look real nice, and so they're worth a lot more. }
{291}{}{Tell me more.}

{300}{}{One real good trapper, name of Smiley, went north looking for wherever they come from. He was
 convinced that they all came from one place. Thing is, nobody's heard from him for a couple months now.}
{301}{}{What do you think happened to him?}

{310}{}{Maybe he found where they come from and got all ate up. (heh, hee, hee) But I tell you one
 thing: Mrs. Buckner's heart just about broke when he didn't come back. You see, he was her beau. Mrs.
 Buckner runs Buckner house, y'know.}
{311}{}{Interesting. Tell me something else.}
{312}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{320}{}{We have a whole lot full of cars. All ready for their owners to come back from shopping. Thing
 is, they never did. Not a dang one of 'em runs, though. There's a real beauty of a Chrysalis Motors
 Highwayman just east of here, but I haven't figured out how to get to it, yet.}
{321}{}{A Highwayman? Interesting. Tell me about something else.}
{322}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{330}{}{Well, they taste pretty good if you spit-roast 'em with just a pinch of herbs. But most of the
 time they can be a real nuisance, and they're getting worse. We've barricaded the north part of the
 mall -- well, Trapper Town, that is -- but they're sneaking through anyway. There's one door right here
 behind my room, but I have it locked.}
{331}{}{At home, mom just used to pan-fry them with a little butter. But, tell me more about the rat
 attacks.}
{332}{}{Interesting. Tell me about something else.}
{333}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{335}{}{Well they taste pretty good if you spit-roast 'em with just a titch of herbs. But most
 of the time they can be a real nuisance, and they're getting worse. We've barricaded
 the north side of town but they're sneaking through anyway. There's one door to the north side, right here, but
 I have it locked.}
{336}{}{Well, there used to be a real bad rat problem hereabouts, but lately, there jist ain't so
 many rats about. It's like they all got skeered and bugged outa here.}
{337}{}{At home mom just used to pan-fry them with a little butter. But, tell me more about
 the rat attacks.}

{340}{}{People been disappearing. Just them that are slow and sickly, for now. 'Course, they
 don't stop to cook their food like us. They just gnaw it into a few bloody clumps of hair and
 rags. Least that's all we find in the morning. I've even heard talk that there's some kind of
 giant rat god that tells 'em all what to do.}
{341}{}{Interesting. Maybe someone should do something about that. Say, do you have a key to
 the north side of Trapper Town?}
{342}{}{Interesting. Tell me about something else.}
{343}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{350}{}{Well, you ain't that pretty, but it's sure been a long time. I guess I could give you the key
 as long as you give me what I need. (heh, hee, hee)}
{351}{}{Well, you sure are a pretty li'l thing, ain't you? I'm sure we can get you that key you want.
 You just have to give me something I want. (heh, hee, hee)}
{352}{}{OK, but I just hope they call you Slim because of your height.}
{353}{}{Uh, that's not exactly what I had in mind.}
{354}{}{Wipe that leer off your face. I think I just better leave before you get hurt. Goodbye.}

{360}{}{I could teach you something about the outdoors. But it's going to cost you $100.}
{361}{}{I'm always happy to share my skill with others. I can teach you some tricks for only $50.}
{362}{}{Well, you better have a lot to teach me for that.}
{363}{}{That's a lot of money. Just tell me what you know about other things.}
{364}{}{I don't think I need to learn anything right now. Goodbye.}

{370}{}{Your tribe are mostly farmers aren't they? I don't think I could teach you a darn thing.}
{371}{}{I'm that good already, huh? Well, tell me about something else then.}
{372}{}{I think I'll be going then. Goodbye.}

{380}{}{Well, that ought to have learned you a thing or three about the great out-of-doors. Hope you
 can put it to good use. Remember about the scat now.}
{381}{}{You're right. Old scat doesn't taste near the same as fresh. Thanks, Slim. Now tell me more
 about those geckos.}
{382}{}{Thank you for all the tips, Slim, but I still think just smelling the scat is good enough. I
 was wondering about something else, though.}
{383}{}{Thanks for the information, Slim. I'm going to go and practice right now. Goodbye.}

{390}{}{Tell me about those rats.}

{400}{}{You shore took the fight outta them rats.}
{401}{}{Hello there. Nice to live in a rat-free envi-ro-ment.}
{402}{}{Yup. Fewer rats 'an ever now.}
{403}{}{Wonder what happened to the rats?}
{404}{}{Good riddance to rodent rubbish.}
{405}{}{You're jist a regular Pied Piper, ain't cha? Thankee.}
{406}{}{No way. I will only trade this here key for something you got. No fast talk.}
