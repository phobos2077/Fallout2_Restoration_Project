{100}{}{You see Klint, a fellow tribesman.}
{101}{}{You see Klint.}
{102}{}{You see a young man with bulging muscles and a very confident air about him.}
{103}{}{Good day to you, }
{104}{}{. You have not completed the trial of the Elder and may not pass.}
{105}{}{Uh...}
{106}{}{I need to go back to the village.}
{107}{}{I have some questions for you.}
{108}{}{All right, I'm off to take the test.}
{109}{}{(sigh) }
{110}{}{. You go temple. You take test. You not come back here until take test. Obey Elder. Go!}
{111}{}{Me go.}
{112}{}{Forgive me, }
{113}{}{, but I cannot allow you to pass. If you wish to return to the village you may do so only by passing the trial set before you.}
{114}{}{I see. I guess I'll be going then.}
{115}{}{Can I ask you some questions then?}
{116}{}{I could kick your ass and just walk out of here.}
{117}{}{Forgive me, but I have no answers to your questions. Take the trial set before you by the Elder and prove yourself worthy to lead our people.}
{118}{}{Very well.}
{119}{}{Two people working together can move the obelisk that blocks the path. Alone, you would fail. I have no intention of helping you until you pass the trial of the Elder.}
{120}{}{Uh-huh. I get the picture.}
{121}{}{Greetings, Chosen One! It is good to see you. How may I serve you?}
{122}{}{Me say hi. That all.}
{123}{}{Just thought I'd say hello. I'll be leaving on my quest soon.}
{124}{}{May the spirits of our ancestors protect you, Chosen One. I wish you well on your journey.}
