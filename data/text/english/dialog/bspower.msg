{100}{}{The generator is functioning normally. Power output is optimal.}
{101}{}{The generator seems to be in an emergency stand-by mode. The power output is minimal.}
{102}{}{Try to diagnose the problem.}
{103}{}{Oh well. Gotta go.}
{104}{}{There must have been a short in the system at some time. The emergency circuit breakers kicked

{105}{}{You can't seem to find anything wrong. It just doesn't work.}
{106}{}{Try to repair it.}
{107}{}{Time to leave.}
{108}{}{You manage to break the contacts loose and restore power!}
{109}{}{Damn. This is tougher than it looks.}
{110}{}{Done.}
