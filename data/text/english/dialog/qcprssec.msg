{109}{}{I need some mouthwash.}
{110}{}{Where's that washcloth?}
{111}{}{I think it's time for a raise.}
{112}{}{Do those Secret Service agents always have to hover like that?}
{113}{}{Come back later. I'm gonna be busy in a minute here.}
{114}{}{I don't think I'll wash this dress - it might come in handy.}
