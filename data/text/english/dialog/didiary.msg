{100}{}{You see an old diary.}
{101}{}{It appears to be a diary which belonged to a young girl. The writing on the inside cover says: "Property of Anna"
 Most of the pages are either torn or faded, but one is still readable. "Day 271: Today my mother gave me a gold locket.
 It is the most beautiful thing I have ever owned. I will never part with it."}
{102}{}{The old diary is too frail to keep handling.}
