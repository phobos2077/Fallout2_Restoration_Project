# 29. Wait I know... (From 25)
{530}{}{Wait! I know. Tell you what, I'll give you $100 and you spot me for the other $100 I owe Becky. I'll pay you back real soon.}

{532}{}{No deal.}

# 30. Amount of Loan (From 28)
{540}{}{Just $50. Please! It's all part of the master plan!}

{561}{}{Okay.}
{562}{}{No.}

# 33. Becky sent PC (From 18)
