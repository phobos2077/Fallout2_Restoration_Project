{100}{}{You see a dumpy-looking bald guy, polishing a glass.}
{101}{}{It's the bartender.}
{102}{}{He's a gruff-looking guy with a crooked nose and pinched up ears like he might have been a boxer years ago.}
{103}{}{What can I get you?}
{104}{}{Say, you're the one who got Jack to give up, ain't you? That was good work. So what do you want?}
{105}{}{Sure.}
{106}{}{Drink.}
{107}{}{Who's the big guy over there?}
{108}{}{What's to do in this town?}
{109}{}{Goodbye.}
{110}{}{That's Hoss, President Tandi's boy. Born trouble when he's drinking, so I'd stay clear of him if I were you.}
{111}{}{That was Hoss, President's Tandi's son. Boy, you sure whooped his ass good!}
{112}{}{President Tandi?}
{113}{}{Tough guy, eh? Thanks.}
{114}{}{Not much. If you're looking for trouble, go drink someplace else, like the Rawhide. If you're looking for work, there's the Westin place west of town. Heard some things about President Tandi looking for a specialist, too.}
{115}{}{Specialist?}
{116}{}{President Tandi?}
{117}{}{Thanks.}
{118}{}{Daughter of President Aradesh, the guy who founded NCR. She's been president for years. Does a good job too.}
{119}{}{And she's looking for a specialist? What kind?}
{120}{}{Who's the big guy?}
{121}{}{Thanks.}
{122}{}{Don't know. Gunther, her aide, probably does. He's down at the Hall of Congress.}
{123}{}{Who's the big guy?}
{124}{}{Thanks.}
{125}{}{Would you like a drink?}
{126}{}{Sure.}
{127}{}{No.}
{128}{}{Let me buy you a drink! I've been wanting to smack him around for years!}
{129}{}{I've got some questions.}
{130}{}{Good! Bye.}

{131}{}{Boy, you sure whooped Hoss's ass good! What can I get you?}
