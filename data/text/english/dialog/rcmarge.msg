{100}{}{You see a burly, middle-aged woman covered with rock-dust.}
{101}{}{You see Marge LeBarge, owner of the Kokoweef Mine.}
{102}{}{You see a strong, durable woman with an air of authority.}
{103}{}{Sorry, I don't have time for charity cases right now.}
{104}{}{Come back when that head-wound heals up.}
{105}{}{I'm surprised that you can walk and talk at the same time.}
{106}{}{Looks like your belt doesn't go through all the loops.}
{107}{}{You're just a few clowns short of a circus, aren't you?}
{108}{}{You aren't exactly my favorite person right now.}
{109}{}{Hey, thanks for getting me that excavator chip. Things are really going smooth for the Kokoweef
 Mine now.}
{110}{}{I'll give you $1,000 for that excavator chip.}
{111}{}{Have any luck getting that excavator chip?}
{112}{}{Yeah, well, sorry about that. But you can't please all of the people all of the time.}
{113}{}{Always happy to get a job that pays that well. Let me ask you about something else.}
{114}{}{How'd you know that I had the excavator chip on me?}
{115}{}{How much is it worth to you?}
{116}{}{If I had it, you'd be among the first to know.}
{117}{}{I think I'll be moving on now. Goodbye.}
{118}{}{Hey, thanks for breaking up that brawl. Sometimes my miners get a little out of line, but they're
 a good sort when they're not all Jetted up.}
{119}{}{Thanks for putting those Morningstar troublemakers behind bars. That's where they belong. How
 can I help you?}
{120}{}{I can't believe you'd put any of my boys in jail. I'm sure that those damn Morningstar thugs
 started that fight. Now what do you want?}
{121}{}{I sure wish you hadn't jailed my miners like that. Just jailing those Morningstar hooligans
 would have kept the peace in town. What do you want?}
{122}{}{You sure know how to spank a baby with an axe, don't you? Nobody needed to die over a bar-brawl.
 Just what the hell do you want from me, anyway?}
{123}{}{Who are you?}
{124}{}{I wanted to ask you about something.}
{125}{}{I was just walking past. I think I'll keep walking. Goodbye.}
{126}{}{Hello there. I'm Marge. Marge LeBarge, and I run this mine.}
{127}{}{What can Marge do you for?}
{128}{}{What do you mine here?}
{129}{}{Have you ever heard of something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{130}{}{Are you a Redding native?}
{131}{}{Know about any jobs or anything else going on here?}
{132}{}{I was just looking around a bit. Goodbye.}
{133}{}{Gold, of course. We mine it right here at the Kokoweef, and then ship it to Vault City, New Reno,
 and the New California Republic.}
{134}{}{You send it all over the place?}
{135}{}{Why did you call your mine Kokoweef?}
{136}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{137}{}{I see. Thanks. That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{138}{}{Sure do. Everyone likes gold. You should talk to the caravan master, James Hoffy, if you're real
 curious about it.}
{139}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{140}{}{Thanks, I'll do that. Goodbye.}
{141}{}{A Garden of Eden Creation Kit, huh? Sounds pretty impressive. If I had something like that you
 sure wouldn't find me grubbing around in the dirt to make ends meet, now would you?}
{142}{}{I guess not. Let me ask you something else.}
{143}{}{I just thought I'd ask. Goodbye.}
{144}{}{Heck no. I was born way up north. Right on the edge of a lake. Lake LeBarge, it was.}
{145}{}{I've never heard of that. Let me ask you something else.}
{146}{}{Sounds nice. Maybe I'll go hunt that place down. Goodbye for now.}
{147}{}{Just some rumors is all.}
{148}{}{Well, there's always rumors... but I do have something that needs doing.}
{149}{}{I'll get back to that. Let me ask you about something else first, though.}
{150}{}{Tell me about the rumors.}
{151}{}{What's that?}
{152}{}{I bet you do. Sorry, but I'm too busy right now. Goodbye.}
{153}{}{I've got a great big ol' digger machine down in my mine. Problem is that the control chip for it
 don't work anymore. I need a new one if I want to expand my operations.}
{154}{}{That's interesting, but how do I fit in?}
{155}{}{The Great Wanamingo Mine, just west of town, should have one of those same excavator machines.
 It's been abandoned for quite a while, so I'm guessing that they still have a working chip in their
 machine.}
{156}{}{Sounds pretty easy. How come you haven't done it already?}
{157}{}{It isn't as easy as all that. You see, the Great Wanamingo Mine's haunted. People go there and
 they don't come back. That's the big reason it's been shut down. Used to be a high-roller type place.
 Not any more, though.}
{158}{}{So, you want me to get the digging machine chip out of this mine. What's it worth to you?}
{159}{}{I'll give you $1,000 for that chip. McGrew over at the Morningstar'd probably give you the same,
 but he's all for those damn New Reno thugs. I can't stand those violent bastards. So let me give you the
 money, okay?}
{160}{}{We'll see. One thing, though... that's good money. That mine must be pretty dangerous.}
{161}{}{Well, it isn't a cakewalk, sweetheart. But you look like someone who can take care of
 themselves. Anyhow, you bring me the chip and you get the cash. Interested?}
{162}{}{Yeah. I'm interested. Sign me up.}
{163}{}{Well, I'll think about it. Goodbye for now.}
{164}{}{Great. The sooner you get back here with the excavator chip, the better.}
{165}{}{I'll see what I can do. First, let me ask you about something else.}
{166}{}{Okay, I'll see you around. Goodbye.}
{167}{}{Well, there's always the usual rumors about Redding being taken over, or about Wanamingos
 coming out of the graveyard at night. Heck, someone even said that they saw some kind of flying
 machine go overhead a few months ago.}
{168}{}{What else were you curious about?}
{169}{}{What did you hear about a takeover?}
{170}{}{What's a Wanamingo?}
{171}{}{A flying machine?}
{172}{}{I guess people talk about the same kind of stuff everywhere. Tell me about something else.}
{173}{}{I'd love to listen but I've got to be going. Goodbye.}
{174}{}{Well, people always talk about Vault City taking over to get our gold. Or one of the families in
 New Reno getting everyone hooked on their dope in order to take over. Or even the NCR wanting to annex
 us. I tell you, the NCR's our best bet - but they're all just out for our gold. Redding's still
 independent, so far.}
{175}{}{What about the other rumors?}
{176}{}{I guess that's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{177}{}{A Wanamingo's just the single orneriest critter there is. Tall as two men, stronger than a bull
 brahmin, and with flappin' suckers instead of arms. Can't be hurt with guns, neither. S'posedly, injuns
 called 'em up for revenge on the white-man for what the war did. I don't put much stock in that, though.}
{178}{}{What about the other rumors?}
{179}{}{I guess that's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{180}{}{Oh, yeah. Well, a couple of my miners were flying a bit themselves - Jetting around, if you catch
 my drift - a while back. They swore up-and-down that they saw a ship fly past, going southwest.}
{181}{}{What about the other rumors?}
{182}{}{I guess that's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{183}{}{Well, Dan and his Morningstar boys favor those mobsters from New Reno. I guess that Redding'll be
 one big Jet addict slum before too long.}
{184}{}{Not really my concern. Tell me about something else.}
{185}{}{Oh well. Goodbye.}
{186}{}{In a town this size, everyone knows more than they want to about everyone else. So how about it?}
{187}{}{How much were you going to give me for it?}
{188}{}{$1,000. Right here, right now. You want it or not?}
{189}{}{OK, I'll take it. Here's the chip.}
{190}{}{I don't think I want to sell right now.}
{191}{}{Think you'll get a better offer? Think again, pal. I don't think you'll find a better offer. But
 I guess it's your time.}
{192}{}{All right, I'll sell it to you. Here's the chip.}
{193}{}{I think I'd still like to look around a bit more. Goodbye.}
{194}{}{You made the right choice. Thanks. I'm going to get right on this so we can put that excavator
 machine to work.}
{195}{}{Great. Hey, let me ask you something else first, though.}
{196}{}{Thanks for the cash. Goodbye.}
{197}{}{Yeah? Gee, thanks. I'm getting all warm and cuddly feeling inside. What do you want?}
{198}{}{I want to ask you about something.}
{199}{}{Nothing. I'm just looking around. Goodbye.}
{200}{}{Why not? Actually, I don't know where the name came from. I think it's always been called that.
 Even before I got here. It's got kind of a romantic sound to it, don't it? Ko-ko-weef. Yeah, I still
 like the way that sounds.}
{201}{}{Uh, yeah. Okay. Uh, what did you say you mine here?}
{202}{}{Uh huh. Well I'll be leaving now. Goodbye.}
