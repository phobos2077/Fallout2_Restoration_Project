{115}{}{Doctor not want Ratt to get rid of bugs? Okay, Ratt save nice bugs for Doctor to eat.}
{116}{}{I don't want to eat them, you fool! I just don't want to watch you eat them.}
{117}{}{Ratt not eat bugs?}
{118}{}{That's right, DON'T EAT BUGS IN FRONT OF ME. I don't care for that nasty crunching sound.}

{127}{}{No Doctor, no. Ratt not do that again. Ratt remember.}
{128}{}{Just see that you keep yourself busy, or I'll whip you again. }
{129}{}{NO! Doctor, no whip Ratt. Ratt be good now.}
{130}{}{Mind you, I don't enjoy it. But you need the discipline, Rattray. You certainly do.}
{131}{}{Yes, Doctor. Doctor always know best for Ratt.}
{132}{}{As long as you remember that, Rattray. God knows why I take such pains with you.}
{133}{}{Doctor nice man, very nice man.}
