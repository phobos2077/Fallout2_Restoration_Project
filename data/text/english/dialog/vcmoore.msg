{100}{}{You see a wild-eyed man. Despite his unkempt hair and scruffy beard, his clothes look clean and
 well-cared for.}
{101}{}{You see Thomas Moore.}
{102}{}{You see Thomas Moore. Despite his unkempt hair and scruffy beard, his clothes look clean and
 well-cared for.}
{103}{}{Hello and welcome, traveler! Have you heard the word today?}
{104}{}{Uurmph}
{105}{}{Ecch}
{106}{}{Portzebie}
{107}{}{Shamble off}
{108}{}{Why, no... I haven't.}
{109}{}{And you are...?}
{110}{}{Uh, no, and I don't want to. Goodbye. }
{111}{}{The word, my friend... the word is SELFISHNESS. Mix in a slew
 of arrogance, and what do you have? Vault City... in all its self-righteous,
 slave-trading glory.}
{112}{}{Why do you live here if you hate it so much?}
{113}{}{Amen, brother!}
{114}{}{I think I've heard enough. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{Go sell crazy somewhere else, pal... we're all stocked up here.}
{116}{}{Yes! }
{117}{}{It is TIME to hear the wailing of our kin outside these walls and let them in! We have more
 than enough to feed and shelter our brothers... we need not be rich when so MANY are poor.}
{118}{}{I hear you!}
{119}{}{At last, someone who speaks sense! Why must others suffer when aid lies within these walls?}
{120}{}{I've heard enough. Goodbye.}
{121}{}{Friend... as I look upon you today, I see STRENGTH. I see
 FAITH. Do my eyes deceive me? Or do they see a kindred soul that shares my cause?}
{122}{}{Damn right!}
{123}{}{Yes! Know that it is TIME... time for this city, built on sin and slavery, to open its gates
 to everyone! }
{124}{}{I have to leave. Good talking... er, listening, to you.}
{125}{}{Then let me ask you this, my friend -
 to what LENGTHS would you go to spread the word?}
{126}{}{Well, that depends on how much money you have on you..."friend."}
{127}{}{No lengths are too long... no distance too great, when the cause is just, and the word is true.
 Whatever needs be done, I will do it!}
{128}{}{I don't like the direction this conversation is going. Good day.}
{129}{}{Even though it may mean banishment from this oasis?}
{130}{}{This is no oasis, my brother. It is a city, built on selfishness and greed. It needs to be
 saved from itself... in that light, is banishment too high a price? I think not.}
{131}{}{Anything to release my fellow man from his bonds!}
{132}{}{I don't know... what are you asking me to do?}
{133}{}{Hmmm. Well, since you put it that way, no, I guess not. Good day.}
{134}{}{(Leans in.) I have a briefcase... with information vital to our cause.
 Will you deliver it to New Reno for me? I would do it, but the Citizens here are watching me...}
{135}{}{So, you admit you have ties to New Reno, eh? That's gonna cost you... "friend."}
{136}{}{Sure. Give it to me.}
{137}{}{No thanks... that's a little too risky to me. Count me out.}
{138}{}{Here it is... deliver
 this to a man, John Bishop, in New Reno. Tread carefully, my child, and carry the word with you.}
{139}{}{Deliver this briefcase to John Bishop? No problem.}
{140}{}{My name? I am Thomas Moore, preacher of the word and the truth. And what brings you to me
 today, friend? Do YOU seek the word?}
{141}{}{The word?}
{142}{}{Uh, no, not today, thanks. Goodbye.}
{143}{}{Even those who appear the most innocent may deceive a messenger of the word...
 how do I know that you're a TRUE believer?}
{144}{}{You'll be a true believer when I shove my foot up your ass!}
{145}{}{I AM a true believer, brother. How can I prove my devotion?}
{146}{}{I know that this city has built its foundations on sin and slavery, and that only the righteous
 may set it right!}
{147}{}{You know, maybe we'll just talk later.}
{148}{}{Ignorant heathen! You have ears, but you do not listen! You have eyes,
 but you are blind! Get from my sight, filthy swine!}
{149}{}{Filthy... uh... sw... what? Nobody talks to me like that! Hope you ain't got no family that'll miss
 you, dead man...}
{150}{}{Nobody talks to me like that, least of all some two-bit wanna-be soapbox preacher. I think
 it's time you learned a lesson, dead man.}
{151}{}{Calm down. I'm leaving.}
{152}{}{Hmmmmmm. One must beware serpents that echo the words of truth, yet
 shelter falsehood within their heart.}
{153}{}{Amen, brother! }
{154}{}{If there is no trust between us, I shall leave. Goodbye.}
{155}{}{Uh... sure. Maybe we'll talk later.}
{156}{}{What?! How DARE you blackmail me, you... you... (Frowns.)... you have my full attention.}
{157}{}{Let's discuss payment, shall we?}
{158}{}{Why... where better to preach than to those that need to hear the most?}
{159}{}{I suppose you're right. Who are you?}
{160}{}{Testify, brother! Speak the word!}
{161}{}{Exactly! This city is built on sin and slavery and it needs the strength of the righteous to
 set it right!}
{162}{}{Uh... right. Well, good talking to you. Goodbye.}
{163}{}{Here... this briefcase has my
 account numbers in it. Deliver it to John Bishop in New Reno, and he will give you access to my
 accounts.}
{164}{}{Forget it. I'm turning you in anyway.}
{165}{}{Screw the payment, then. I'm not going to Reno.}
{166}{}{Great! But it better be worth my while.}
{167}{}{It seems nature has already punished you, slaver. Perhaps one day you shall redeem yourself.}
{168}{}{Eh... that's not it. Walk carefully in the wastes, my simple
 friend.}
{169}{}{Urf}
{170}{}{So, friend, have you reconsidered?}
{171}{}{I've considered that it might be worth a lot of money for me to keep your secret. Understand?}
{172}{}{I've seen the light, brother... what shall I do?}
{173}{}{No, sorry. Good day.}
{174}{}{Eh? What are you doing here? Didn't you deliver...}
{175}{}{... the case to Bishop? Well, I TRIED, except he read this little note you left in the case
 and tried to KILL me. Pretty funny, huh? Hope you're ready to die, Moore.}
{176}{}{I did, but I came back to fill you full of holes then cover your body with a thin layer of dirt.}
{177}{}{Just keeping you on your toes. Bye.}
{178}{}{Ah! Welcome again, fellow seeker of truth! How can I help you this day?}
{179}{}{What do you know about the NCR?}
{180}{}{I had a question: Why does Vault City have slaves? I heard it was a free city.}
{181}{}{I want to hear the word, brother!}
{182}{}{This city is built on sin and slavery and I have come to set it right!}
{183}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{184}{}{I know that they are striving to revive truth and justice, and we will not lift
 a hand to help.}
{185}{}{What can we do?}
{186}{}{That sounds a lot like treason.}
{187}{}{That's a shame. Oh well, goodbye.}
{188}{}{We can throw our gates wide and welcome them in! They need our help, yet
 STILL we turn a blind eye!}
{189}{}{Amen! Vault City's advanced technology should be shared, not hoarded.}
{190}{}{Hmm... I don't know. We have it pretty good here. Do we really need them? After all, they'd
 bring down our standard of living... contaminate us, even.}
{191}{}{Hmmm. Well, it's something to think about. Goodbye.}
{192}{}{I cannot answer that, for a city built on slavery can never be truly free.}
{193}{}{Yeah, but they can sure get rich, huh?}
{194}{}{Your words... they strike a chord with me. Perhaps freeing the slaves, welcoming them, is best
 for Vault City.}
{195}{}{We should free the slaves, and embrace them as brothers!}
{196}{}{Aw, don't give me that brahmin shit. Slavery... and Vault City... is gonna be around a long time.}
{197}{}{Interesting words. Perhaps we'll speak again.}
{198}{}{I see you are a trader in human flesh. I have NOTHING to say to one
 such as yourself.}
{199}{}{Uurmph}
{200}{}{Ecch}
{201}{}{Portzebie}
{202}{}{Shamble off}
{203}{}{Hey, I only acted like a slaver to get information.}
{204}{}{Well, I had something to say to you: Why does Vault City have slaves? I thought this was a
 free city.}
{205}{}{Hey, even the lowest means justify a noble end.}
{206}{}{All right then. Bye.}
{207}{}{It's good to see intolerance alive and well. Good day.}
{208}{}{The act is the same as the deed. Begone, slaver.}
{209}{}{But I've learned the error of my ways!}
{210}{}{That does it. Time to cut you open and see what you're made of...}
{211}{}{All right then.}
{212}{}{I have nothing to say to one of such foul disposition. Leave.}
{213}{}{You want foul disposition? I'll SHOW you foul disposition...}
{214}{}{I've seen the error of my ways. I've come to repent and hear the word!}
{215}{}{My heart was torn because of the thought of man's inhumanity to man!}
{216}{}{All right then. }
{217}{}{Hello again, fellow pilgrim! Did you deliver the information as I asked?}
{218}{}{Hello again, fellow pilgrim! How can I help you on this day?}
{219}{}{Let's cut the crap, "Tomcat." I know everything about you and your "friends" down in NCR.}
{220}{}{Why would you work for the NCR? I thought you were an honorable man.}
{221}{}{Yes... look, Bishop said you worked for NCR. Is that true?}
{222}{}{Yes, I just wanted to let you know I'd taken care of it.}
{223}{}{It pleases me to hear that my words have taken seed in your heart. Perhaps our paths
 will cross again.}
{224}{}{Perhaps so. Keep the faith, brother.}
{225}{}{Goodbye.}
{226}{}{The NCR is trying to bring honor and government to all of California,
 and Vault City has the power to make it happen! Think of the good we could do with access to Vault
 City's technology!}
{227}{}{I don't buy it. I think I should turn you in - unless, of course, you want to buy my silence.}
{228}{}{But it's Vault City's technology. Others have no right to it.}
{229}{}{Nothing good comes from lies and treachery, Moore. Vault City has been lying to itself for
 years... don't go down that road, all right?}
{230}{}{Hmm. I'll have to think about this.}
{231}{}{You're right. I'm sorry I doubted you.}
{232}{}{ALL men have the right to the fruits of the old world. Technology is to be shared, not
 hoarded.}
{233}{}{You just don't GET it, do you, Moore? Maybe a good old fashioned ass-kicking will knock some
 sense into you.}
{234}{}{Yeah, yeah, cut the "holier-than-thou" crap. Hand over some cash, or I'm
 turning you in.}
{235}{}{I'll have to think about that. Bye.}
{236}{}{Please deliver the case to New Reno, friend. Time is of the essence!}
{237}{}{What to do? Why, spread the word, and that shall be enough.
 Walk carefully and with purpose in the wastes, my friend. With the word as your light, you shall not
 go astray.}
{238}{}{Thank you, brother. I shall do as you have said.}
{239}{}{Have you heard the word today?}
{240}{}{Hear the word! The word shall set you free!}
{241}{}{Slavery shall damn this city!}
{242}{}{We must open the gates of Vault City and embrace the outside world!}
{243}{}{Why can we not share our wealth?! }
{244}{}{Can you not hear the cries of those that suffer outside our walls?!}
