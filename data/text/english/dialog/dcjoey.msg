{100}{}{You see a thug.}
{101}{}{You see Joey.}

{150}{}{This guy doesn't look too friendly.}
{151}{}{[TALK]}

# 1.
{152}{}{I'm gonna cut you up, fucker!}
{153}{}{Yeah? Come on and try.}
{154}{}{Hey, wait just one minute!}
{155}{}{I'd think twice if I were you.}

# 2.
{156}{}{What do you want? Why shouldn't I just kill you rather than listen
 to your bullshit after what you've done?}
{157}{}{I want to talk to you about a ghost that comes around here at night.}
{158}{}{Did you take a locket from the haunted house?}
{159}{}{Never mind. I'll just kick your ass instead.}
{160}{}{Nothing. Just passing through.}

# 3.
{161}{}{What the hell are you talking about?}
{162}{}{Did you steal a locket from that haunted house?}
{163}{}{Nothing. Never mind.}
{164}{}{Forget it. I'll kill you now and sort out the pieces later.}

# 4.
{165}{}{I-I don't know what you're talking about.}
{166}{}{Oh, I think you do! You stole a dead girl's locket, and now her spirit can't rest.}
{167}{}{Then I'll take it by force.}

# 5.
{168}{}{T-That's f-fucking crazy! Y-you must h-have been r-really fucked up on some of Tubby's shit. I-I n-never s-saw no g-ghost w-when I stayed t-there- just a bad trip, wasn't f-fucking real.}
{169}{}{Look, I'll buy it from you.}
{170}{}{Give it to me or you can join her.}
{171}{}{If you don't return it now, she'll come after you. And she can't
 be stopped.}

# 6.
{172}{}{Huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. T-That's for damn sure. You're gonna have to fork over some bucks for sure. You ain't gettin' this for free! $50 or beat it!}
{173}{}{Okay, here's the money.}
{174}{}{Take $20 and be happy I don't just take it from you.}
{175}{}{Nah, I changed my mind. See ya.}
{176}{}{Give it to me or I kill you for it.}

# 7.
{177}{}{Here. Now just leave me alone.}
{178}{}{Gladly.}
{179}{}{Don't let me catch you doing this again!}

# 8.
{180}{}{H-Hey! You don't have the money! Get the hell out of here!}
{181}{}{Oops. I'll come back.}
{182}{}{Then I guess I have to kill you.}

# 9.
{183}{}{Hey. How's it goin'?}
{184}{}{OK, and you?}
{185}{}{Not so good.}
{186}{}{Did you take a locket from that haunted house?}
{187}{}{What do you know about that ghost that comes around here at night?}

# 10.
{188}{}{Hey, man, I'm Joey. What're you doin' on my turf?}
{189}{}{Your turf? I don't think so.}
{190}{}{Maybe I'm looking for you.}
{191}{}{Just leaving. Bye.}
{192}{}{Looking for some information.}

# 11.
{193}{}{Hey, baby cakes. You looking for Joey? Here I am.}
{194}{}{No. Go away.}
{195}{}{Maybe. What are you offering me?}
{196}{}{I want some information.}
{197}{}{No, sorry. I have to go now.}

# 12.
{198}{}{Hey, I got some Jet. It's great stuff and brand new from Reno. Want some?}
{199}{}{No way!}
{200}{}{How much?}
{201}{}{No, I want information.}
{202}{}{I have to go. Bye.}

# 13.
{203}{}{How about you and I get it on?}
{204}{}{Okay.}
{205}{}{Not if you were the last nonmutated man on the planet.}
{206}{}{Er, no... I don't think so. I need something else.}

# 14.
{207}{}{You'll be coming back.}
{208}{}{Maybe.}
{209}{}{Don't count on it.}
{210}{}{Wait! Can I ask you something?}

# 15.
{211}{}{Nobody talks to me like that!}
{212}{}{I just did. You do anything more than talk?}
{213}{}{Whatever. Are you selling anything or just making small talk?}
{214}{}{My apologies. I'm actually looking around and don't know the area.}

# 16.
{215}{}{What do you want?}
{216}{}{I'm looking for a locket.}
{217}{}{I need to know more about that haunted house.}
{218}{}{What's the deal with the old church and those guards?}
{219}{}{Nothing you can provide.}
{220}{}{Have you heard of Vault 13?}
{221}{}{Um, never mind. See you around.}

# 17. The Church
{222}{}{Oh, you mean Tyler and his gang? They guard some shit that comes in from Vault City. Big fucking crates. Once in a while you see them get picked up by caravans heading to New Reno.}
{223}{}{Can I ask you more about them?}
{224}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{225}{}{OK, thanks. Bye.}

# 18.
{226}{}{What else you wanna know?}
{227}{}{Who's Tyler?}
{228}{}{Where's New Reno?}
{229}{}{So, what are they guarding?}
{230}{}{I want to ask you about something else.}
{231}{}{That's it. Bye.}

# 19 Who's Tyler?
{232}{}{Tyler's just some weasel who screwed all the rest of us out of a sweet deal with
 Metzger, but fuck that shit! I don't fucking care anymore. I could kick his fucking ass though.
 Lara and him still have some really bad blood. Something about Tyler and her brother.}
{233}{}{That could be useful. Can I ask you more about them?}
{234}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{235}{}{OK, thanks. Bye.}

# 20. New Reno?
{236}{}{New Reno is down to the south a long ways, then east some. There's a lot
 of action to be made there, but it's pretty fucking dangerous too. I might head back
 some day. Here, I can show you where it's at on that fancy screen thing of yours.}
{237}{}{I think I can find it now. Can I ask you more about them?}
{238}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{239}{}{OK, thanks. Bye.}

# 21. Contents?
{240}{}{Hell if I know.}
{241}{}{Interesting. Can I ask you more about them?}
{242}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{243}{}{OK, thanks. Bye.}

# 22.
{244}{}{For you, I will sell Jet for $500.}
{245}{}{No, thanks. Bye.}
{246}{}{No, thanks, but I would like to ask you something.}
{247}{}{That's too much!}
{248}{}{OK, I'll buy it.}

# 23.
{249}{}{If you don't have the money, come back when you can afford it. Don't let me see
 you buying from anyone else or I'll kick your fucking ass. I'm the only one with the pure
 uncut shit, shipped directly from New Reno. }
{250}{}{Wait, I'll buy it.}
{251}{}{Well, can I ask you something?}
{252}{}{Bye.}

# 24.
{253}{}{OK, I'll drop the price to $350, but no less! That's my final offer. You got to pay
 top dollar for the good shit. Don't buy from Tubby or any of those losers. They cut their
 shit. I'm the only one for miles that can get a hold of the best stuff.}
{254}{}{Forget it. Can I ask you something?}
{255}{}{OK, I'll buy it.}
{256}{}{Never mind. Bye.}

# 25
{257}{}{Vault... Vault... Vault 13? Nope, never heard of it. Don't tell me they've come up
 with another new drug! Nothing can beat Jet!}
{258}{}{No, you moron.}
{259}{}{No, it's a place. Can I ask something else?}
{260}{}{Yes, a wonderful drug.}
{261}{}{No, bye.}

# ??Don't know what this is for.
{262}{}{Joey here isn't much of a conversationalist.}

# 4. extra
{300}{}{Probably not. Bye.}

# Addition for Node 17
{350}{}{You been sleeping? Turns out that Lara's a mean little bitch after all. She gunned Tyler down. I hear Metzger was in on it. Well, I better get back to... work.}
{351}{}{You been sleeping? Turns out that Lara was a mean little bitch after all- too bad she's dead. Whipped out Tyler's group. Her gang's running things over there now, last I heard.}
