{100}{}{You see a Khan raider.}
{101}{}{You see Phil, a Khan guard.}
{102}{}{You see a tough-looking young man in metal armor. He is heavily armed.}
{103}{}{I should shoot you dead, but I'm kind of curious about what you could possibly have to say to
 me.}
{104}{}{Me look for spy. Go this way.}
{105}{}{Me look for missing girl. You know where find?}
{106}{}{Me come here accident. Go now.}
{107}{}{Screw you. Me shoot you dead.}
{108}{}{Uh, we talk this out?}
{109}{}{I'm looking for an eavesdropper who came this way.}
{110}{}{I'm looking for a missing girl. Seen her?}
{111}{}{Sorry, took the wrong trail by accident. Gotta go.}
{112}{}{Up yours and have a bullet breakfast, asshole.}
{113}{}{I think we can talk this out like two civilized beings.}
{114}{}{Ah, that would be me. Now that you've found me, what's next?}
{115}{}{Why you spy Rebecca?}
{116}{}{Now me know not be shooting wrong person. Thanks!}
{117}{}{Nothing, me go now.}
{118}{}{Why are you spying on Rebecca?}
{119}{}{Just wanted to make sure I'm shooting the right person. Thanks, and have a nice day!}
{120}{}{Hmm. Nothing, I guess I'll be going now.}
{121}{}{I can't believe that you think you can just waltz in here and get answers to your questions!
 Oh, what the hell, you're about to die anyway and I feel generous. We've got her kid locked in the
 back room and have been having some fun with her. That bitch, Rebecca, has been trying to find her, so
 we've been keeping an eye open to make sure she doesn't get too close.}
{122}{}{You sicky in head. Me fix by remove head.}
{123}{}{What you mean have fun with girl?}
{124}{}{Oh, that explain. Me leave now.}
{125}{}{You are one sick puppy. I think I'll put you to sleep now.}
{126}{}{Fine, have fun and I'll be going now.}
{127}{}{Hand over the girl and we can all leave here alive.}
{128}{}{Think about it as you die, stupid.}
{129}{}{}
{130}{}{}
{131}{}{Why in the hell should I do that?}
{132}{}{It's good for your eternal soul.}
{133}{}{Because I'm the worst thing that you could ever fear happening to you. Hand her over or feel
 the pain.}
{134}{}{Because if we fight, one of us will die. I don't want to die any more than you do, so let's end
 this peacefully. Okay?}
{135}{}{Screw that noise.}
{136}{}{}
{137}{}{}
{138}{}{That sounds like a challenge. I'll take it.}
{139}{}{}
{140}{}{}
{141}{}{Hmm... I... Yeah, Okay. Here's the key to her cell; she's in the back room of the shack. Take her
 and get out, but don't come back. If I see you again, we'll see who lives and who dies.}
{142}{}{Let's see who comes out of this alive.}
{143}{}{Thanks, you did the right thing.}
{144}{}{The only way you're leaving here is feet first, in a box.}
{145}{}{}
{146}{}{}
{147}{}{You mean the one locked up in back that we've been having fun with? No, I haven't seen her.}
{148}{}{You sicky in head. Me fix by remove head.}
{149}{}{What you mean have fun with girl?}
{150}{}{Oh. Me leave now.}
{151}{}{You are one sick puppy. I think I'll put you to sleep now.}
{152}{}{Fine, have fun and I'll be going now.}
{153}{}{Hand over the girl and we can all leave here alive.}

{154}{}{So, you've returned. Let's see who comes out on top.}
{155}{}{We killed that bitch Chrissy, and now it's your turn to die!}
