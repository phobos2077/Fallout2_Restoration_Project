{100}{}{You see a very stiff woman. She looks like she hasn't relaxed in years.}
{101}{}{You see Melinda, the Chief Greeting Officer.}
{102}{}{Hello. I don't think I've seen you around before. Welcome to Vault
 City. Is there anything I can help you with?}
{103}{}{Yes, what else can I help you with?}
{104}{}{Is this fenced-in area the city?}
{105}{}{I'm looking for the Vault.}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{No thanks. Goodbye.}
{108}{}{Thizz Valt Citeee?}
{109}{}{No, no... don't let the surroundings confuse you. You're
 currently standing in the Courtyard. The actual city lies to the North.}
{110}{}{What's the difference between the two areas?}
{111}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{112}{}{Thanks for your help. Goodbye.}
{113}{}{Thankee}
{114}{}{Our Vault? It is located within the city. However, I must tell you only
 Citizens are allowed in the Vault.}
{115}{}{I need to get into the Vault.}
{116}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{117}{}{Thanks for your help. Goodbye.}
{118}{}{My name? Why, it's Melinda. I'm the Chief Greeting Officer for Vault City.}
{119}{}{Sounds like a tough job.}
{120}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{121}{}{Thanks for your help.}
{122}{}{The Courtyard is an area where we protect the less fortunate Outworlders. Many
 live within our protection and add to the splendor of Vault City. The Inner City is
 where the Citizens of the city live.}
{123}{}{Why do only Citizens live in the Inner City?}
{124}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{125}{}{Thank you for your help.}
{126}{}{I'm sorry, but as I said, only Citizens are allowed in the Vault. I cannot
 grant you access. Talk to Wallace, our Customs Official. He might be able to help.
 You'll find his office at the north end of the Courtyard.}
{127}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{128}{}{Thanks for your help. Goodbye.}
{129}{}{My work benefits Vault City, and I have the privilege of being able to talk
 to travelers about the grandeur of the city.}
{130}{}{Oh, come on, it has to be a *little* boring sometimes.}
{131}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{132}{}{Thank you for your help.}
{133}{}{To build a better life for everyone, we must be vigilant in protecting ourselves
 from outside influences.}
{134}{}{And that means separating yourselves?}
{135}{}{I take great pride in the work that I do for Vault City. You'll have
 to excuse me, but I have some very pressing business to attend to. Good day.}
{136}{}{We don't do it for *ourselves.* We do it for the betterment of everyone.}
{137}{}{Yeah, sure you do. It sounds better that way.}
{138}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{139}{}{Thanks for your help.}
{140}{}{You don't seem capable of understanding what we're doing here.}
{141}{}{You're right. I can't understand it because it doesn't make any *sense.*}
{142}{}{I was just curious. Thanks for your help.}
{143}{}{I am very busy at the moment. Speak to the Sub-Greeting Officer if you
 require assistance.}
