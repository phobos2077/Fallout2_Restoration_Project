{100}{}{You see one of two very similar looking men -- they could be twins.
 Both are heavily muscled and have beetling brows.}
{101}{}{You see either Chuck or Buck Dunton, they both look so much alike that you're not sure which one you're looking at right now.}
{102}{}{You see a tall, heavily muscled man whose face, beneath his beetling brow, is habitually
 twisted into a bully's smirking scowl. He looks just like his brother.}

{110}{}{You just better push off, or my brother and I are going to pound your little head into jam.}
{111}{}{Hey, take it easy. I was just kidding around. I'm really sorry. Don't hit me, please.
 Besides, I wanted to ask you two about something.}
{112}{}{Uh, sorry, Mr. Dunton, sir. I'll be leaving now.}
{113}{}{I need some information, and you just better tell me what I need to know.}
{114}{}{You and your brother? Are you afraid to take me on all alone? (Cluck, cluck, cluck)}

{120}{}{Just get out before we smash you flat and turn you into drymeat.}
{121}{}{Hey, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I'm just stupid. I'll come back later when
 you're not so sick of looking at me.}
{122}{}{Oh, okay, sorry. Don't hit me. Please.}
{123}{}{At least I won't have to look at your butt-ugly faces anymore.}

{130}{}{What do you want to know from us?}
{131}{}{I don't think we need to tell you anything. What the heck do you want, anyway?}
{132}{}{So, what's the little wimp want from us, anyway?}
{133}{}{Either of you ever hear about something called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{134}{}{I'd like to barter.}
{135}{}{Any work around here?}
{136}{}{Uh, just which Dunton are you, anyway?}
{137}{}{Have you heard anything about brahmin mutilations around here?}
{138}{}{I guess I don't need anything after all. Goodbye.}

{140}{}{You went way over the line. I think you just better get out of here before we teach you a lesson.}
{141}{}{I'm sorry, I just got so excited working with you two. I'll leave now. Goodbye.}
{142}{}{Line? What line? It was your idea in the first place.}
{143}{}{You two are just too yellow to do what needed to be done.}

{150}{}{Well, we have a good supply of our world famous Dunton's Drymeat on hand. Tasty and delicious -
 good for you, too.}
{151}{}{Uh, that's great. }
{152}{}{Drymeat? That doesn't sound like what I need. Tell me something else.}
{153}{}{I don't think I need to barter after all. Goodbye.}

{160}{}{You had your chance, pal.}
{161}{}{I don't think there's any work for you here.}
{162}{}{Well, there is one thing that we could use some help with. (Heh, heh, heh)}
{163}{}{What's that Chuck?}
{164}{}{What's that Buck?}
{165}{}{Uh, what's that?}
{166}{}{Oh, yeah. Well, tell me something else then.}
{167}{}{Hey, wait - I really do want to help you guys out. Tell me about that job again.}
{168}{}{Well, I guess I missed out. I'll be going then. Goodbye.}
{169}{}{Okay. Bye.}

{170}{}{You worthless sack of gecko shit! Just what the hell are doing in our sight again?}
{171}{}{I just wanted to apologize. I didn't mean to screw up. I'm just not as good at rustling as you
 two. Besides, I need something from you.}
{172}{}{Well, you're right - I could have done a better job. I guess I'm not a natural rustler like
 you two are. I need something, though.}
{173}{}{Gecko shit? Are we talking about what you eat, or what you use for brains?}

{180}{}{Back again, huh? Well, what can we help you with, business partner?}
{181}{}{Hey there, pal. That sure was a sweet job we pulled on that dumb-ass Torr, huh? Let me get your
 cut of the action.}
{182}{}{That was a sweet deal. Let me know when you've got another job like that one lined up. I need
 something else right now, though. }
{183}{}{I'm here for my cut, partners.}
{184}{}{What we did made me ashamed of myself. Cheating an idiot? Why don't you cowards take on someone
 who can defend themselves for a change? Goodbye.}
{185}{}{I guess I don't really need anything right now. Goodbye.}

{190}{}{OK - here's the $50 and a little something extra for you, as well. A few sticks of Dunton's
 Drymeat. Thanks again, partner.}
{191}{}{Thanks. Hey, there's something else that I want to know.}
{192}{}{I can sure use that money. Mmm, (bite) tasty jerky, too. Thanks. Goodbye.}

{198}{}{OK, here's the deal. We need some help in, uh, liberating some brahmin from that idiot Torr. You shouldn't have trouble with that. Just talk him out of them. What do you say?}
{199}{}{Now I remember. Thanks. }
{200}{}{Meet us at the brahmin grazing area, just to the east of town, at 6:00 PM tonight.}
{201}{}{Meet us at the brahmin grazing area, just to the east of town, at 6:00 PM tomorrow night.}
{202}{}{OK, I'll take care of Torr. }
{203}{}{OK, I'll find Torr at the grazing area and take care of him for you. }
{204}{}{I don't think I want to do that after all.}
{205}{}{OK, I'll be there. Goodbye.}
{206}{}{In the meantime, though, there's something that I want to know.}
{207}{}{Goodbye.}

{208}{}{I'm Chuck Dunton. What are you? Dumb?}
{209}{}{I'm Buck Dunton. What are you? Dumb?}
{210}{}{Do I look especially ugly? I'm Chuck Dunton.}
{211}{}{Do I look especially ugly? I'm Buck Dunton.}
{212}{}{Are you slow in the head? I'm Chuck Dunton.}
{213}{}{Are you slow in the head? I'm Buck Dunton.}
{214}{}{You just can't get it straight. Damn simpleton tribals. I'm Chuck, you dumb-ass.}
{215}{}{You just can't get it straight. Damn simpleton tribals. I'm Buck, you dumb-ass.}
{216}{}{I'm Big Nose Sally Dunton. Do you like my dress? I'm Chuck Dunton, you stupid tribal.}
{217}{}{I'm Big Nose Sally Dunton. Do you like my dress? I'm Buck Dunton, you stupid tribal.}
{218}{}{Uh, okay. Yeah, I thought so. Sorry.}
{219}{}{Don't worry. I have it now. I need something from you, uh, Mr. Dunton.}
{220}{}{Yeah, whoever. Look, just tell me what I need to know.}
{221}{}{Well, you're both so damn stupid and ugly. Besides, I don't give a flying fuck which Dunton
 I'm yelling at. Goodbye, asshole.}
{222}{}{Uh, yeah. Well, tell me about the job.}

{230}{}{Word to the wise - you just better not say nuthin' to nobody. 'Cause if'n you do, that would
 make us very angry. You don't want to see us angry.}
{231}{}{Sorry, I won't tell anyone. I promise, Mr. Dunton, sir. Goodbye.}
{232}{}{Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. Now tell me something else.}
{233}{}{Don't want to see you angry? I don't want to see your ugly mugs at all. Goodbye.}

{240}{}{Well, it's a pleasure doing business with you. Heh, heh, heh. Need anything else?}
{241}{}{Hmm... I think I forgot to barter for something.}
{242}{}{Yes, I do.}
{243}{}{No, I think that's it for now, Chuck.}
{244}{}{No, I think that's it for now, Buck.}

{250}{}{Hey there, partner. Still counting on you for tonight. What can I do for you?}
{251}{}{Uh, I've reconsidered. I don't think I want to help you tonight.}
{252}{}{Yup. I'll be there. Let me ask you something, though.}
{253}{}{Sure I will. Goodbye.}

{259}{}{Well, if it isn't our burly-armed chum.}
{260}{}{Hey there. How's your arm coming? Ready to go again?}
{261}{}{Hey there, you little squirt. What are you doing in our bar? You have to prove yourself to the
 Duntons by arm-wrestling me before we'll let you stay. (ha ha ha)}
{262}{}{You don't look so darn tough. Why don't you arm-wrestle me, Chuck Dunton, for the right to drink
 in our bar?}
{263}{}{You don't look so darn tough. Why don't you arm-wrestle me, Buck Dunton, for the right to drink
 in our bar?}
{264}{}{Hey there, goody-two-shoes. You've gotta earn your admittance to our bar. You've gotta
 arm-wrestle me, Chuck Dunton.}
{265}{}{Hey there, goody-two-shoes. You've gotta earn your admittance to our bar. You've gotta
 arm-wrestle me, Buck Dunton.}

{266}{}{Hey, looks like we've got ourselves a contender here. You've gotta arm-wrestle me, Chuck Dunton,
 if you want to drink in here.}
{267}{}{Hey, looks like we've got ourselves a contender here. You've gotta arm-wrestle me, Buck Dunton,
 if you want to drink in here.}

{268}{}{Let's arm-wrestle. I guess that's the only way I'll get some peace in here.}
{269}{}{I don't think I want to arm-wrestle you right now.}
{270}{}{I don't want to wrestle right now. All I want is some information.}
{271}{}{Uh, I think I'm in the wrong bar. Goodbye.}

{280}{}{You won this time. Well, aren't you a tricky little cuss? Quick as a gecko with its tail set
 on fire. Well, the first drink's on me.}
{281}{}{Thanks. Maybe you can tell me something I want to know.}
{282}{}{I just got lucky this time. Thanks.}
{283}{}{I don't really need your beer, thanks. Let me ask you something, though.}
{284}{}{I don't think I want your beer. Goodbye.}

{290}{}{You're lucky I didn't snap your little arm like a dried twig. (Hyuk, hyk, hyuk) Well, I guess
 there's still no challenge here in town.}
{291}{}{Haven't you had enough abuse for one evening?}
{292}{}{I want to take you on again. I'll show you this time.}
{293}{}{Ouch. okay, okay, I've had enough. Hey, let me ask you something.}
{294}{}{That's it for me. Goodbye.}

{300}{}{Don't want to arm wrestle us? What, you think you're too good to arm-wrestle against one of the
 Dunton brothers?}
{301}{}{I think you'd hurt me if I arm-wrestled you.}
{302}{}{Maybe later. Right now, I need some information.}
{303}{}{It wouldn't even be a contest. I'd win. Goodbye.}
{304}{}{You look too wimpy. I only arm-wrestle real men. Take off, you hoser.}

{310}{}{You're looking for a what? Close as I ever get to the Garden of Eden is in lovely Jenny's arms
 over at Ma's bathhouse. (hyuk, hyuk, hyuk)}
{311}{}{Uh, thanks. Let me ask you something else, then.}
{312}{}{I guess that's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{320}{}{Well, I hear that they're some (hyuk, hyuk) bug-men cutting up brahmin out east of us. But I
 wouldn't believe everything you hear. (hyuk, hyuk, hyuk).}
{321}{}{Oh, I see; thanks. There's something else I wanted to know about.}
{322}{}{I guess that's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}

{330}{}{Hello there. You here to barter for some of our World Famous Dunton's Drymeat?}
{331}{}{Well? You here to buy some drymeat or what?}
{332}{}{That sounds great. I'd like to barter.}
{333}{}{Drymeat? That sounds interesting. Tell me more about that.}
{334}{}{Actually, I had some questions for you.}
{335}{}{I don't think I need anything right now thanks. Goodbye.}
{336}{}{I was curious about all those brahmin you have out back. They don't all seem to have the same
 brand on them.}

{340}{}{Huh? What the hell do you mean? They're all ours.}
{341}{}{What I mean is that some of them look as though they have a different brand that someone's
 clumsily branded over.}
{342}{}{Oh, I see. Heh-heh, I must have made a mistake. I'll be going now. Goodbye.}
{343}{}{Well, I guess I just don't know much about brahmin. Must be their coloration or something.
 Fine-looking brahmin you have here.}

{350}{}{Well, our drymeat is an incredible blend of eleven herbs and spices. Let me tell you, it's
 finger-lickin' good. Animals love it, too. They'll chase you from all over to get some. Must be that
 rotting smell.}
{351}{}{There's nothing else like it. Anywhere. It's you-neek. And most people are happy it's like that.}
{352}{}{It's PEOPLE! Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk, just wanted to see your face when I said that. Heck, it's only
 part people. Hyuk, hyuk.}
{353}{}{It's not like anything that most people would eat. It's different. Not better, just
 different.}
{354}{}{No cruelty to animals involved here. This is all found meat. Sometimes it takes us a while to
 find it, but usually we can home in on the stink.}
{355}{}{After a long day in the brahmin pen, we get some choice boot scrapings to flavor it with.}
{356}{}{Well, we've found that a sauce made by us personally, if ya' know what I mean, gives it that
 down-home taste. }
{357}{}{It's made from beef aged over six months and tenderized by the choicest horsefly maggots.}
{358}{}{Incredible. It sounds as though you actually eat your own drymeat. Uh, what I mean to say is,
 who wouldn't? Yum-yum.}
{359}{}{Really? That's fascinating. Tell me more.}
{360}{}{I think that's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{361}{}{If I were starving to death, I'd rather hack off my own arm and eat it than your damn
 drymeat.}

{370}{}{You here because you changed your mind? You want to help save those poor little brahmin from
 Torr?}
{371}{}{What the heck are you doing here? You here to help us or not? We might have a job for you
 if you're interested.}
{372}{}{Yeah, I'm interested. Tell me about this job.}
{373}{}{I don't think I want anything to do with you two. Goodbye.}
{374}{}{I found a pile of bug parts in that house over there. Do you know what they are?}

{380}{}{What the heck do you want? Did you forget what you're supposed to be doing?}
{381}{}{No. I remember. I'll get busy with our plan.}
{382}{}{Are you crazy? They're on to us. I'm here to warn you not to go through with it. I bet they're
 watching us right now.}
{383}{}{I forgot; would you go over the plan again for me? Please.}
{384}{}{I found a pile of bug parts in that house over there. Do you know what they are?}

{390}{}{Bug parts? Umm, err, ah, we don't know nuthin' about no bug parts. What are you talking about?}
{391}{}{Well, I found a pile of bug parts that had straps and buckles so that they looked as though they
 could be worn as a costume. I found them lying on the floor.}
{392}{}{Uh, just forget it. Goodbye.}

{400}{}{Here's what's happening. You need to get Torr.}
{401}{}{Sounds good, I'll do it.}
{402}{}{Not a chance; I'm outa here, Dunton. Goodbye.}
{403}{}{Are you crazy? They're on to us. I'm here to warn you not to go through with it. I bet they're
 watching us right now.}
{404}{}{When Torr shows up, we need you to get him}
{405}{}{ out of here for a while. You can talk to him or knock him unconscious. But don't kill him or
 you'll get people all riled up. While you do that, we'll get the brahmin. Meet us back at our shop
 tomorrow to pick up your reward.}

{410}{}{Maybe you're right. (looking around quickly) I don't like the idea of someone watching me.}
{411}{}{You should be kinder to others of your own kind. Now go home.}

{420}{}{Nobody's watching us. We're real careful about that. You're just yellow, aren't you? Frigging
 coward. }
{421}{}{Sorry, I guess I was just getting nervous. I'm not as cool under pressure as you two are.}
{422}{}{Sorry, I panicked. I'll get back to work, then.}
{423}{}{Not a chance. I'm leaving. Goodbye.}
{424}{}{Now get back to your job and get rid of that idiot Torr!}

{430}{}{You're crazy. Those are just left over from some radscorpions we killed. Yeah, that's it.
 That's the ticket. We, uh, umm, use their venom as one of the secret ingredients in our drymeat recipe.}
{431}{}{Yeah, sure. I'll believe that as soon as the sun rises in the west.}
{432}{}{Well, if you say so. That's good enough for me. Goodbye.}

{440}{}{You just better keep your mouth shut if you know what's good for you.}
{441}{}{Geez, take it easy. I was just going to tell you what a great idea I thought it was. Sheesh,
 calm down.}
{442}{}{Sorry. I will. Goodbye.}
{443}{}{Yeah, well, I'm taking off. Goodbye.}
{444}{}{I got a better idea. How about you shut YOUR mouth for a change. I'm tired of hearing you flap your
 rotten gums.}

{449}{}{Hello there, tribal. }
{450}{}{I'm Chuck Dunton.}
{451}{}{I'm Buck Dunton.}
{452}{}{Oooogly man.}
{453}{}{ Chosen one!}

{460}{}{Ooogly ann? Huh? You're just as dumb as that idiot Torr. That's good, we need a new fricking
 village idiot in town. We've just about used that Torr up.}
{461}{}{Torr up?}

{470}{}{Chosen one, huh? Chosen most likely to be punched in the mouth. Did your momma drop you on the
 head, or did you just come out that dumb and ugly? Get the hell away from me.}
{471}{}{Ook! }
{472}{}{ Chosen one!}

{480}{}{You ready to go? Well, come on then. We don't have all damn night. We've got work to do.}
{481}{}{Uh, yeah; I'm ready. Let's go.}
{482}{}{I'm ready to teach that idiot herdboy a lesson.}
{483}{}{I don't think I want to do this. See you later. }

{490}{}{Hey, just wait until we get inside; then we can talk.}
{500}{}{You struggle, but eventually the Dunton brother wins.}
{510}{}{You manage to beat the Dunton brother after a tough struggle.}
{520}{}{Ok.}

{530}{}{Get the hell out of here. Some of us gots work to do.}
{531}{}{Oh, OK. I guess I'll be moving on then. Sheesh, some people are so touchy. Goodbye.}
{532}{}{Torr grazes his Brahmin just north of Downtown here.}
{533}{}{When that Dumb-ass Torr gets here, you just better get rid of him.}

{600}{}{Even idiot Torr has got more brains than you, thief!}
{601}{}{ Ready to go?}

{700}{}{You have rustled the brahmin successfully.}

{702}{}{No, I'll tell you what you have these for. You dress up as "Bug Men" and scare poor old Torr out of his Brahmin, don't you -- don't you?! It all makes sense now. You're just a couple of no good ruffians.}
{703}{}{[The Dunton brothers' eyes get really wide and the two men begin to fidget uncomfortably.] Yy..yyy... yeah so... what's it to you, tribal? Everyone needs a little extra cash now and then. What's it to you anyway? What are you gonna do about it, huh?}
{704}{}{I'll tell you what. If you stop stealing brahmin and bothering Torr, then I won't turn you in. All I need is your word, since if it happens again, there won't be any of you left to steal another brahmin. Got it?!}
{705}{}{[hyuk, hyuk, hyuk] Yeah right, tribal. I think it's about time we teach you what happens to nosy tribals 'round here.}
{706}{}{Alright Tribal, you win this time. We'll stop, now just leave us alone.}
{707}{}{You scare the Dunton brothers into never bothering Torr again.}
{708}{}{[DONE]}
{709}{}{Just leave us alone.}
{710}{}{Yeah, whatever tribal. Just mind your own business.}

{800}{}{I found a pile of bug parts in the cabin over at the grazing area. Do you know what they are?}
