{102}{}{You see a dusty, sleepy-looking man. His clothes look very, VERY old fashioned.}
{103}{}{::he rubs sleep from his eyes:: Wha'... huh? Where am I? How long have I been asleep?}
{104}{}{Urr?}
{105}{}{Who are you?}
{106}{}{I have no idea how long you've been asleep, but you're in Broken Hills, near the New California Republic.}
{107}{}{Oh no! I've slept so long the world has turned stupid! Aieeeeeeee! ::he flees in panic::}
{108}{}{[DONE]}
{109}{}{I'm Chuck Stodgers, the greatest aero plane pilot in the world! Unfortunately... I crashed. I staggered into this cave to get away from the explosion, and the fumes overwhelmed me.}
{110}{}{That sounds suspiciously like the premise of a pulp cartoon series.}
{111}{}{New WHAT? CALIFORNIA? THE WORLD HAS CHANGED THAT MUCH? AIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! ::he flees in panic::}
{112}{}{Hey, now, wait a second...}

{115}{}{You've uncovered yet another obscure pop culture reference.}
{116}{}{Zzzzzzzzzzz.}
