{100}{}{You see an old console.}
{101}{}{It appears that this console manages the torpedo launching and loading system. Like everything else on the sub,
 it's rusted through and just barely working.}

{200}{}{This subsystem, if disabled, should prevent the tubes from being reloaded with spare torpedoes. Disabling
 shouldn't be too hard - the metal is literally falling apart and you can clearly see the vacuum tubes.}

{210}{}{Just like you thought - the metal gives way easily and the console is soon dismantled. This sub won't be able
 to reload its tubes anytime soon.}
{211}{}{You fail to disable the system.}
