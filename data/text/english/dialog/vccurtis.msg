{100}{}{You see Curtis.}
{101}{}{You see a small brown-haired boy. He looks like he has been crying.}
{102}{}{You see Curtis.}
{103}{}{You see a small brown-haired boy. He looks like he has been crying.}
{104}{}{You see a small brown-haired boy. He looks much happier than before.}
{105}{}{You see Curtis.}
{106}{}{You see a small brown-haired boy. He looks much happier than before.}
{107}{}{*Snfffff*}
{108}{}{Would you like some tea, Mr. Nixon?}
{109}{}{"Why yes I would, Curtis."}
{110}{}{Here you go. Drink up!}
{111}{}{"Thank you, Curtis."}
{112}{}{Thank YOU, Mr. Nixon.}
{113}{}{"Do you want to go dig up Daddy's wrench?"}
{114}{}{No, Mr. Nixon. Daddy will be mad we buried it.}
{115}{}{"But it's buried under those rocks just behind the bar. We could get it right now."}
{116}{}{No, Daddy'll be mad. It's best to lie, just like you told me, Mr. Nixon.}
{117}{}{I lost my friend while playing in the Courtyard. His name is Mr. Nixon.}
{118}{}{Mr. Nixon has a blue shirt and a big nose. He's really, really short.}
{119}{}{Have you seen Mr. Nixon? I lost him.}
{120}{}{Thanks for finding Mr. Nixon. He says thanks, too.}
{121}{}{Yer mutant is scary.}
{122}{}{Yer ghoul is scary.}
{123}{}{Yer metal doggie looks like he wants to eat me.}
{124}{}{I lost Mr. Nixon. I don't know where I left him.}
{125}{}{Thizzz Nixxson?}
{126}{}{Shamble off}
{127}{}{This him? He was looking around for you, too.}
{128}{}{I have Mr. Nixon right here. But you know what? I think Mr. Nixon should be punished for going off on his own. Some ritual dismemberment may be in order. So, first I'm going to pull off his arms, then...}
{129}{}{Neither do I.}
{130}{}{You found him! You found Mr. Nixon!}
{131}{}{Byeee Mistuh Nixxson}
{132}{}{Sure I did. He didn't go far. Now keep an eye on him from now on, okay?}
{133}{}{NO! NOOOOO! Don't! Stop it! Sto--}
{134}{}{Ooops. Looks like Nixon was a little more fragile than I thought. Too bad, kid.}
{135}{}{Mr. Nixon will come back from the grave and KILL you.}
{136}{}{Mr. Nixon will haunt you for the rest of your days. I mean it.}
{137}{}{When I grow up, you'll be old, and I'll do to you what you did to Mr. Nixon.}
{138}{}{You returned Mr. Nixon to Curtis.}
{139}{}{You taught Curtis that life is cruel and unfair.}
