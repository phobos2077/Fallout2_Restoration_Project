{100}{}{You see a Tough Guard.}
{101}{}{You see an impressively muscled, but aging guard with sun burnt skin. He must have been quite something in his
 prime. His piercing gaze seems to follow you everywhere.}

{200}{}{Hi there, traveler. Welcome to the Abbey. Keep your nose clean and we'll get along just fine.}
{201}{}{I'm watching you, slaver. One wrong move and you'll be tainting our graveyard for the rest of eternity.
 I wouldn't wish that on you, and I'm fairly sure you wouldn't enjoy that either, so don't get any funny ideas in that
 warped brain of yours.}
{202}{}{Who are you?}
{203}{}{Where can I barter for some supplies?}
{204}{}{Somebody is digging up graves, why don't you do anything about it?}
{205}{}{I heard something about animals in the basement. Know anything about that?}
{206}{}{I think it's time I send you to a grave. Let's dance, old man.}
{207}{}{Nevermind. Goodbye.}

{300}{}{Nobody... Just an old retired caravan guard. A lot of people mistake me for some sort of sheriff because I'm
 the closest thing resembling the law in these parts, but I'm not. I just look out for this community because I think
 it's worth protecting.}
{301}{}{And in return the community looks out for me. I get some complimentary booze from the monks, Peterson makes
 sure I'm fed and Bill makes sure I've got ammo and stims. Not a bad retirement gig, if you ask me.}
{302}{}{I'm the one keeping you in line, and that's all you need to know. Now get on with your business and leave me
 alone.}
{303}{}{That is a nice arrangement. Let me ask you something else.}
{304}{}{Whatever, goodbye.}
{305}{}{You think you can keep me in line? Let's see you try it, old man. This should be fun.}

{400}{}{You can find Bill, our resident trader, in the building across from here. Other than that, you ought to go
 to Percy's Survival Gear Locker at the Junkyard in Gecko or Happy Harry's in the Courtyard at Vault City.}
{401}{}{Good to know. I have another question.}
{402}{}{Thanks, bye.}

{500}{}{If someone is poor or greedy enough to try and dig up graves, that's their business. It's not like the dead can
 use what they're buried with anyway. Not my problem... I'm not losing any sleep over it.}
{501}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{502}{}{Bye.}
 
{600}{}{Yes, and Brother Thomas is missing. He was a smart man, but a bit foolhardy. I don't know what's down there,
 but I don't think it's just a bunch of rats and radscorpies.}
{601}{}{Yes, and Brother Thomas is missing. I don't know what's down there, but I don't think it's just a bunch of rats
 and radscorpies. Why don't you find out, tough guy?}
{602}{}{So why don't you go look?}
{603}{}{You're the tough guy around here, aren't you? Why don't you drag your ass down there?}

{610}{}{It's a bit embarrassing, but after spending so much time outdoors with the caravans, I get very nervous when I
 go underground. The walls just close in on me and I have trouble breathing... Maybe you can find out what happened to
 Brother Thomas?}
{611}{}{I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, let me ask you something else.}
{612}{}{Bye.}
{613}{}{I am a tough guy, which is why I'm gonna kick your ass.}

{700}{}{What else do you want to know?}

{800}{}{It's good to see you again.}
{801}{}{I'm keeping my eye on you.}
