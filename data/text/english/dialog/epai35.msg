{100}{}{You see a computer.}
{101}{}{You see the EPA's museum computer.}

{200}{}{Welcome to the EPA's museum! This terminal will project a movie using exciting new holographic technology!
 The movie is an entertaining and informational look at the scary, but possible, reality of a post-nuclear world.}
{201}{}{[Play movie.]}
{202}{}{[Logoff.]}

{210}{}{[The terminal projects a hologram of a tall bespectacled man in a lab coat. He waves and gives you a friendly smile.]
 Hello, I'm Dr. Caleb, and I'll be hosting this holographic video on a post-holocaust America.}
{211}{}{[MORE]}

{220}{}{[A living room materializes around Dr. Caleb, where a family appears to be relaxing for the evening. Dr. Caleb
 pats the head of the family dog, then smiles at you.] Meet the Johnsons. They're your average American family. Dad smokes
 his pipe, Mom reads her cook book, and little Billy and Susie catch some boob-tube before bedtime. They think everything
 will be just fine. They ignore the warning sirens, thinking that it's just another drill. Oh, but what's this?}
{221}{}{[MORE]}

{230}{}{[Through the back window, you see a large bomb crash to the earth, creating a massive mushroom cloud explosion,
 followed by a blinding light. Once the light fades away, you see Dr. Caleb is now standing in the burnt ruins of the
 living room, with the family replaced by skeletons.] Uh-oh! It looks like the commies dropped the big one, and the
 Johnsons weren't quite as safe as they thought. Now, what can we learn from the Johnson family's mistake?}
{231}{}{[MORE]}

{240}{}{That's right! In the event of a nuclear war, you want your family to be safe within the shelter of a Vault-Tec
 brand vault. Vault-Tec have constructed 122 public vaults around our great nation, so there's bound to be one near you.
 As you can imagine, space is very limited, so reserve your space today, or else *your* family might end up like the
 Johnsons here. [Dr. Caleb pats the head of the skeletal dog. The skull detaches from the body and hits the floor,
 shattering. A Mr. Handy robot hovers over and sweeps up the skull fragments.]}
{241}{}{[MORE]}

{250}{}{It looks like Mr. Handy's going to have his work cut out for him if he plans to clean up *this* mess. [Dr. Caleb
 laughs as the image fades away and is replaced by text.] Thank you for watching. This educational video was brought to
 you by the fine folks at Vault-Tec. Vault-Tec, America's Final Word in Homes.}
