#killap - expansion
{410}{}{Well fuck me sideways, look who came by. The good samaritan who "saved the children" decided to grace me with his presence.
 You know, I'm a good Samurai-itan guy myself -- providin' fer them little paisanos and all. That is, until you came along and made that
 fuckin' orphanage idea a reality.}
{411}{}{Well fuck me sideways, look who came by. The good samaritan who "saved the children" decided to grace me with her presence.

 fuckin' orphanage idea a reality.}
{412}{}{You provide little pianos?}
{413}{}{You sound like you don't like the fact that the children are no longer roaming the streets.}

{420}{}{Hey, don't get me wrong. Life on the street is tough fer them kids, but it's the end of our little arrangement that gets me down.}
{421}{}{What arrangement?}
{422}{}{You mean them pickpocketing from people and bringing the items to you to sell.}

{430}{}{Don't you get smart with me asshole. The kids bring me items they *find.* I don't know where they get them and frankly, I don't give a fuck.}
{431}{}{Right.}
{432}{}{You're full of it. I'm sick of skum like you who use people for their own benefit. Time to die!}

{440}{}{Pai-san-o, you know, the kids. My kids.}
{441}{}{And you have an arrangement with them?}

{450}{}{They bring me stuff that they find. Little, little things. Stuff no one ain't usin' no more. In return, I takes care of 'em.}
{451}{}{Sounds like a nice arrangement.}

{460}{}{Yeah... business was good 'til you came along. See, yer little stunt's gonna cost me. My business is gonna suffer thanks to you.
 Because of this, I don't really like you too much. In fact, I fuckin' hate you. But, I'm a business man, so if you need to barter,
 get to it. If not, fuck off.}
{461}{}{Alright, let's see what you have in stock then.}
{462}{}{I think I have all I need. Goodbye.}
{463}{}{I think I'll stay... and kick your ass.}

{470}{}{You again? You better be here to make some good trades, 'cause I'm getting real fuckin' sick of looking at you.
 In fact, I vomit in my mouth a little every time I see yer face. That's how much you disgust me. And if yer not here to
 trade, then I suggest you turn around and walk the fuck outta here.}
{471}{}{Let's trade.}
{472}{}{Just checking. Well, goodbye Flick.}

{480}{}{You done wastin' my time?}
{481}{}{Let me take another look.}
