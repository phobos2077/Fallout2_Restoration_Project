{100}{}{This hatch looks odd - unlike the rest of the vessel, it's relatively rust free and has an intricate,
 complicated lock.}
 
{200}{}{You struggle with the hatch, but eventually you manage to rip it open. Pieces of the broken lock litter the
 tower and crunch under your boots.}
{201}{}{You try your best, but the hatch just won't budge. Maybe explosives will help.}
{202}{}{Looks like the hatch can be opened if you apply enough force. Marcus might help with that.}

{210}{}{Hey Marcus, can you help me open this hatch?}
{211}{}{Sure, just give me some room.}
{212}{}{*hrrrgnnnr*}
{213}{}{The supermutant struggles to pull the hatch up. For a moment, it looks as if he was about to bust a gut, but
 just then, he rips it open, littering the tower with pieces of the broken lock.}

{220}{}{You fiddle with the lock for a while and open it. Lockpicking's definitely more than just a hobby for you.}
{221}{}{You fiddle with the lock, but ultimately give up. There's got to be another way to open the lock.}

{230}{}{The explosion rips open the hatch and the lock, apart from deafening you.}

{240}{}{You fiddle with the lock for a while and relock it. Lockpicking's definitely more than just a hobby for you.}
{241}{}{You fiddle with the lock, but ultimately give up. There's got to be another way to relock this.}
