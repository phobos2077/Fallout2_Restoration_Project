{100}{}{You see Hank.}
{101}{}{You see a greasy monk.}
{102}{}{He is messing with a still.}

{200}{}{Hey, buddy. Do you have a lighter on you?}
{201}{}{Yep. [Hand your lighter to him.]}
{202}{}{This is perfect. Thanks!}
{203}{}{Out of curiosity, what exactly are you doing here?}
{204}{}{Sure. Since you brought me a lighter, here's one on the house.}
{205}{}{[Drink it.]}
{206}{}{I changed my mind I don't want any alcohol. Bye.}
{207}{}{(You feel warm and relaxed after you gulp down the wine.)}
{208}{}{Gimme another, Hank.}
{209}{}{I'll go now, bye.}
{210}{}{(Suddenly you feel like shit, then your vision begins to blur. You fall on the ground...)}
{211}{}{[DONE]}
{212}{}{No, Sorry.}
{213}{}{Hi, again.}
{214}{}{Hi and bye.}
{215}{}{This one won't be free. It'll cost you $20.}
{216}{}{Sure. Here's the money.}
{217}{}{Nah, I've had enough. Maybe next time.}
{218}{}{(He pockets the money.) Alright then, here's the drink.}
{219}{}{I'll come back when I have more money.}

{220}{}{Any luck finding a lighter?}

{250}{}{I would like to buy some of the alcohol you make here.}
{251}{}{Just looking around. Take care.}
{252}{}{Sure. $20 a bottle.}
{253}{}{[Hold on to it.]}


{300}{}{Where did I put my lighter?}
{301}{}{I need a lighter.}
{302}{}{COULD SOMEONE BRING ME A LIGHTER!?}
{303}{}{Uh, hi there.}
{304}{}{Sorry, I can't chat with you now.}

{400}{}{Ooh, look at all those pretty stars!}

{500}{}{Hello. Need something?}
{501}{}{Hey, thanks again for the lighter. It's better than my old one.}

{600}{}{We brew our own alcohol here at the monastery. Some of the most powerful stuff you'll taste in the Wastes.}
{601}{}{Mind if I try some?}
{602}{}{Sounds interesting. I must be going.}

{700}{}{That's too bad. I lost mine recently and I can't seem to find it anywhere. If you ever get a hold of one,
 I'd be glad to take it off your hands.}
{701}{}{Sure. If I come across one I'll let you know. Bye.}
{702}{}{Sorry. I'm a bit of a collector and keep all that I find. Bye.}
