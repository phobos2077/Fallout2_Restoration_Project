{100}{}{You see a middle aged monk.}
{101}{}{You see Brother Matthew.}
{102}{}{He is standing at a podium preaching to the citizens of the Abbey.}

{200}{}{Good people of the Abbey. Take a moment to listen, for I have much to say.}

#new speech for RP 1.3
{201}{}{Here we collect, the holy relics of an age long past.}
{202}{}{Scorched by the Flame Deluge, into the dark, we were cast.}
{203}{}{A Memorabilia we shall make, to preserve the wisdom of old.}
{204}{}{We must guard and care for it, though the flame has gone cold;}
{205}{}{It could ignite once again, should the wisdom be misused.}
{206}{}{Thus, no one shall learn, for fear of another, Flame Deluge.}
{207}{}{But one day, men shall rise above their desire for destruction.}
{208}{}{And the Memorabilia will be there, awaiting re-introduction.}
{209}{}{So we tend to our holy task, lest all that wisdom, we lose.}
{210}{}{We must preserve and protect it, but never shall we use.}
{211}{}{So go now my friends, and let your spirits be lifted;}
{212}{}{For the guardians of knowledge, we have each, been gifted.}
{213}{}{Now, please take a moment and reflect on what I have said.}

{224}{}{Now, please take a moment and reflect on what I have said.}

{300}{}{Greetings, friend. I don't think I have seen you around here before. My name is Brother Matthew and I help
 spread the word about the importance of preserving the knowledge of the old ones.}
{301}{}{It's good to meet you Matt. My name is }
{302}{}{ and I am on a quest for the holy GECK.}
{303}{}{Sorry, I must be going.}

{400}{}{A GECK, huh? I seem to remember reading something about that during one of my transcribing sessions. So it must
 be in our database, but I'm afraid access to our computers is restricted. However, if you talk to the Abbot, it's
 possible he'll grant you access. It couldn't hurt to try, anyway. Oh, and feel free to browse through our collection
 of holy pre-war relics. I'd ask you not to damage anything, but I'm afraid everything's already broken beyond repair.}
{401}{}{I think I just might. I have some questions though.}
{402}{}{Thanks. I think I'll go do that now.}

{500}{}{I am at your service. What would you like to know?}
{501}{}{What can you tell me about this place?}
{502}{}{You seem to be very poetic in your preaching. Any reason for this?}
{503}{}{Nevermind. Take care.}

{600}{}{The Abbey is home to anyone, so long as they don't cause trouble. We are an independent community and rarely get
 visitors, such as yourself. The majority of those you see here are descended from the original founders that settled in
 this old monastery not long after the great Flame Deluge.}
{601}{}{Go on.}
{602}{}{The quiet, peaceful quality of this place has made it an appealing home to other travelers that have wandered
 here over the years, seeking to escape from the dark chaos of the wastes. Of course, the true value of this place lies
 in its vast library. It's filled with old tomes, containing the strange wisdom of a lost age. Over time, we've come to
 fancy ourselves the keepers and guardians of that wisdom.}
{603}{}{Very interesting. Another question.}
{604}{}{Interesting. Well, I must be going.}

{700}{}{[The man chuckles at your question] No, no particular reason. I have just read much poetry throughout my life
 and I enjoy applying it to my teachings. It helps leave a greater impact on those listening.}
{701}{}{Fair enough. Another question.}

{800}{}{It is good to see you again }
{801}{}{. What can I do for you?}
{802}{}{I have some questions.}
{803}{}{Nothing. See you around.}
