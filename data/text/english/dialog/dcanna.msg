{100}{}{You see a ghost!}
{101}{}{You see Anna the ghost.}

{150}{}{This a ghost. That's not something you see every day.}
{151}{}{She seems quite tormented.}
{152}{}{[TALK]}
{153}{}{Oh, the pain! It burns so!}
{154}{}{What's the matter?}
{155}{}{Who are you?}
{156}{}{Begone, foul spirit!}
{157}{}{I stop and knock at every door, but no one comes, no one hears.}
{158}{}{I can hear you. What's the matter?}
{159}{}{I think you need to turn off your Stealth Boy, ma'am.}
{160}{}{Where is it? I cannot find it! I am lost! Oh....}
{161}{}{What are you looking for? Maybe I can help.}
{162}{}{You really need to stop moaning and groaning and start making sense.}
{163}{}{My locket! It is gone. Thief! Thief!}
{164}{}{Whoa, I just got here. I didn't do it.}
{165}{}{Can I help you find it?}
{166}{}{Oh, cruel fate.}
{167}{}{You can't hear me, can you?}
{168}{}{Later, ghost girl.}
{169}{}{Bye. I'll try to help.}
{170}{}{My locket! Give it to me!!! Oh!!!!}
{171}{}{No way! Go to hell. I found this fair and square.}
{172}{}{OK. Here you go.}
{173}{}{Here. May you rest in peace.}
{174}{}{OK.}
{175}{}{No.}
{176}{}{My locket, my locket! I'm coming, Daddy! I'm coming!}
{177}{}{Goodbye.}
{178}{}{Wait! Don't go!}
{179}{}{Go into the light.}

{200}{}{Where could it be?}
{201}{}{Ohhh.}
{202}{}{Mommy? Daddy? Where are you?}
{203}{}{I can't find it!}

{500}{}{Mommy... Daddy... I'm coming...}
{501}{}{It's so bright...}
{502}{}{Grammy, I can see you...}
{503}{}{Oh, it's the kind Mr. Cain. It's good to see you again...}

{550}{}{This house is clear.}
{551}{}{Oog, pretti bones.}
  
{560}{}{GHOST BUSTER!}
{561}{}{Ug.}
