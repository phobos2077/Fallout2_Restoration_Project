{403}{}{Nikki, I don't know what happened between you and Lloyd. But guess what? I don't NEED to know. I'll just tell
 Mr. Salvatore what I suspect.}
{404}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}

{420}{}{What are you talking about?}
{421}{}{Nikki, if you don't tell me everything right now, I'll tell Mr. Salvatore you were in on it, whether you were or not.
 He'll have Mason cut you up seven ways to Sunday, and have your job filled in an hour.}

 something there. Now, if you don't mind, I got to get back to work.}

# 29. FAIL TO INTIMIDATE NIKKI (30)
{440}{}{Look, I just STARTED working here, and I can't recognize every card counter and two-bit cheat that walks in.
 I gotta pretty good line on shitheads like you, though.}
{441}{}{Oh, so that's how you and Lloyd hooked up then?}
{442}{}{So you just started work, huh? Pretty convenient. Well, that's all I need to know. Tell Lloyd he's a dead man.}

{451}{}{It IS suspicious. You should have had Lloyd pegged for what he was as soon as he walked in this casino.}
{452}{}{Nikki, I know you helped Lloyd cheat. Tell me where Lloyd is, and I'll give you half of his take: 500 chips.}
{453}{}{We'll talk later then, Nikki.}

{470}{}{You talk smooth... but so do snakes. MAYBE I know where Lloyd is, MAYBE I don't. You got 500 chips?}
{471}{}{Maybe. Depends on what you got for me.}

# 33. GO ON . . . (32)
{480}{}{COULD be that Lloyd still has my take, and I ain't sure he's gonna give it to me. So COULD be that - for 500 chips - I
 COULD tell you where his lying ass is hanging out.}
{481}{}{Done. Here's the 500 chips. Tell me where he is.}
{482}{}{That's a pretty steep price for a whole bunch of "maybes" and "coulds." I'll find him on my own.}
{483}{}{I don't have enough chips, but I'll be back. You better still be here when I return.}

# 34. NIKKI SETS PLAYER UP (33)
{490}{}{(Pockets the money) Check the boiler room in the basement of the Desperado. That's where the son of a bitch was
 going to run if things got hot.}

{501}{}{All right then. Later, Nikki.}

# 36. NIKKI PISSED 2 (33)
{510}{}{Go to hell, then! I ain't got nothing else to say to you, EVER.}
