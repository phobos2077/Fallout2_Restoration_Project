{101}{}{You see a guard in power armor.}
{102}{}{You see someone wearing power armor of an unusual design. There is an insignia on the breastplate that you are unfamiliar with.}

{103}{}{Nothing to report.}
{104}{}{Nothing going on with me, how 'bout you?}
{105}{}{Shouldn't you be at your post, soldier? It's not good to wander about here.}

{106}{}{You're out of uniform.}
{107}{}{You better report to the Sarge and get suited up.}
{108}{}{You're taking a big chance being out of uniform. You better report to supply.}

{109}{}{Who the hell are you guys... Alert! Intruders!}
{110}{}{We've been infiltrated! Alert!}
{111}{}{Multiple intruders! Sound the alarm!}

{112}{}{Security alert! Seal the base!}
{113}{}{Secure all stations! We're on alert!}
{114}{}{Intruder alert! Go code red!}

{115}{}{We're going to put you under!}
{116}{}{The Enclave will rule the world!}
{117}{}{You die so that the Enclave will survive!}

{200}{}{...asshole...}
{201}{}{...yeah, you'd BETTER walk away...}
{202}{}{...what a brownie hound...}
{203}{}{...yes, sir! fuckin' sir!...}

{300}{}{Hold on there. What do you think you're doing with that aircraft? There are no scheduled flights for several days.}
{301}{}{Nrg?}
{302}{}{I am aware of this.}
{303}{}{I'm sorry. I was just looking. I'll be going now.}
{304}{}{There's been a change of plans. I'm taking this aircraft.}

{310}{}{What? Oh, I see. Look, don't touch. Okay? Touch again and you die.}
{311}{}{(Smile then attack.)}
{312}{}{(Walk away.)}

{315}{}{Oh shit, looks like we got ourselves an intruder. Code Red! I repeat, code Red!}
{316}{}{That sounds like a good idea. Touch the aircraft again and I'll put a bullet in your head.}

{320}{}{Right. And therefore you are...}
{321}{}{About to leave. Sorry to bother you.}
{322}{}{About to deliver an important message to the main base.}
{323}{}{Oh, really? And what does this message say.}
{324}{}{It's super top secret. I cannot tell you.}
{325}{}{I'll tell you, but it's absolutely essential that you don't disclose this information to anyone else, for fear of a
 mass panic. You see, it's come to my attention that one of the recent shipments of slaves is infected with an unknown, and
 highly deadly, virus strain. I *must* get to the base immediately, or all our lives could be lost. Now stop wasting my time,
 as there isn't a moment to spare.}
{326}{}{Yeah, I believe you. Looks like we got ourselves an intruder...}
{327}{}{Damnit! Ah, whatever. I never get told shit around here. Fine. Be on your way.}
{328}{}{Woah, that sounds bad. You better get moving then, I don't want this shit on my hands. Oh, and don't worry, I won't tell anyone.}
{329}{}{[DONE]}

{422}{}{Me? Oh, I'm, uh, *cough*mumble*cough*. Don't mind me, though. In fact, I should probably be going now.

{424}{}{. Where am I?}
{425}{}{No, what's *your* name, soldier? I was put here to test you and I gotta say you FAILED. If I were a wasteland

{428}{}{You not need know my name. I no like you. I kill. [Jump out and start fighting.]}

{430}{}{What are you, drunk? You're at Navarro, of course. If you're having memory problems, soldier, you might wanna go get yourself checked out. Maybe some of that radiation out there got to you.}

{440}{}{Don't give me that bullshit. You're one of the new recruits, aren't you? Heh. That smart mouth of yours is gonna land you in all sorts of trouble--and I can't wait to see it happen. Now get back to your post, soldier.}
