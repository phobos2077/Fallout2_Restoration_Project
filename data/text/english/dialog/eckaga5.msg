{102}{}{A big hunk of metal with arms and guns.}
{103}{}{I tire of the chase. Let's finish this.}
{104}{}{This is the last time you will meet Kaga.}
{105}{}{You are no match for Kaga.}
{106}{}{I look forward to sending you on your next life.}
{107}{}{You have been a worthy enemy.}

{151}{}{Well, I AM the Chosen One, aren't I?}
{152}{}{Hey now, hold on a second. I never said I was better than you.}
