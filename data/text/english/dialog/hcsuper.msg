{100}{}{You see a weird mutant thing with splotchy skin and a ghastly smile.}
{101}{}{You see the refinery supervisor.}
{102}{}{You see a ghoul. Its skin looks like it's ready to slough off the creature. It also looks like
 it's readily accepted by the other townsfolk.}

{103}{}{You're not supposed to be here!}
{104}{}{What do you want?}
{105}{}{Da yagga! Eep oop op!}
{106}{}{Dunno.}
{107}{}{I have some ore to be refined.}
{108}{}{Who are you?}
{109}{}{What is this place?}
{110}{}{I want some uranium.}
{111}{}{Nothing.}
{112}{}{Forget it. Bye.}

{113}{}{Look, son, I'm sorry that you've got no mind. But you can't be here. Run along now.}
{114}{}{[DONE]}

{115}{}{You can't be here. It's dangerous. Run along now.}
{116}{}{[DONE]}

{117}{}{Great. That'll be $1000, no haggling. You might think that's pricey, but it's a steal
 considering what you'll get for the finished product from an interested buyer.}
{118}{}{It's a deal.}
{119}{}{$1000? That's ridiculous. Forget it.}

{120}{}{I'm the supervisor of this refinery. What do you want?}
{121}{}{What is this place?}
{122}{}{I want some ore refined.}
{123}{}{I want some uranium.}
{124}{}{Nothing.}

{125}{}{This is the refinery of Broken Hills. This is where we purify the ore dug from the mine. What
 do you want?}
{126}{}{What is this place?}
{127}{}{I want some ore refined.}
{128}{}{I want some uranium.}
{129}{}{Nothing.}

{130}{}{You don't have enough money. Come on back when you do.}
{131}{}{[DONE]}

{132}{}{All right. Give us a day and we'll have it ready for you.}
{133}{}{Great. Bye.}

{134}{}{Good luck getting it refined any place else. The process is dangerous -- only a professional
 should do it. You want it or not?}
{135}{}{Yes.}
{136}{}{No.}

{137}{}{Fine. You don't have any business here. Please leave so we can get our jobs done.}
{138}{}{Bye.}

{139}{}{That's ridiculous. We're not giving you any.}
{140}{}{Then die.}
{141}{}{Fine. Bye.}

{142}{}{Hey! Get away from there or you'll suffer the consequences!}

{143}{}{Get out of my refinery! Now!}

{144}{}{We're still working on refining your ore. Give us time. This isn't instantaneous.}
{145}{}{I want to ask you something.}
{146}{}{Fine. Bye.}

{147}{}{Your ore's done. Before you take it, listen - our town really needs this ore. If you donate it to the
 town, I'll refund your money. Hell, if you want more money for it, I can even give you an extra $500 to make it worth your time.
 Please. With the fiasco at the mine, Broken Hills needs this to stay afloat. What do you say?}
{148}{}{No way.}
{149}{}{Sure. Don't worry about the extra $500. You probably need it more than I do.}

{150}{}{Fine. Be that way. Here's your ore. Now get out of my refinery.}
{151}{}{Bye.}

{152}{}{Thanks! Here's your money back. Broken Hills won't forget this.}
{153}{}{No problem.}

{154}{}{I told you to get out of here!}

{155}{}{..little bastard comes in here and <grumble> <rant>...}

{156}{}{An extra $500? Sure, I'll take it.}

{157}{}{Thanks! Here's your money back with an extra $500.}
{158}{}{Great. Thanks.}

{159}{}{You figured out how to get uranium ore refined in Broken Hills.}
{160}{}{You gave the refined ore back to Broken Hills.}
{161}{}{You sold the refined ore back to Broken Hills.}
