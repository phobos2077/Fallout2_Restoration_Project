{100}{}{You see a bartender.}
{101}{}{You see Slim, the bartender.}
{102}{}{You see a bartender. He's wearing an apron and is holding a glass that he constantly cleans by spitting into it and wiping it with a dirty towel. He looks like he doesn't take crap from anyone.}
{103}{}{I'm Slim. What'll you have?}
{104}{}{Me want information.}
{105}{}{What you got?}
{106}{}{No, me go.}
{107}{}{I want some information.}
{108}{}{Show me what you've got.}
{109}{}{Nothing, I'm leaving.}
{110}{}{Information huh? Well I ain't no library and this ain't no computer room. Drink up or get out. Want some booze or not?}
{111}{}{Yes.}
{112}{}{No.}
{113}{}{Fine. If this shit don't kill you, nothing will.}

{121}{}{Ok.}
{122}{}{Welcome back. Need more booze?}
{123}{}{Yes.}
