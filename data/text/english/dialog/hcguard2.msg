{100}{}{You see a tired Hubologist guard.}
{101}{}{He looks pretty bored.}

{200}{}{(Looks at your with bored eyes) Hey. What brings you all the way down here?}
{201}{}{I'm here to let you off duty early. I'm on the next guard shift.}
{202}{}{Ashton sent me to get you. He said he needed to check with you about the recent set of donations.}

{210}{}{Awe, man -- Hey, wait a minute! I've never seen you around before. What are you doing here?}
{211}{}{I'm a new recruit. I was recently transferred here.}
{212}{}{Yeah, I was assigned to kill you.}

{220}{}{Dammit. I don't have time for this crap, my shift's almost over.}
{221}{}{Look, he seemed pretty pissed. I wouln't keep him waiting.}

{230}{}{Ah, hell. Fine. Watch over things while I'm gone. I'll be back in a few minutes.}
{231}{}{No problem.}

{240}{}{New recruit, huh? We get those here from time to time. Pretty boring job doing security here if you ask me. It's better than recruitment
 though, so I aint complaining. Good to have you aboard.}
{241}{}{Thanks. So, I wouldn't keep Ashton waiting if I were you.}
{242}{}{I appreciate the welcome. So, interested in getting off shift early?}

{250}{}{Sure, why the hell not? Nothing exciting happens down here anyway. See you around.}
{251}{}{Take care.}

{260}{}{New recruit? Bullshit. Reinforcements are way too rare out here. Sounds like we got a rat on our hands. So long!}

{300}{}{What the fuck! Aston never asked to see me. I don't know what the hell's going on but there's no record of you being allowed here. Looks to me like we got an intruder on our hands -- Soon to be a dead intruder}
 
{400}{}{Woah, what the hell do you think you're doing!? Trying to rob us, right before my eyes... holy shit, you're a dumbass. Finally, I get to kill someone.}
 
{401}{}{Woah, what the hell do you think you're doing!? This is private property, so don't be touching any of this stuff. This is your only warning.}

{402}{}{I warned you. Trying to rob us, right before my eyes... holy shit, you're a dumbass. Finally, I get to kill someone.}
