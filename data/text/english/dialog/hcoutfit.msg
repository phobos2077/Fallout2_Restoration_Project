{100}{}{You see a medium-sized man wearing dusty clothing.}
{101}{}{You see Bill, the Outfitter.}
{102}{}{You see a medium-sized man in dusty clothing. He smells like he's been tending brahmin.}

{103}{}{Howdy, pard. What can I do for you?}
{104}{}{Nimma ardle ah!}
{105}{}{You give job?}
{106}{}{I'm looking for a job.}
{107}{}{I need to buy stuff.}
{108}{}{What can you tell me about Chad?}
{109}{}{Sorry about Chad. He had it coming.}
{110}{}{Guess your caravan master Chad is in deep shit now.}
{111}{}{Who are you?}

{112}{}{Sorry, kid, but I can't make out a word of what you're saying. Have a lollipop.}
{113}{}{Oooh!}

{114}{}{Sure. There's a heap of brahmin crap out back. Shovel that for a day and I'll give you $100.
 Deal?}
{115}{}{You want a job? Well, we got two choices: Shoveling brahmin dung for a day for $100, or you can
 escort one of our caravans for $200. We got caravans to Gecko, the New California Republic, and Vault
 City.}
{116}{}{Okay!}
{117}{}{Naw.}
{118}{}{I'll shovel the crap for a while.}
{119}{}{I'll do the caravan to Gecko.}
{120}{}{I'll do the caravan to NCR.}
{121}{}{How about Vault City?}
{122}{}{I changed my mind. I'd like something else, instead.}
{123}{}{Bye!}

{124}{}{Yeah? What do you wanna buy?}

{125}{}{You got questions about Chad? Like what?}
{126}{}{Is he skimming off the top?}
{127}{}{Do you trust him?}
{128}{}{What can you tell me about him?}

{129}{}{Me? I'm Bill. I am, as the man said, the Bill you have to pay. Though technically, I suppose,
 sometimes I pay you. I'm the caravan outfitter for this town. I plan the caravan routes and
 arrange for provisioning. I hire people for jobs, and I'm also in charge of the Unity Patrols.}
{130}{}{Jobs? What sort of jobs?}
{131}{}{Thanks. Bye!}

{132}{}{All right. Get started.}

{133}{}{Not interested? All right. Come back when I can do something for you.}
{134}{}{Okay!}
{135}{}{Well, actually, I was interested in something else.}
{136}{}{Bye.}

{137}{}{All right. Gecko it is. Come back on the 1st of the month and you'll be on your way. Want anything else?}
{138}{}{Yes.}
{139}{}{No.}

{140}{}{All right. The Republic it is. Come back on the 11th of the month and you'll be on your way. Want anything else?}
{141}{}{All right. Vault City it is. Come back on the 21st of the month and you'll be on your way. Want anything else?}

{142}{}{What do you want?}
{143}{}{I'm looking for a job.}
{144}{}{I need to buy stuff.}
{145}{}{What can you tell me about Chad?}
{146}{}{Sorry about Chad. He had it coming.}
{147}{}{Guess your caravan master's in deep shit now.}
{148}{}{Who are you?}

{149}{}{Nice dealin' with ya'. You want anything more from me?}
{150}{}{Sorry. That doesn't cut it for me. You want anything more from me?}
{151}{}{No. Bye!}

{152}{}{Y'done? Great. Here's your $100, and if you need anything else, just let me know.}

{153}{}{Pal, come back in an hour or two and I'll be happy to sell you something. Right now, I'm busy
 with these brahmin. Do you want something else?}

{154}{}{Is he skimming off the top? Not as far as I can tell. For a load of uranium, we charge $5,000.
 We get back $5,000. Ain't no skimming there, far as I can tell. He's got a nice place and always seems
 to have plenty of cash, but he might've brought that with him when came here.}
{155}{}{I have a few more questions.}
{156}{}{I want some other things.}
{157}{}{I see. That's all. Thanks.}

{158}{}{Do I trust him? Obviously ... to an extent. I trust him to run my caravans for me. He might be
 shady, but 'til he gives me a reason not to trust him, I'll keep on like I have.}
{159}{}{I have some more questions.}
{160}{}{I want some other things.}
{161}{}{Great. Thanks for your time.}

{162}{}{Lessee. He came to Broken Hills out of the desert. He didn't have much but his smarts. He looked
 like he was being hunted by someone, but wouldn't say who. He was always real quiet about his past.
 And ... he's a hell of a caravan master. That's all.}
{163}{}{I have some more questions.}
{164}{}{I want some other things.}
{165}{}{Thanks.}

{166}{}{I'm off duty now. Talk to me when I'm at the shop.}

{167}{}{He had it coming? You piece of crap, money ain't worth killing over. Get the hell out of my
 store.}
{168}{}{Bye.}

{169}{}{Any trouble he's in, he made for himself. Too bad... he was a hell of a caravan master. You want
 something?}

{170}{}{Out of my store. Y'ain't wanted here.}

{171}{}{You ready to go to Vault City?}

{172}{}{Ready to go to NCR?}

{173}{}{You ready to go to Gecko?}

{174}{}{Caravan's canceled. We're not sending any more down to that piece of shit hellhole, not if
 they're going to try to kill our people. You want anything else?}

{175}{}{Are you crapping out on my caravan?}
{176}{}{Well, I need more time here.}
{177}{}{I wanted to change caravan assignments.}

{178}{}{More time? Fine. You got more time. Come back when you intend to fulfill your responsibilities.}

{179}{}{Change? What caravan do you want? Gecko leaves on the 1st, NCR on the 11th, and Vault City on the 21st.}
{180}{}{NCR.}
{181}{}{Gecko.}
{182}{}{Vault City.}

{183}{}{Yeah? Fine. Get out of my store. Come back when you got enough guts to make the trip.}

{184}{}{Great. Then get going.}
{185}{}{I wanted something else first.}
{186}{}{All right.}

{187}{}{Pal, I can't do anything else for you now. With all the mutants dead, we got no one to work the
 mine effectively. This town's gonna ghost in a year or two. Ain't nothing else here. So long.}

{188}{}{Sorry, pal. I got nothing for you to do anymore. Ya' shoveled all the crap I had.}
{189}{}{You want a job? Well, seein' as you shoveled all the brahmin crap, all I got left is caravans.
 You can escort one of 'em for $200. We got caravans to Gecko, the New California Republic,
 and Vault City. They go out once a week.}
{190}{}{Awwwww darrn. Me lyk braaaamin craaap. Bye Bye.}
{191}{}{You want a job? Well, seein' as you shoveled all the brahmin crap, all I got left is caravans.
 You can escort one of 'em for $200. We got caravans to Gecko and Vault City. They go out once a week.}
{192}{}{You want a job? Well, we got two choices: Shoveling brahmin dung for a day for $100, or you can

{193}{}{You have become an expert excrement expeditor!}
{194}{}{Your Speech skill increased by 5%.}

{195}{}{I'll take a caravan.}
{196}{}{You already said you would go to Gecko on the 1st of the month.}
{197}{}{You already said you would go to NCR on the 11th of the month.}
{198}{}{You already said you would go to Vault City on the 21st of the month.}

{200}{}{I'd like to change caravans.}
{201}{}{Oh, that's right. Nevermind.}
{202}{}{You bastard! You abandoned the goddamn caravan! Get the hell out of here!}
{203}{}{Nevermind. I'll pass on the caravans for now.}

{204}{}{All right. Gecko it is. The caravan leaves today. Are you ready to go?}
{205}{}{All right. The Republic it is. The caravan leaves today. Are you ready to go?}
{206}{}{All right. Vault City it is. The caravan leaves today. Are you ready to go?}
{207}{}{Yep, I'm all set. Let's go.}
{208}{}{Not quite yet. I'll let you know when I'm ready. Thanks.}
{209}{}{Not yet. I'll let you know when I'm ready. I have some more questions.}

{210}{}{Thanks.}
{211}{}{[continue]}

{212}{}{I'm sorry, but without Chad around to help manage personnel, I can't be givin' out work the way I used to. I'm gonna miss
 that poor bastard. Dyin' out in the wastes like some wounded brahmin.}
{213}{}{Sorry. Bye.}
{214}{}{I'm sorry, but without Chad around to help manage personnel, I can't be givin' out work the way I used to.}
