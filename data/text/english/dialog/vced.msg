{100}{}{You see a gap-toothed man in a dirty blue shirt. He smells strongly of brahmin.}
{101}{}{You see Ed, the Brahmin Dealer.}
{102}{}{Damn brahmin. Mooing here, mooing there.}
{103}{}{Swear I heard one of them brahmin speak. "Moo, I say," or somesuch.}
{104}{}{Been a slow season for selling brahmin.}
{105}{}{No idea where all that brahmin crap keeps coming from. Just seems to appear.}
{106}{}{Well, hello there, stranger. I'm Ed, the local brahmin dealer. Help you with something?}
{107}{}{Good to see you again. What can I do you for?}
{108}{}{Do you know a trader named Vic? He said he bought this Vault water flask from you.}
{109}{}{Do you know a trader named Vic?}
{110}{}{My friend Vic here says he bought a water flask from you.}
{111}{}{Any luck remembering where you got the water flask from?}
{112}{}{I'm looking for the Vault.}
{113}{}{Can you tell me about Vault City?}
{114}{}{What do you do around here?}
{115}{}{Goodbye.}
{116}{}{Vic?}
{117}{}{He sold a water flask to you? One with "13" on it?}
{118}{}{Nevermind. I have to be going.}
{119}{}{You got it? Maybe that could spark my memory.}
{120}{}{Nevermind then. I had some other questions for you...}
{121}{}{I'll see if I can go dig it up. I'll be back.}
{122}{}{Oh, yeah, yeah... I remember. It's been a long time, Vic. A water flask, huh? What about it?}
{123}{}{Oh, yeah, yeah... fat guy, right? Leather vest? Balding? I remember him. What about him?}
{124}{}{Can you tell me where the flask came from?}
{125}{}{He said he sold a water flask to you?}
{126}{}{Just checking to see if you knew him. Thanks.}
{127}{}{You know, I can't quite recall... I had a bunch of 'em for a long time. I think I picked them up during one of my brahmin drives. Didn't need 'em much when I settled down.}
{128}{}{Brahmin drives?}
{129}{}{Oh. Well, thanks anyway, then.}
{130}{}{When I was a lot younger, I used to drive brahmin through the 'Big Circle'... Broken Hills, New Reno, Redding, the Den, Modoc, then back here. It just got too dangerous after a while, so I settled here.}
{131}{}{Where are these places?}
{132}{}{I see. Well, thanks for the information.}
{133}{}{Let me mark it on your map. See, Broken Hills is south... bear west on the trail from there, and you'll hit Reno.
 Northwest o' Reno is Redding, then it's north to the Den, east to Modoc, then east to here, Vault City.}
{134}{}{Any idea which of those places you got the flask from?}
{135}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{136}{}{Sorry, can't remember exactly. It was a long time ago. Why do you want to know?}
{137}{}{I'm looking for the Vault the flask came from.}
{138}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{139}{}{Well, hell, if it's a Vault you're looking for, then there's one inside the walls of Vault City.}
{140}{}{Vault 13 is inside the city?}
{141}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{142}{}{Well, now, don't know if it's "13" exactly, but there's a Vault. If that ain't the one you're looking for, the vault's central computer might know where the others are. They've damn near listed everything in it.}
{143}{}{I had some other questions...}
{144}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{145}{}{Shoot. What did you want to know?}
{146}{}{Do you know a trader named Vic? He said he bought this Vault water flask from you.}
{147}{}{Do you know a trader named Vic?}
{148}{}{My friend Vic here says he bought a water flask from you.}
{149}{}{Any luck remembering where you got the water flask from?}
{150}{}{I'm looking for the Vault.}
{151}{}{Can you tell me about Vault City?}
{152}{}{What do you do around here?}
{153}{}{Goodbye.}
{154}{}{Well... there's that Vault inside the main part of the city. You checked it out yet? Could be the one you're looking for.}
{155}{}{Well... there's a Vault inside the main part of the city. That what you're looking for?}
{156}{}{Perhaps. I had some other questions...}
{157}{}{Could be. Thanks for the information.}
{158}{}{Okay place... if you can deal with the Citizens. I don't agree with some of their views, but hey, I make a pretty good living here.}
{159}{}{I had some other questions...}
{160}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{161}{}{I sell brahmin to people who need them. Helps me pay rent on this place.}
{162}{}{I had some other questions...}
{163}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{164}{}{I got brahmin smarter than you. Move along.}
{165}{}{This looks like Ed's place. He's the one I bought that water flask from.}
{166}{}{You have discovered the origin of the water flask.}
