{103}{}{You're not getting out of here alive, mutie.}
{104}{}{You damn mutant.}

{108}{ssa2}{You (cough), you haven't won here. You and your mutie-bastard friends are gonna join me in a big ol' mushroom cloud sendoff. I just triggered the self-destruct.

# Node 3
{112}{ssa3alt}{You've gotten a lot farther than you should have, but then you haven't met Frank Horrigan either. Your ride's over, mutie. Time to die.}
{113}{}{I'm going past you whether you like it or not.}
{114}{}{Can't we talk this over?}

# Node 4
{115}{ssa4a}{Dumping the FEV toxin into our air doesn't make you a hero. You're just another mutant that needs to be put down.}
{116}{ssa4b}{Making our reactor melt-down means that things are going to be pretty hot in here soon. Pity you won't live long enough to see it. You're not a hero; you're just a walking corpse.}
