{100}{}{You see a Hubologist guard.}
{101}{}{He is built like a rock and is well armed.}

{200}{}{Halt! This is private property of the Church of Hubology. What is your business here?}
{201}{}{I've come to loot this place. I hear there's plenty of wealth for the taking.}
{202}{}{Do not fret, brother, for we are kindred spirits. I too, embrace the Church of Hubology.}
{203}{}{Oh yeah? [He looks you up and down.] Then you won't mind if I quiz you on our faith.}
{204}{}{[He grins savagely.] You're a bold one. I like that. Let's see how bold you are when I leave you bleeding into the dust.}
{205}{}{Ask away. I am ready.}
{206}{}{A quiz, huh? You know what? Screw this--I lied. Let's fight.}

{220}{}{Who was the founder of the Church?}
{221}{}{The Church believes that life, the universe, and everything can be symbolized by what?}
{222}{}{In the context of the Church, what is meant by the term "Enlightenment"?}

{230}{}{Herbert Jentz}
{231}{}{Dick Hubbel}
{232}{}{Juan Cruz}
{233}{}{AHS-9}
{234}{}{Hugo Richardson}

{240}{}{A circle.}
{241}{}{Money.}
{242}{}{A turning wheel.}
{243}{}{Odin's horn.}
{244}{}{A fish.}

{250}{}{The replenishing of bodily essence.}
{251}{}{A state of complete euphoria.}
{252}{}{A state achieved in which the seeker develops divine understanding of the true nature of things.}
{253}{}{A state achieved when the seeker has gained so much knowledge he becomes an integral part of the universe
 and leaves this earthly existence behind.}
{254}{}{The final attainment on the spiritual path, when the limited sense of "I" merges into supreme "We".}

{260}{}{That's correct. Only a fellow Hubologist could have such wisdom. I welcome you, and beg your pardon. May I ask why you've come here? Very few of our members even know of this location.}
{261}{}{Ha! Not even close. The tried and true quiz security method works every time. Now, to rid the world of you, imposter!}

{270}{}{I was asked by AHS-9 to check on all the donations. He wants to make sure everything is in order here.}
{271}{}{I have come to make a donation.}

{280}{}{Oh, I didn't know you were following such divine orders. In that case, you're free to enter. Here, let me unlock this door for you.}
{281}{}{[He frowns.] Huh, I was never told about any inspections...}
{282}{}{Thanks. See you around.}
{283}{}{Listen, I was personally told by AHS-9 to check on things. He asked that I collect a specific artifact that was donated recently. It is crucial for reaching the Star Father.}
{284}{}{I'm getting real sick of your lies. I think it's time I remove one more weed from the world.}

{290}{}{But this isn't where you go to donate. You can go do that at any of our churches.}
{291}{}{I know this, but AHS-9 told me new recruits are allowed to check on things before one gives considerable contributions.}
{292}{}{[He frowns.] Huh, I was never told about any inspections...}
{293}{}{Oh, I see. That's understandable. You're free to enter, just don't loiter around for too long.}
{294}{}{Listen, I'm about to give a hefty sum of money to the Church. I want to make sure my donation will be safe and used
 appropriately.}

{300}{}{Hello again.}
{301}{}{I hope everything is in order.}

{400}{}{Me want in.}
{410}{}{[He looks at you oddly.] Well, you'll need a password then.}
{411}{}{Me pass gas, not word.}
{412}{}{Me want in!}
{420}{}{Listen, I don't have time for this. You clearly shouldn't be here, so beat it or you'll be sorry.}
{421}{}{Buh bye!}
{422}{}{Me want goodies inside. U die now.}

{430}{}{Last chance. Leave now or die.}
{431}{}{I warned you!}
