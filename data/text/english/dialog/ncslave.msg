# 11. [BEATEN SLAVE vs. SLAVER]
{260}{}{Yes, I am already owned. My master has the papers.}
{261}{}{Please leave me be. I am already owned by someone else.}
{262}{}{I beg you: have you seen two children, dark-hair...? They were taken by other slavers two years ago and sold North.}
{263}{}{Please... I am not allowed to speak to anyone.}
{264}{}{Please... let me be. My master will be back soon.}
{265}{}{If my master catches me talking to a slaver, I will be beaten.}
{266}{}{I already have a master. She will not be happy if you continue to talk to me.}
{267}{}{I cannot speak to you. I have duties.}
{268}{}{If I am caught speaking to a slaver, they will start testing the drugs on me.}
{269}{}{Please go away, slaver. I don't want any trouble.}
{270}{}{Escape? I... have never tried to escape from here. I would not dare disobey my master.}
# 12. [BEATEN AND/OR GENERIC SLAVE]
{280}{}{If they catch me talking to you, they will start testing drugs on me.}
{281}{}{I used to work with this other slave, but he died of an overdose a few days ago.}
{282}{}{They test new drugs on us. Some are poisonous.}
{283}{}{My master is... good to me.}
{284}{}{My master said not to speak to others.}
{285}{}{Please... I am not allowed to speak to you.}
{286}{}{Please let me be. My master will be back soon.}
{287}{}{If my master catches me talking to you, he will beat me.}
{288}{}{My master is good. He does not beat me often.}
{289}{}{I do not miss my family. My master is kind.}
{290}{}{I was taken from a tribal village north of here. Life is much... better here.}
{291}{}{I was first captured in the Den.}
{292}{}{I cannot speak to you. I have work to do.}
{293}{}{I must finish my duties before my master returns.}
{294}{}{Speaking is against the rules.}
{295}{}{Please go away. I beg you. You're only going to get me in trouble.}
{296}{}{Escape? There is nowhere to escape TO. The Wastes are filled with horrible monsters that will eat runaways alive.}
{297}{}{Slaves who become sick are usually killed.}
{298}{}{I was one of the slaves who made it to New Reno. Two others got sick during the trip, so the slavers shot them.}
{299}{}{Yes? How can I help you?}
{300}{}{I hear rumors of an underground railroad, but I don't know anyone who escaped.}
{301}{}{Julia escaped, but they caught her in Golgotha the next day. They tied her to a wheel and let her starve to death.}
{302}{}{Runaway slaves are caught and left to die in Golgotha.}
{303}{}{No, I don't know where my family is now. I still think about them sometimes, but not so often anymore.}
{304}{}{New Reno is... well, it is not as bad as the Den. In some ways.}
{305}{}{::Turns away, frightened.::}
{306}{}{::Ignores you, frightened.::}
{307}{}{Once you learn your new master's needs, the beatings become less... frequent.}
{308}{}{I was captured by slavers long ago. I barely remember it.}
{309}{}{I used to have two children, but they were shipped northwards. I hope they ended up somewhere better than here.}
{310}{}{I'm sorry, but I don't have time to talk.}
{311}{}{My master recently has become upset with me. He says he will sell me to the stables if I anger him again.}
{312}{}{Runaway slaves die on Golgotha or are shipped to the Stables for testing.}
