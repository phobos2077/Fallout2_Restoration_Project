{101}{}{You see a Vertibird.}

{201}{}{Status.}
{202}{}{Log off.}
{203}{}{This aircraft has only enough fuel for a complete round trip flight from the Navarro outpost, to the docking rig, and back again.
 All procedures are fully automated and thus no intervention by crew members is needed. Current fuel status is: Full.}
{204}{}{Fly to Oil Rig.}
{205}{}{Log off.}
{206}{}{Error. Yellow Reactor Keycard not inserted. All pilots are issued this card upon clearance for takeoff.
 Automated flight cannot occur without the presence of this clearance card.}
{207}{}{Insert card.}
{208}{}{Shit. Looks like I will have to find this card.}
{209}{}{Keycard accepted. Aircraft is now activated.}
{210}{}{Run pre-flight diagnostics.}
{211}{}{Log off.}

{212}{}{Beginning system diagnostics...35% complete...75% complete...100% complete. All systems appear operational. Checking for response from docking rig...}

{214}{}{No signal returned from docking rig. Reason: Satellites not aligned for automated docking with Oil Rig. Please make sure docking rig is aware of the presence of incoming aircrafts.}
{215}{}{Hmm... Looks like I will have to find a way to align the satellites.}
{216}{}{Urg?}

{220}{}{Aircraft currently activated. Command?}
{221}{}{Run pre-flight diagnostics.}
{222}{}{Log off.}

{230}{}{Test signal received. Retrieving docking coordinates... complete. Aircraft ready for takeoff.}
{231}{}{Go.}
{232}{}{Log off.}

{240}{}{Aircraft is locked in on target. Flight time is approximately 6 hours. Enjoy your flight.}
{241}{}{This is it -- the moment of truth. The tribe is in trouble and it's all up to me. My feet are sore, my entire body
 aches, and I don't remember the last time I ate a decent meal. These are the moments we live for. There's no turning back.
 It's time to show the world what }
{242}{}{ is made of. Bring it on, Enclave!}
{243}{}{Hehe... Fly birdie, fly! }
{244}{}{ save day now.}
