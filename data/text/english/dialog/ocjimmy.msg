{100}{}{You see a tall, lanky man with thick glasses.}
{101}{}{You see Jimmy.}
{102}{}{You see a tall, lanky man wearing thick glasses. His brow is furrowed in deep thought and he talks to himself as he wanders about the room.}
{103}{}{Oh, hello there. I'm Jim, or Jimmy. Whatcha up to?}
{104}{}{Me look around.}
{105}{}{Me}
{106}{}{Uh... Me wander about. Me go now.}
{107}{}{Just looking around.}
{108}{}{Hi, Jim. I'm}
{109}{}{None of your business, four eyes. Back off.}
{110}{}{I'm just wandering about. I'll be leaving now.}
{111}{}{Feel free to look all you want but please don't touch anything. There's some sensitive equipment in here.}
{112}{}{Me just look around. Me no touch.}
{113}{}{I'm just looking around. I won't bother anything.}
{114}{}{You're annoying. Go away.}
{115}{}{Hey, sorry. I didn't mean to step on your toes. I'll leave you to your business.}
{116}{}{Good.}
{117}{}{It's a pleasure to meet you,}
{118}{}{What would you like to know?}
{119}{}{What you do here?}
{120}{}{What all this machine?}
{121}{}{Vault have overseer. This overseer room?}
{122}{}{You here in vault cause you want be?}
{123}{}{What you think about D'claws?}
{124}{}{Computer need part. You know where get?}
{125}{}{Me know enough. Me go now.}
{126}{}{What do you do here?}
{127}{}{What's all this machinery for?}
{128}{}{Isn't this the vault overseer room?}
{129}{}{Are you here in the vault because you want to be?}
{130}{}{What do you think about the deathclaws?}
{131}{}{The computer needs a part. Do you know where I might be able to get it?}
{132}{}{I think I'll be going now.}
{133}{}{Well... we're having some computer problems and I'm looking into it. Unfortunately my forte is software, not hardware.}
{134}{}{What problem?}
{135}{}{What's the problem?}
{136}{}{Yes, Gruthar mentioned this to me and asked me to take a look. Do you mind?}
{137}{}{The voice interface to the mainframe has failed so Gruthar can't give the system instructions for running the vault. The food and water processors have already shut down. The power systems could very well be next.}
{138}{}{Why you no use keebored?}
{139}{}{Why not just give it keyboard input?}
{140}{}{Well, you see, that's the weird part. The system refuses to accept keyboard input. I'm at a loss as to what to do at this point.}
{141}{}{Okay me look?}
{142}{}{Mind if I take a look at it?}
{143}{}{Yes, Gruthar mentioned this to me and asked me to take a look. Do you mind?}
{144}{}{Well... no offense, but are you sure you're qualified? Oh, never mind. You can't possibly make matters any worse than they already are. Go right ahead.}
{145}{}{You can't make matters any worse than they already are. Go right ahead.}
{146}{}{Okay, but me ask more questions first.}
{147}{}{All right, but I need to ask you a couple of things first.}
{148}{}{This is a mainframe computer system and related support devices. From here all functions of the vault are remotely controlled.}
{149}{}{Uh... what you said.}
{150}{}{Ah, I see.}
{151}{}{Normally the vault overseer would be stationed here but Vault 13 has been fully automated.}
{152}{}{Why?}
{153}{}{Okay, me ask more.}
{154}{}{Why? I mean, isn't that unusual?}
{155}{}{I see. Let's change the subject.}
{156}{}{I don't know the full story but at one point in the vault's history there was a rebellion. The overseer was either killed or overthrown, I'm not sure which. Anyway, the leaders of the revolution didn't want to entrust the fate of the people to another overseer so they installed this mainframe. The records say it was purchased from... oh, what was that name... Ah, I remember, the 'Brotherhood of Steel.'}
{157}{}{You tell about Brotherhood?}
{158}{}{Can you tell me anything about this Brotherhood?}
{159}{}{No, I'm sorry, but I have no information on them. This all happened ages ago and I've never found any references to them other than this one. However, it's my understanding that the Brotherhood was a military outfit and there are some ruins of what appears to be a military base west of here. That may be what's left of them.}
{160}{}{Ok. Me ask other thing.}
{161}{}{All right. Let me ask you some other things then.}
{162}{}{Oh yeah. I've liked it here ever since I stumbled upon the place and I don't really want to leave. I've always been a loner and don't much care for people, no offense intended.}
{163}{}{Me take none.}
{164}{}{None taken.}
{165}{}{Well... In some ways I admire them for what they are and what they are trying to become. In other ways they scare the hell out of me. I don't think I'll ever get used to the fact that they are just as smart as I am... well, some of them are that smart.}
{166}{}{You think they threat to people?}
{167}{}{Do you think they are a threat to human society?}
{168}{}{Oh, absolutely. They are far superior to us physically and they are our equals mentally. That makes them a pretty big threat. However, it all comes down to morals and ethics in the end. Fortunately, they seem to be ethical and morally well developed.}
{169}{}{Me see.}
{170}{}{Yeah, I see what you mean.}
{171}{}{Hi there. It's good to see you again. What can I help you with?}
{172}{}{Need ask question.}
{173}{}{Just say hi. Me go.}
{174}{}{I need to ask you something.}
{175}{}{Just saying hi.}
{176}{}{Well, let's see... I suppose the best place to look would be Vault City since they're the most modern place I can think of. You might want to give New Reno a try though. They're closer and they do a lot of trading with Vault City.}
{177}{}{Thanks.}
{178}{}{Thanks for fixing the computer. You've saved all our butts.}
{179}{}{I've got better things to do than shoot the likes of you, but everyone needs a vacation!}

{180}{}{. Me ask question?}
{181}{}{. Can I ask you some questions?}
{182}{}{. I'd be happy to answer some questions.}
{183}{}{You should let Gruthar know that you fixed the computer.}
