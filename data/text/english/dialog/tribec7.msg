{102}{}{You see a young, full figured tribal woman with several piercings and tattoos.}

{150}{}{[END]}

{200}{}{Sulik! [She catches herself and begins to whisper.] Do the spirits be teasing, or is that really you, brother?}
{201}{}{Me? No, I'm the Chosen One. You must be thinking of old bone nose here.}
{202}{}{[Sulik rushes to the gate door and clasps the outstretched hands of his sister. You turn away to give some privacy to their emotional reunion. Moments later, a twig snaps outside the building. Sulik lets go of his sister and reaches for his weapon as he glances at the door. No more sounds come from outside.]}
{203}{}{[MORE]}
{204}{}{[Sulik's sister turns to you.] Bonespirits say you be leading Sulik. Name's Kurisu, but now not the time for proper greetin'. Please, you needin' to get us out of cage and away from de wicked men ruled by spirits of lust. [She sneers and spits in the dirt.] Filthy dogs will not be laying hands on us again. [Upon hearing this, Sulik's eyes widen as his face contorts with rage. He reaches for his weapon.]}
{205}{}{Hold on there, Sulik, we're outnumbered here. Let me see if I can lockpick this door and we can sneak our way
 out of here.}
{206}{}{Hold on there, Sulik, we're outnumbered here. I got the key to this door. Let's keep it quiet and we'll sneak our
 way out of here.}
{207}{}{[You nod at Sulik] These bastards will pay. Lock and load ol' buddy.}
{208}{}{[A few minutes pass by and you finally hear a click from the lock. The door swings open.]}
{209}{}{[You turn to Kurisu.] Alright, stay close and keep your head down. [To the other slaves.] Keep quiet and head for the woods.}
{210}{}{[A few minutes pass by and you are unsuccessful at unlocking the door.]}
{211}{}{There must be another way to unlock this door. Let me see if I can get a key somehow. Wait here, I'll be back for you.}
{212}{}{Alright Sulik, it's time for your plan. Time to take out the trash.}
{213}{}{[You put the key in the lock and unlock the gate, it screeches as it opens.]}

{214}{}{Any luck, fren? Please hurry.}
{215}{}{Not yet. I'm still working on it.}
{216}{}{I got the keys. Time to get you out of here.}
{217}{}{Why there be so much commotion out there? Ah, I sense many have gone to join the spirits. Who be... Sulik? Do the spirits be teasing, or is that really you, brother?}

{223}{}{[Sulik rushes to the gate door and clasps the outstretched hands of his sister. You turn away to give some privacy to their emotional reunion. Moments later, his sister turns to you.] Bonespirits say you be leading Sulik. Name's Kurisu, but now not the time for proper greetin'. The Slavers, they be dead, yes?}
{224}{}{Yes, the slavers are dead.}
{225}{}{Praise the spirits! Please, unlock this door. We eager to go from this evil place.}
{226}{}{Don't worry. I got a key.}
{227}{}{Alright, let me try and lockpick this door.}

{400}{}{Let's keep moving.}
{401}{}{Please, I wantin' to be home.}

{410}{}{[You turn to Kurisu.] Wait, I don't want to leave here until I free the slaves in the other holding pens. You wait
 here until I free everyone from this camp. [To the other slaves.] Keep quiet and head for the woods. I'll handle the guards.}

{500}{}{If you be choosin' me for a lay, you best expect a fight -- wait, you don't be having the demon mark on your head. Who you be?}

{530}{}{It be safe yet? You sent the slavers to the spirits?}
{531}{}{Yes, it's safe. We can go to your village now.}
{532}{}{Yes, but let me free all the slaves here first before we go.}

{533}{}{No, not yet. I'll be back when it's safe.}

{600}{}{Praise the spirits, we be home at last! Thank you so much, fren.}
{601}{}{You're welcome. So, how exactly were you captured?}
{602}{}{Was trading in nearby village. Slavers came. Much bloodshed and chaos. Then, everything go dark. Awoke in packed cage reeking of shit. Soon moved to smaller cage, with ones they like to be keeping. Peeped many slaves come and go. Sad to see people be treated like cattle.}
{603}{}{Yeah, slavery is certainly a horrible thing. I'm sorry you had to go through that, Kurisu. So, what are you gonna do now?}
{604}{}{Slavers hurt me, but I far from broken. The spirits guided you to ensure my freedom. Clearly, the spirits be planning something big for me. Spirits got big plans for you, too. And brother Sulik. He will be much missed, but the spirits say his place is walking by-and-by with you. Hell, even Grampy Bone like you, so I know Sulik in good hands. You take care.}
{605}{}{Thank you, Kurisu, see you around.}
{606}{}{Slavers hurt me, but I far from broken. The spirits guided you to ensure my freedom. Clearly, the spirits be planning something big for me. Soon, I think I be going to hunt down brother. Knowing Sulik, he prolly got in trouble, trying to come help me. Now, perhaps I be the one helping him.}
{607}{}{Actually, I think I've seen your brother. Face full of tattoos and a big bone in the nose, right?}
{608}{}{That be Sulik alright! And Grampy Bone, too! Please, could you go bring Sulik home? I be missing that man so much.}
{609}{}{No problem, I'll bring him here. See you around, Kurisu.}
{610}{}{I don't think I can do that. You see, Sulik is dead.}
{611}{}{Sulik... dead? Truly, this be a dark day. I know he be with Grampy now, but Sulik... he will be much missed. [She looks away as tears fill her eyes.] Please... I need being alone now. Thank you... for bringing me home.}


{650}{}{Hello, fren. Any lu-- Sulik!}
{651}{}{[MORE]}
{652}{}{[Kurisu rushes to Sulik, who sweeps her up into an embrace. You turn away to give them some privacy during their emotional reunion. Several moments later, Kurisu turns to you with a grin as she wipes tears from her eyes.] Thank you, fren, for finding brother. Spirits got big plans for you and Sulik. He will be much missed, but the spirits say his place is walking by-and-by with you. Hell, even Grampy Bone like you, so I know Sulik in good hands. You take care.}
