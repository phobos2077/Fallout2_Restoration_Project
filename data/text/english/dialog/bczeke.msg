{100}{}{You see an older squatter.}
{101}{}{You see Zeke, a squatter.}
{102}{}{You see an older man with thinning, white hair.}
{103}{}{My name's Zeke, stranger. I'm sorry, but I don't have time to talk to you -- and I don't think
 there's anything in this town for you, anyway. You should move on.}
{104}{}{Uh, okay.}
{105}{}{Me got questions.}
{106}{}{All right, I'll leave.}
{107}{}{I just wanted to ask a couple of questions.}
{108}{}{Well, I think you'll find that we're all out of answers here. Why don't you come back when we
 get a shipment in?}
{109}{}{Done.}
{110}{}{Hello, again. I still don't have any answers for you, stranger. Why don't you take a hint and
 get the duck out of fodge?}
{111}{}{Done.}
{112}{}{Rebecca has told me what you did for her. I want to apologize for the treatment you received
 here. You certainly didn't deserve it. What can I help you with?}
{113}{}{Me got questions.}
{114}{}{Nothing. Wavy.}
{115}{}{I've got some questions for you.}
{116}{}{Nothing for now, thanks.}
{117}{}{What do you want to know?}
{118}{}{You work for Darion?}
{119}{}{What you do about raiders?}
{120}{}{Where vault door?}
{121}{}{Anything else go on here?}
{122}{}{Me leave now.}
{123}{}{Do you work for Darion?}
{124}{}{What do you intend to do about the raiders?}
{125}{}{Where is the vault entrance?}
{126}{}{Is there anything else going on around here?}
{127}{}{I guess that's it. I'll be going now.}
{128}{}{Yes, I do. I act as the middle man between him and the people up here. I'm not very happy about
 the fact, now that I know what he's up to.}
{129}{}{Okay.}
{130}{}{I see.}
{131}{}{Nothing. They have the guns, they control the water, and they control the food. That means
 they are in charge. Period. We have no skills and no means of support without the backing of Darion.
 How can we turn against him? We're at his mercy.}
{132}{}{Hmm. Me think me understand.}
{133}{}{Hmm. I see.}
{134}{}{It's behind that door over there, but it's locked from the other side and trapped, too. I don't have
 any means of opening it... Wait a minute. I found this key card some time ago, and I have no idea what
 it is for. Rebecca says that you found some sort of door where they were holding Chrissy. Maybe this
 card will open it. Here, take it.}
{135}{}{Me thank you.}
{136}{}{Thanks. I'll give it a try.}
{137}{}{There's a city west of here called NCR. They claim Vault 15 is their ancestral home and they want it
 back. They've been sending people here trying to talk us into leaving but we aren't going for it. This is the only home we know.}
{138}{}{You maybe make deal NCR?}
{139}{}{Would you consider making a deal with NCR?}
{140}{}{That all depends. What did you have in mind?}
{141}{}{Join NCR tribe. Learn from elders. Give NCR you permission enter vault. Both happy.}
{142}{}{Join NCR, let them annex your territory, and give them access to the vault. In return, they can teach you all the skills
 you need to survive on your own and offer you their protection.}
{143}{}{Not bad... I like it. You've got yourself a deal if you can get NCR to agree to it as well. But...
 Look, someone has to take care of Darion and his cronies. It should be done now before they realize what has happened
 and have time to prepare for an attack. Why not get this over with and take Darion out now?
 You'll have the element of surprise on your side.}
{144}{}{You right, me take care of.}
{145}{}{Me not sure.}
{146}{}{Yeah, I guess it has to be done.}
{147}{}{I don't know.}
{148}{}{Excellent. Good luck to you, and thank you.}
{149}{}{Done.}
{150}{}{Well, take the time to think about it, but know this -- until Darion is out of the picture, I
 have no choice but to maintain things around here as they are. It's for the safety of everyone
 concerned. That means no deal and you are still persona non grata. Understand?}
{151}{}{Okay.}
{152}{}{Hi. I'm still waiting for a final resolution to our troubles. In other words, kick Darion's ass!}
{153}{}{Done.}
{154}{}{You've done it, friend! We're no longer under Darion's yoke. Thank you! I'm ready to accept your deal with NCR now.
 Just have them send one of their reps by and I'll seal the deal.}
{155}{}{Done.}
{156}{}{Thanks for the chance of a new life. We all owe you.}
{157}{}{Just go away. I have nothing to say to you.}
{158}{}{Wait, before you go... I found this key card some time ago, and I have no idea what it's for.
 Rebecca says that you found some sort of entrance where they were holding Chrissy. Maybe this card will
 open it. Here, take it.}
{159}{}{Thanks.}
{160}{}{What can I help you with?}
{161}{}{Just the problems with the NCR, but I think the deal you offered will solve that.}
{162}{}{You've done it, friend! We're no longer under Darion's yoke. Thank you!}

{163}{}{Now that Darion's gone we don't have any way to get food. We will surely perish! Thanks a lot.}
