{104}{}{'Roger that, I've got you on the scope' -- sorry, but I'm in the middle of something right now.}
{105}{}{I can't talk right now.}
{106}{}{Feel free to look, but don't touch.}

{107}{}{Are you nuts to walk around here out of uniform? Get suited up!}
{108}{}{If the sergeant catches you out of uniform, he'll hand you your ass.}
{109}{}{Why are you out of uniform? }

{110}{}{Holy shit! We're being invaded! Alert!}
{111}{}{Intruders! Call the guard!}
{112}{}{Guard! Intruders in air traffic control!}

{113}{}{What's up? Are we under attack?}
