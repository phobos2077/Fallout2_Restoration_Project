# 20.  CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT NEW RENO? (19)
{515}{}{Can Jules TELL you 'bout New Reno? Hell, yes! FIRST thing you should know: Reno's ruled by four families: Mordinos,
 the Salvatores, the Bishops and the Wrights. Each o' them got a slice of th' Reno pie.}
{516}{}{Reno's got four families: Mordinos, Salvatores, Bishops, Wrights. Each o' them got a slice of th' Reno pie.}
{517}{}{Tell me about the families.}
{518}{}{What about the law?}
{519}{}{Actually, I had some other questions...}
{520}{}{Interesting. Thanks for talking with me.}

# 21. LAW (20)
{525}{}{Ain't no law, ain't no po-lice, ain't no sheriff, ain't no government body. JUST the families.}
{527}{}{Who keeps order in Reno then?}
{528}{}{I see. I had some other questions...}

# 22. ORDER? (21)
{535}{}{The Families keep things running smooth. They don't LIKE trouble in Reno 'cause it hurts the tourist trade, and that
 means less money for them. Don't make trouble and cover yer bets, you'll stay off Golgotha.}
{537}{}{Golgotha?}

# 23. GOLGOTHA? (22)
{545}{}{Yeah, this graveyard outside o' town. It's where they put debtors and people who've crossed the families.
 They just string 'em up on posts and let 'em die slowly in the sun. Not my choice a' dying. Stinks like hell out there.}
{547}{}{Interesting. Say, I had some other questions...}
{548}{}{Sounds great. Thanks for the information.}

# 24. INFO'S EXPENSIVE (20-23, 26-53)
{555}{}{Well, now, ANOTHER thing you gotta know about New Reno is nothin's free. If it is, ex-amine the merchandise.}
{556}{}{Well, now, that kind of info don't come cheap. You got the chips? Then you got my attention.}
{557}{}{Pay him 25 chips.}
{558}{}{Pay him 50 chips.}
{559}{}{Pay him 75 chips.}
{560}{}{Pay him 100 chips.}
{561}{}{Actually, I had some other... non-family... related questions.}
{562}{}{Looks like I can't afford any information right now. I'll be back when I have some chips.}
{563}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tip, Jules.}

# 25. TELL ME ABOUT SOME MORE ABOUT THE FAMILIES (24)
{575}{}{(Jules pockets the chips so quickly, you swear they vanished.) So... which of the fine families interests you today?}
{576}{}{(Jules pockets the chips.) So... which family you got the need to know about?}
{577}{}{Tell me about the Mordino Family.}
{578}{}{Tell me about the Salvatore Family.}
{579}{}{Tell me about the Bishop Family.}
{580}{}{Tell me about the Wright Family.}
{581}{}{I had some questions about New Reno...}
{582}{}{Actually, nevermind. We'll talk some other time.}

# 26.  TELL ME ABOUT MORDINOS 1 (25)
{590}{}{(Holds up two fingers.) The Mordinos are a two-headed beast, friend, an' each head's named Jesus Mordino.}
{591}{}{Go on...}
{592}{}{I always suspected Jesus had ties to organized crime.}
{594}{}{Let's go back to the other families.}
{596}{}{Actually, nevermind. Thanks for talking with me.}

# 27.  TELL ME ABOUT MORDINOS 2 (26)
{615}{}{There's the father, Big Jesus Mordino, and the son, Lil' Jesus, and both are the meanest sons of bitches you ever met.
 Used to be slaves here, but they turned the tables years ago and carved out their own lil' empire.}
{616}{}{How big is their "empire?"}

# 28.  TELL ME ABOUT MORDINOS 3 (27)
{625}{}{They own the Desperado just down the street. Can't miss it. They also got the biggest supply of Jet in ALL o' New Reno.
 So if you got the urge to fly...}
{626}{}{Speaking of which, do you know where can I get some drugs around here?}
{627}{}{How come the Mordinos have the biggest supply of Jet?}
{628}{}{Tell me about the other families.}

# 29.  HOW COME MORDINOS HAVE BIGGEST SUPPLY OF JET? (28, 29, 31, 32, 33)
{635}{}{They're on top of the pile, friend. Ain't no more reason than that. They got the factory, the maker, and the
 distribution. They're like a whole goddamn airline they got so much Jet.}
{636}{}{Yeah, what about it?}
{637}{}{What factory?}
{638}{}{What "maker?"}
{639}{}{How extensive is their distribution network?}

# 30. WHAT FACTORY? (29)
{650}{}{Got factories all over New Reno, cranking out the shit day and night. That's why you can buy all
 the Jet you need most anywhere: bars, casinos, on th' street... and a-course, from ME.}
{651}{}{Can I see what you got in stock?}
{652}{}{Back to the Mordinos and Jet...}

# 31. MAKER? (29)
{660}{}{Yeah... (Leans in.) ...see, the Mordinos got themselves a lil' gold mine by the name o' Myron. Hit the jackpot with him... see,
 he MADE Jet.}
{662}{}{Enough about the Mordinos and the families for now. Tell me about this Myron...}

# 32. DISTRIBUTION? (29)
{670}{}{They pump it all over New Reno, for starters. Up north to the Den, and also... uh... (Catches himself, then shrugs and continues.)
 ... well, it's also makin' it's way to Redding nowadays, too, which don't hurt the Mordinos purse none.}
{672}{}{Tell me about Redding.}

# 33. REDDING? (32)
{685}{}{Not much TO say. Mining town northwest o' here. Word is, Mordino wants to get some influence there, get some of
 that Redding GOLD they dig up. So he ships them Jet, they ship back gold, everybody happy.}

# 34.  TELL ME ABOUT SALVATORES (25)
{695}{}{Quiet bunch. They're led by Louis Salvatore, an original gangster gettin' on in years. Their territory's on the West Side;
 their crib's this bar called Salvatore's on 2nd Street. Don't be making trouble there.}
{696}{}{Why not?}

# 35.  WHY NOT? (34)
{710}{}{Some free advice: You see a Salvatore, keep your head down n' mouth shut, or they'll cut you in two. They got the best
 firepower this side of Cee-Ay, so nobody with any kinda sense fucks with them, understand?}
{711}{}{What kind of "firepower" do the Salvatores have?}
{712}{}{Sounds like they got some pretty heavy shit. What are they packing?}
{715}{}{Interesting... thanks for the warning.}

# 36.  WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS TO THE SALVATORES HAVE? (35)
{725}{}{Pistols...'cept they shoot LIGHT. Now, Reno's a city o' lights, but the light THOSE pistols shine can cut a man in
 two... *swuppp*... (Jules makes slicing motion.) Makes a clean burn 'tween the two halves, it does.}
{726}{}{They shoot light? Do they call the pistols 'laser pistols?'}
{727}{}{I'll be sure to be careful, then. Can you tell me about the other families?}

# 37.  WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS TO THE SALVATORES HAVE? (36)
{735}{}{Well, uh, I don't really know... I ain't sure what you're talking about. But take my word for it: don't go asking
 the Salvatores about those pistols. They have this twitchy habit a killing people who're curious.}
{736}{}{By 'laser pistols,' Jules, I mean pistols that emit beams of coherent light. A beam of sufficient wattage - say, several
 megawatts - could do considerable damage if focused on a target for a few seconds, producing the effect you've described.}
{737}{}{Did they always have these pistols?}

# 38.  WHERE ARE THEY COMIN' FROM (37)
{750}{}{They didn't always have 'em... else they'd be in charge o' New Reno... ALL of New Reno. As it stands, they're just
 building up quietly. Those pistols showed up... maybe a few months back, 'round the time o' the massacre.}
{751}{}{Massacre?}

# 39.  MASSACRE? (38)
{765}{}{Oh, yeah... two Salvatore boys with those pistols killed a buncha Bishop's men, then shot down some of Mordino's boys who'd
 been tryin' to muscle in on the West Side. Since then, the other families steered clear of the Salvatores.}
{766}{}{Definitely sounds like lasers. Do you know how the Salvatores power their laser pistols? Do they employ battery packs,
 fusion cells, or cabled power systems of any kind?}
{767}{}{Any idea where they're getting these pistols from?}

# 40.  ANY IDEA WHERE THEY GET THE LASER WEAPONS? (39)
{780}{}{No idea, friend, I ain't asking, and you shouldn't neither... take my advice. You looking for weapons, there's
 other... safer... places you can try.}
{781}{}{Like where?}
{782}{}{Tell me some more about the families.}

# 41.  BY LASER PISTOLS I MEAN (37, 39)
{795}{}{Uh... now, I  don't know 'bout that, and... hmmmm. Y'know, you talk like one of them whitecoats over at the Stables. Y'sure you ain't
 one of them?}
{796}{}{Stables?}

# 42.  STABLES? (41)
{810}{}{(Leans in.) Now, I don't want to go on 'bout the less PLEASANT New Reno sites, but there's a buncha whitecoats
 who talk like you in this building, the Stables, north o' town. Heavily guarded by Mordino's men.}
{811}{}{What do they do there?}

# 43.  WHAT DO THEY DO? (42)
{825}{}{Test new kinds o' Jet, from what I hear. Now, I'm telling you this in CONFIDENCE, friend: don't go poking around
 there... the Mordinos don't like visitors. 'Sides... Jules can get you all the Jet you need.}
{826}{}{Why do the Mordinos keep testing Jet? It sounds like it's addictive enough as it is.}
{827}{}{Who do the Mordinos test the drugs on?}
{828}{}{Do you know how I can get into the Stables?}

# 44.  WHO DO THEY TEST IT ON? (43, 45, 46, 47)
{840}{}{Slaves, pretty much. Keep 'em in stalls in the stables, like brahmin. }
{841}{}{Mordinos buy a bunch from slavers that pass through. }
{842}{}{Mordinos buy a bunch from slavers like you that pass through New Reno. }
{843}{}{They buy a helluva lot, too, cause the slaves keep getting sick, running away... or die. Mostly die.}

# 45.  WHY DO THEY KEEP TESTING JET? (43, 44, 46, 47)
{860}{}{Just to make it better, I guess, refine the process, refine the drug. Jet's good, but if they can make it even
 BETTER... difference between scraping the sky and flying to the moon, I s'pose.}

# 46.  ANY IDEA HOW I CAN GET IN THERE? (44, 45)
{880}{}{Now hold on a minute -- I wouldn't even THINK about that if I were you, friend. The Mordinos guard that place like
 rabid dogs. Just put the thought outta your mind.}
{881}{}{There must be a way in...}
{886}{}{All right, nevermind then. Thanks for the information.}

# 47.  THERE MUST BE A WAY IN . . . (46)
{895}{}{Well... if you can talk all smart like you were doing, you could pass for one of the whitecoats there.
 'Course, you could also hire on with the Mordinos and get put there...}

# 48.  TELL ME ABOUT BISHOP (25)
{910}{}{Ha! John Bishop? Not much to say: Bishop's a smart one, tough, and he's looking to get it ALL.}
{911}{}{Yeah, well, he'll have to fight me for it. Where is this jerk-off's territory?}
{912}{}{Where's his territory?}

# 49.  TELL ME ABOUT BISHOP (48)
{925}{}{He hangs out at the Shark Club up on 2nd Street. He's surrounded by guards, so don't go paying a visit unless you got REAL
 business with him. (Smiles evily.) And keep yer business away from his wife. AND his daughter.}
{926}{}{Uh, business?}
{927}{}{No danger of that.}

# 50.  BID-NESS (49)
{935}{}{You know what I mean, brother. Just stay away from them two, 'less the thought of bein' on Bishop's list is somethin'
 you like.}
{936}{}{Well, maybe so, but WHAT you got 'tween your legs don't matter... to Missus Bishop, at least. She swings like a saloon door.}
{937}{}{Uh, tell me some more about the families.}

# 51.  TELL ME ABOUT WRIGHT (25)
{945}{}{The Wrights? Heh. The Wrights are the only family who ARE family. The other families, see, they got mercs
 and tumbleweeds for muscle, but the Wright family IS the Wright family, understand?}
{946}{}{Got a warning for you where the Wrights are concerned, slaver... see, the Wrights are the only family who ARE family.}
{947}{}{They're family? How many are there?}

# 52.  TELL ME ABOUT WRIGHT 2 (51)
{960}{}{Almost twenty or more true-blooded Wrights. Mean as spit and each of them uglier than the next.}
{961}{}{Almost twenty or more true-blooded Wrights, and they don't take kindly to people in your line of work. Word is, they
 lost a sister way back when to a slaver, and they ain't liked slavers ever since.}
{962}{}{What do the Wrights control in New Reno?}

# 53.  WHAT DO WRIGHTS CONTROL? (52)
{975}{}{They ain't got no casino, they mostly deal in alcohol and sell it to the other families. So if you're looking
 for hootch... they hang out in the east side o' town in a big mansion.}

# 54.  WHERE CAN I GET SOME DRUGS? (19, 28)
{985}{}{Brother, you need look no farther than humble Jules himself. }
{986}{}{Sister, you need look no farther than humble Jules himself. }
{987}{}{My sweet sister, you need look no farther than humble Jules himself. }
{988}{}{I got it ALL, and if I ain't got it, you don't want it. Shall we get down to bizness?}
{989}{}{Sure. Let's deal.}
{990}{}{What kind of drugs can I get in New Reno?}
{991}{}{Not right now. I had some other questions...}
{992}{}{Actually, I'm not interested in any drugs right now. I have to be going.}

# 55.  WHAT KIND OF DRUGS CAN I GET IN NEW RENO? (54)
{1005}{}{All KINDS o' shit. I got shit make you horny, make your woman horny, make you hard, make you happy, make you strong,
 make you smart... and, o course, I got THE drug, the shit that'll let you FLY... Jet.}
{1006}{}{All KINDS o' shit. I got shit make you horny, make you wet, dry you out, calm you down, sex you up, make you happy,
 make you strong, make you smart... and, o course, I got THE shit that'll let you FLY... Jet.}
{1008}{}{Where does Jet come from? Has it always been around?}

# 56.  WHERE DOES JET COME FROM? (55)
{1025}{}{Well... uh... Jet comes from here... Reno, I mean. It ain't been around long, but it's in DEMAND, know what I'm saying? (Winks.)
 Number one reason we get tourists like yourself.}
{1026}{}{Well, I'm looking to buy some drugs. Let's deal.}
{1027}{}{But why did Jet come from here?}

# 57.  BUT WHY DOES JET COME FROM HERE? (31, 56)
{1035}{}{Aw, now... see, Family Mordino struck the jackpot one day when they found this little brainiac called Myron. Seems he's a
 natural when it comes to making drugs. He MADE Jet.}
{1036}{}{Myron, huh? Where can I find him?}

# 58.  WHERE CAN I FIND HIM? (57)
{1045}{}{(Leans in.) Now, I don't want to go on 'bout the less PLEASANT New Reno sites, but there's this building, the Stables,
 north o' town. Heavily guarded by the Mordino family. That's where Myron is.}
{1046}{}{Stables outside of town?}

# 59.  WHERE CAN I FIND HIM? (58)
{1055}{}{Yeah, Mordinos keep ol' golden boy there, give him chips, whores, anything he wants, as long as he makes drugs. Jet
 was his FINEST. Ain't seen anything so addictive in a long time. Turned Reno around, it did.}
{1056}{}{Think I could meet this Myron?}

# 60.  THINK I COULD MEET THIS MYRON? = FEMALE (59)
{1065}{}{(Jules stops and studies you, his eyes running up and down your body.)}
{1066}{}{Jules? Hello? I asked if there was any way I could meet Myron.}

# 61.  THINK I COULD MEET THIS MYRON? (59, 60)
{1075}{}{Whoa, now, brother, here's some free advice: don't you go be looking to meet Myron, 'cause the Mordinos catch wind of THAT, they'll gut you and let
 you die on Golgotha.}
{1076}{}{I wouldn't be trying it. If you need Jet, don't go see Myron, cause you can get it from me. Mordinos catch wind of you
 seeing Myron, they'll gut you and let you die on Golgotha.}
{1077}{}{Well, now... YOU might be able to see him. Thing is, the Mordinos catch wind of it, they'll gut you and let you die on
 Golgotha.}
{1078}{}{Isn't there any way I could see him?}
{1079}{}{Why would I be able to see him?}
{1080}{}{Why were you studying me like a sculpture a second ago?}
{1081}{}{Golgotha? What's that?}
{1083}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information.}

# 62. UH, GOLGOTHA? (61, 63, 64)
{1101}{}{Isn't there any way I could see Myron?}
{1102}{}{Why would I be able to see Myron?}
{1103}{}{Why were you studying me like a sculpture a second ago?}

# 63.  WHY WOULD I BE ABLE TO SEE HIM (61, 62)
{1115}{}{I was doing THAT cause I was seein' if you were Myron's type, but you don't look it. Maybe if you cleaned yourself up
 some, Myron'd give you a second glance... see, he likes the womenses. }
{1116}{}{(Leers.) Cause, honey, you look GOOD. And Myron likes women that look GOOD. }
{1117}{}{Boy's like a rabbit, and is ALWAYS looking for a new cabbage patch.}
{1118}{}{What was that about Golgotha?}
{1119}{}{Uh, great. Thanks for the tip, Jules. Say, I had some other questions...}
{1120}{}{Well, on that note, I think I better be going.}
{1121}{}{How eloquent. When you speak, it's poetry - the use of "cabbage patch" brings forth striking imagery. THANK you.}

# 64.  ISN'T THERE ANY WAY I COULD SEE HIM? (61, 62)
{1130}{}{If you were a fine-looking woman, maybe, but otherwise, you would need the Mordinos' permission first. Both ain't
 very likely.}
{1132}{}{I see. Say, I had some other questions...}

# 65.  I'M LOOKING FOR SOME HEAVY FIREPOWER. (19, 40)
{1145}{}{You want weapons, you go see my man Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll kill people you ain't even MET yet.
 Tell him I sent you.}
{1146}{}{I hear you, brother, I hear you. You want the best, you go see my man Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll kill
 people you ain't even MET yet. Tell him I sent you.}
{1147}{}{I hear you, sister, I hear you. You want the best, you go see my man Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll
 kill people you ain't even MET yet. Tell him I sent you.}
{1148}{}{Sweetness, you ALREADY packing some serious shit with that body of yours. Still, if you want more, go see my man
 Eldridge on the West End. He got shit that'll kill people you ain't even MET yet. Tell him I sent you.}
{1150}{}{Thanks for the tip, I think I better be going.}

# 66.  I'M LOOKING FOR SOME SUPPLIES. (19)
{1165}{}{You need some supplies? Well, you CAN go see Renesco up on the West End... but here's the catch: don't buy no drugs
 from him, cause they ain't SAFE. He's got supplies all right, but if you want drugs, talk to me.}
{1166}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Say, I had some more questions...}
{1167}{}{His drugs aren't safe, huh? Well, thanks for the tip, I think I better be going.}

# 67.  I WANT TO GET LAID. (19)
{1175}{}{I hear you, brother. Most TOURISTS, see, they stride down Virgin street and get suckered by some two-chip whore.
 You look like you got class, so head over to the Cat's Paw 'cross the street there. Tell 'em Jules sent you.}
{1176}{}{I hear you, sister. Most TOURISTS, see, they stride down Virgin street and get suckered by some glitterboy.
 You look like you got class, so head over to the Cat's Paw 'cross the street there. Tell 'em Jules sent you.}
{1177}{}{(Smiles, holds out arms.) Look no farther, my sweet sister. Jules is at your command!}
{1178}{}{Uh, thanks, Jules, but no. Say, I had some more questions...}
{1180}{}{Well, thanks for the tip. I think I better be going.}
{1181}{}{Well, uh, thanks anyway, but I think I better be going.}

# 68.  VAULT 13. (19)
{1190}{}{You mean Vault CITY, don't you? That's to the northeast. Can't miss it, all the caravan trails lead right to it.}
{1191}{}{All right. Say, I had some more questions...}
{1192}{}{Well, thanks for the tip. I better be going.}

# 69.  GECK (19)
{1200}{}{Garden of wha-? That some kind of drug? What does this "Garden thing" do? Get you high?}
{1201}{}{No, it's... well, nevermind. I had some other questions...}
{1202}{}{Nevermind. I really better be going.}

# 70.  MY TRIBE (19)
{1210}{}{Don't know nothing about that. Sorry about your loss. Maybe it was slavers?}
{1211}{}{Could be. I had some other questions...}

# 71.  TANKER (19)
{1220}{}{A what?}
{1221}{}{Forget it. I had some other questions...}

# 72.  RICHARD WRIGHT (17)
{1230}{}{Uh... Wright kid? Yeah, I heard about that. A damn shame. Kids his age shouldn't be doing drugs. They got so much
 to live for without being given impure shit.}
{1231}{}{Speaking of impure shit, Renesco said you sell Jet laced with arsenic.}
{1232}{}{What do you mean, "impure shit?"}
{1233}{}{You know anything about this empty Jet canister?}
{1234}{}{Interesting you should say that... I don't think he overdosed on Jet. I think he was poisoned.}

# 73.  IMPURE SHIT (85)
{1250}{}{(Shrugs.) Some dealers don't care what they sell, and people die. Now I ain't saying nothing, but I'd check with ol'
 Renesco the Rocketman and see how good his shit is.}
{1251}{}{I did check with Renesco... he said you sell Jet laced with arsenic.}
{1252}{}{Reno's a big place, Jules. Anybody else who might be responsible?}
{1253}{}{I had some other questions...}
{1254}{}{All right. I'll check him out.}

# 74.  DEALERS (73)
{1270}{}{Lotta dealers in town... Lil' Jesus Mordino, maybe, but why he would sell to a Wright don't make sense. There's Jagged
 Jimmy J up on 2nd Street, north of here, but he's small time. I'd still check with Renesco, though.}
{1272}{}{"Jagged Jimmy J?" Who's that?}
{1273}{}{Lil' Jesus Mordino? Where can I find him?}
{1274}{}{Maybe I will. Say, I had some other questions...}
{1275}{}{Lil' Jesus... Jagged Jimmy J... Renesco. Got it. Thanks.}

# 75.  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? (17)
{1290}{}{(Jules' smile dies.) I'm lookin' for people like you comin' into Reno. This is the prime spot to deal. Plus, certain
 establishments pay me to point newcomers their way. THAT a good enough answer for you?}
{1291}{}{Yes. Now I need the answer to some other questions...}
{1292}{}{Just curious. Thanks for the honesty.}

# 76.  CAR STOLEN (ACT INNOCENT) (17)
{1305}{}{Your CAR? You sure you parked it here? I ain't seen it.}
{1306}{}{What, you suddenly gone BLIND? You see my FIST, mother fucker? You SEE it?!! Now tell me again you haven't seen my
 car... I fucking DARE you.}
{1307}{}{Jules, if you don't tell me what happened to my car, I'll tell Family Wright YOU sold their son the Jet that
 killed him. You'll be dead within the hour. Talk.}
{1308}{}{You SURE you haven't seen it, Jules?}
{1309}{}{Yes, I'm SURE I parked it here. Any idea where it might be?}
{1310}{}{All right then. I had some other questions...}
{1311}{}{I better go look for it.}

# 77.  YOU SURE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT? (76)
{1320}{}{Naw, brother, I ain't seen it. }
{1321}{}{Naw, sister, I ain't seen it. }
{1322}{}{I'll keep an eye out for it, though. (Shrugs.) Still, Reno's a big place...}
{1323}{}{Jules, I have this crazy HUNCH you know where my car went. If you don't tell me where it is, I'll use you for
 target practice. Now talk.}
{1324}{}{Thanks anyway. I had some other questions...}

# 78.  CAR STOLEN (CAUGHT) (76, 77)
{1340}{}{Sister, I don't know NOTHING about your car. }
{1341}{}{Brother, I don't know NOTHING about your car. }
{1342}{}{I AIN'T seen what happened to it, and I DON'T know where it is. }
{1343}{}{(He throws a hateful glance at Cody across the street.)}
{1344}{}{Really? That sounds like a load of SHIT to me.}
{1345}{}{That so? I KNOW you did something with it, so you better tell me where it is before I do something to YOU.}
{1346}{}{Nevermind then. I'll keep looking for it.}

# 79.  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT (78)
{1360}{}{All right, brother, all right! }
{1361}{}{All right, sister, all right! }
{1362}{}{...I seen some guys take the car not long ago. But there were too many of them for me to stop, y'know, and --}
{1363}{}{Shut up and take me where they went. Now.}
{1364}{}{Nevermind. I'll look for them without your help.}

# 80.  FOLLOW HIM (79)
{1375}{}{Okay, okay...}
{1376}{}{By the way... Jules? If you so much as GLANCE the wrong way at that kid across the street, I'll come back and kill
 you so many times you'll need multiple wills. Understand? Now lead on.}
{1377}{}{One more thing, Jules: I even so much as hear that you were messing with Cody, I'll kill you. Now take me to
 where my car is.}
{1378}{}{(Follow him.)}

# 81. INTRO, CODY = DEAD (WTG)
{1385}{}{H... hey. (Smiles uneasily. His cologne slams into you like a wave.) Name's Jules. What you need, my friend, huh? A..anything?}
{1386}{}{H... hey. Hey, welcome back! (Smiles uneasily. His cologne slams into you like a wave.) What you need from Jules, my
 friend, huh? A..anything?}
{1389}{}{I had some questions...}
{1390}{}{Nice cologne, Jules. I smelled it all over Cody's body. You're dead.}
{1391}{}{Cody's dead, Jules. I'm betting you were responsible. You're dead.}

# 82.  RUN (81)
{1405}{}{H-hey, I WISH I could help, but I don't know nothin'...look, I gotta go.}
{1406}{}{Nice cologne, Jules. I smelled it all over Cody's body. You're fucking dead.}
{1407}{}{Cody's dead, Jules. I'm betting you were responsible. You're fucking dead.}
{1408}{}{See you, Jules.}

# 83.  JJJ? (74, 84)
{1415}{}{He's this dumb sonuvabitch who thinks he's a big-time dealer. You can't miss him... his face is all scarred up.
 The fool was flying on Jet one night and tried to shave with a combat knife. Sad part is, it didn't KILL 'im.}
{1416}{}{And Lil' Jesus Mordino? Where can I find him?}
{1417}{}{Lotta love in this town... say, I had some other questions...}

# 84.  LIL' JESUS? (74, 83)
{1425}{}{Well, friend, I'd be careful about just walkin' in and accusing Lil' Jesus of anything. But if you REALLY want to
 talk with him, I ain't gonna stop you. He hangs out at the Desperado 'cross the street there.}
{1426}{}{And "Jagged Jimmy J?" Who's that?}
{1427}{}{Say, I had some other questions...}

# 85.  POISONED (72)
{1435}{}{Doesn't surprise me... that sort of thing seems to happen a LOT in this town.}
{1436}{}{What do you mean by that?}
{1437}{}{What can you tell me about this empty Jet canister?}
{1439}{}{I see. Well, thanks for your time.}

# 86.  JET CANISTER (85, 72)
{1450}{}{(Glances at it.) Like a hundred others I've seen. It ain't mine, though... could be Jagged Jimmy J's or Renesco's.}
{1451}{}{Jagged Jimmy J?}
{1452}{}{Renesco?}
{1453}{}{Hmmm. I had some other questions...}

# 87.  JJJ 2? (86)
{1470}{}{He's this dumb sonuvabitch up on 2nd Street, north of here. You can't miss him... his face is all scarred up. The
 fool was flying on Jet one night and tried to shave with a combat knife. Sad part is, it didn't KILL 'im.}
{1471}{}{And Renesco? Where can I find him?}
{1473}{}{Got it. Thanks.}

# 88.  RENESCO? (86, 87)
{1485}{}{He's this old cracker who runs a pharmacy on Commercial Row... go up a few streets north, make a left where Salvatore's
 and the Bishop casino meet, then keep heading down that street. It's on the right.}
{1486}{}{And "Jagged Jimmy J?" Where can I find him?}
{1487}{}{All right... say, I had some other questions...}

# 89.  ARSENIC? (72, 73, 74)
{1500}{}{You tell that bitch he keeps talking shit like that, an' I'LL kill 'im before old man Wright does. You know what kind
 of talk that is? That's talk from a man who's SCARED, that's what it is.}
