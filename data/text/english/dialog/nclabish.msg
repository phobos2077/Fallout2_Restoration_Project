# 11. BISHOP (10, 16)
{270}{}{My husband? That is simple. He is deceased. SUCH a tragedy. I'm still recovering from all the
 champagne I drunk when I heard.}
{271}{}{My husband? He is the head of the Bishop family. In matters of diplomacy, business, and criminal
 pursuits, he possesses a certain animal cunning that one cannot help but admire, however contemptible
 his other qualities.}
{272}{}{Yes, his tactic of hiring those 'raiders' to lean on Vault City seems to be pretty effective.}
{273}{}{Other qualities?}
{275}{}{Sorry I asked. I better be going.}
{276}{}{Sorry, Mrs. Bishop. I didn't mean to pry. I'll leave.}

# 12. OTHER QUALITIES (11)

{281}{}{Actually, I had some other questions...}

# 13. TELL ME ABOUT THE BISHOP FAMILY (10, 16)
{285}{}{There really is nothing to say about the Bishop 'Family.' Oh... there is the extended family
 of hired thugs, mercenaries, whores, pushers, and slaves, but that is really all that the Bishop 'family'
 amounts to.}
{286}{}{It sounds as if your marriage life isn't as healthy as it could be.}

# 15. DAUGHTER? (14)
{305}{}{Yes, the Angela you *slept* with. Surely you remember? (She gives you a withering look.) I *hope* you
 used a prophylactic. Her hormones are so out of control that even the mere mention of sperm would make her
 pregnant.}
{306}{}{Yes, my daughter, Angela. She has become quite the little tramp. (Smiles ruefully.) Like mother, like
 daughter...(Sighs in irritation.) Now, is that *all?*}
{308}{}{Uh, proph... proph-o-lak...? Uh, well, I think we did use one... whatever it is. You know what? I think
 I'm going to go check right now.}

{321}{}{Nothing, thanks. I really must be going.}

# 17. [CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I COULD FIND THE GECK?] (9, 10)
{325}{}{I know where you could find *a* Creation Kit... but it will do you little good. It has
 already been used.}
{326}{}{Where is this Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{328}{}{Then it's no use to me... thanks anyway.}

# 18. WHERE IS IT? (17)
{330}{}{(Smiles faintly, as if remembering something pleasant.) Have you ever been to Vault City?
 It is northeast of New Reno. They had such a kit... once, long ago, but they used it when they left
 their Vault for the surface.}
{331}{}{Can you tell me about Vault City?}
{332}{}{Can I ask you some other questions?}
{333}{}{I'll go check out Vault City then. Thanks for the information.}

# 19. VAULT CITY (18)
{335}{}{(Her smile fades, and her expression becomes hard and distant.) There is not much to tell.
 I think you'll find the climate there... different. Now, is that all?}
{336}{}{No, actually, I had some other questions...}
{337}{}{Yes, it is. Sorry to bother you.}

# 20. [HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF VAULT 13?] (9, 10, 16)
{340}{}{As I said, there is Vault City to the northeast. Is that the place you are referring to?}
{341}{}{I know of Vault *City* to the northeast. Is that the place you are referring to?}
{342}{}{No. Wrong place.}
{343}{}{It could be.}
{345}{}{Might be... I'll go check it out. Thanks.}

# 21. [NO. WRONG PLACE.] (20)
{350}{}{Hmnnn. Well then, I'm afraid that I can't help you.}

{353}{}{Yeah, well... thanks anyway.}
{354}{}{Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Bishop. I appreciate it.}

# 22. [IT COULD BE.] (20)
{360}{}{You might want to head there, then.}
{362}{}{All right then, I'll go check it out.}
{363}{}{Very well, thanks for your time. I appreciate it.}

# 23. [DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO MIGHT KNOW?] (21)
{370}{}{Dear boy... }
{371}{}{Dear girl... }
{372}{}{the people of Reno have enough difficulty remembering which whore they left their
 cocks in when they wake in the morning, much less know where to find anything such as what

{374}{}{All right... I was just asking. Later, then.}
{375}{}{Very well. Thanks for your time.}

# 24. [VERY WELL. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. I WILL BE GOING. NAME TRUE] (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 34, 35, 36, 38)
{380}{}{Hold on a moment. (Studies you.) You seem to be... new in town. Would you care to join
 me for a drink in my chambers? We can discuss New Reno; it's a dangerous place to those
 unfamiliar with its ways.}
{381}{}{A moment before you leave. (She studies you again.) Do you have the time for that
 drink now? Or must you dash off again?}
{382}{}{Only if the drinks are just the beginning.}
{383}{}{Sure. A drink would be welcome.}
{384}{}{I'm sorry, Mrs. Bishop, but I'm married.}
{385}{}{No, thanks. I really have to go.}
{386}{}{No way. I don't want to make your husband... upset.}
{387}{}{I work for your husband, Mrs. Bishop. It wouldn't be right.}

# 25. [ONLY IF THIS IS A LEAD-IN TO SOME SORT OF SWEATY SEXUAL ACTIVITY.] (24)
{390}{}{(She raises an eyebrow.) We shall see.}
{391}{}{Well, that's all I need to hear. Let's go.}
{392}{}{Mrs. Bishop, I'm sorry, but I have to decline... this time.}
{393}{}{I'm sorry, but I can't, Mrs. Bishop. I really have to be going.}
{394}{}{No way. I have no desire to cross your husband.}

# 26. [NO WAY. I HAVE NO DESIRE TO CROSS YOUR HUSBAND.] (24, 25)
{400}{}{(She laughs.) You flatter yourself. It's merely a drink. }
{401}{}{And IF anything were to happen, I assure you, my husband is QUITE dead. }
{402}{}{And IF anything were to happen, I assure you, my husband is NOT the jealous type. }

# 27. [MRS. BISHOP, I'M VERY FLATTERED, BUT I HAVE TO SAY NO.] (24, 25, 26, 33)
{410}{}{(She raises an eyebrow.) My husband may be dead, but his men are at my disposal.
 They can become quite... irate... when an invitation from Mrs. Bishop is refused. Are you
 *quite* certain you will not join me?}
{411}{}{(She raises an eyebrow.) My husband is not the jealous type, but he can become
 quite... irate... when a gracious invitation from a Bishop family member is refused. Are you
 *quite* certain you will not join me?}
{412}{}{I still have to say no.}
{413}{}{Okay. Just a drink, then.}
{414}{}{Look, I have to go, Mrs. Bishop.}

# 28. [I STILL HAVE TO SAY NO.] (27)
{415}{}{(She frowns.) Leave then. If we cross paths again, rest assured that I will not
 be the least bit interested in talking to you.}

 something I can do for you?}

{437}{}{I'd like to join you for another... drink, if you have the time, Mrs. Bishop.}
{438}{}{I had some questions...}
{439}{}{Not at the moment, thanks. I have to go.}

# 33. I'M MARRIED (24)
{440}{}{So? So am I. What are you suggesting that my invitation is? Some sort of prelude
 to adultery? Come now, don't be foolish. Now, are you coming?}
{441}{}{Okay, then. Just a drink.}
{443}{}{I'm sorry, but I can't, Mrs. Bishop. I really have to go.}

# 34. RAIDERS (11, 13)
{445}{}{Oh, yes... my husband's well thought-out attempt at forcing others to accept his
 gesture of good will. I had rather hoped those raiders had been incinerated by Vault
 City's laser cannons.}
{446}{}{"Gesture of good will?"}
{447}{}{I see. I had some other questions...}
{448}{}{Interesting... well, thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{449}{}{Hmmm... interesting. Thanks for your time, Mrs. Bishop.}

# 35. GESTURE OF GOOD WILL (34)
{450}{}{Yes. His initial offer of an alliance were refused, so he reiterated his peaceful
 intentions by using violence to drive Vault City into submission... through an intermediary,
 of course.}
{451}{}{Well, I was wondering about that. Wouldn't Vault City turn to someone else for help
 rather than agree to join with Bishop?}
{452}{}{Well, I was wondering about that. Wouldn't Vault City turn to someone else for
 help... like NCR... rather than agree to join with Bishop?}
{453}{}{Do you have any proof of this?}

# 36. GESTURE OF GOOD WILL (35)
{460}{}{(She smirks.) Well, aren't *you* a sharp one...}
{461}{}{So? Do you know what Bishop has planned?}
{462}{}{Well, sometimes... depending on who you ask. I had some other questions...}

# 38. COURIERS (35, 36)
{470}{}{(Frowns.) No. Should I? (Studies you carefully, then smirks.) }
{471}{}{(Frowns.) No. Should I? (Studies you carefully, then smirks again.) }
{472}{}{You certainly do ask a lot of dangerous questions about my husband's business.
 I'd be *very* careful if I were you.}

{645}{}{(Rolls over.) John sent some mercenaries East, near Vault City to 'lean'
 on the city. Wants to try and apply pressure on 'em, make them beg NCR for help.}
{646}{}{Beg *NCR* for help? Why?}

# 138. WHY RAIDERS? (137)
{650}{}{Mmmmm... oh... well... (Turns over.) John promised NCR he'd give Vault City to them.
 So he sent out some of his men, told them to act like raiders until Vault City caved.}
{651}{}{Do you know where these raiders are?}
{652}{}{Uh... is there any PROOF of this anywhere?}

# 139. WHERE RAIDERS (138, 163)
{655}{}{No... John probably has a map of their location somewhere around here...
 (Sniffs slightly, rubs nose.) Mmmmm....}
{657}{}{Let's talk about something else...}

# 140. COMBO SAFE (134, 135, 159)
{660}{}{, I think... something like that...}
{663}{}{Excellent... time to go crack a safe... sleep well, Mrs. Bishop.}

# 141. END (140)
{665}{}{Oh, }
{1665}{}{... (Mrs. Bishop... Leslie... turns over and raises herself on her elbows.)
 His safe is trapped. So be careful, all right? You are no good to me with no
 fingers. (Smiles, rolls back over.)}
{666}{}{Oh. Thanks.}

# 142. DAUGHTER? (132)
{670}{}{(Frowns.) What *about* her? }
{671}{}{If you're going to talk about the two of you fornicating, I *don't* want
 to hear it. For your sake, I hope you used a condom. }
{672}{}{Little tramp'll sleep with any tribal that shakes his peace pipe at her...}
{673}{}{Uh... well... let's talk about something else...}

# 143. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY? (132)
{675}{}{(Shrugs slightly.) Nothing to say. Bunch of hired thugs, mercenaries,
 whores, pushers, and slaves...(Rolls over.) ...that's the Bishop 'family.' Wish
 I'd never hooked up with John...}
{677}{}{Hmmmm. I had some other questions...}

# 144. MARRIAGE (143)
{680}{}{And yours is? Hmmmph. }
{681}{}{No, my 'marriage' was not a healthy one. My late husband was in the business
 of accumulating power, and that seldom leaves any room for... anything else.}
{682}{}{No, my 'marriage' is not a healthy one. My husband is in the business of power,
 and that seldom leaves any room for... anything else.}
{683}{}{You sound unhappy. You should leave here, go somewhere else.}
{684}{}{Hmmm. I had some other questions...}

# 145. WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE? (144)
{690}{}{Why, what a BRILLIANT idea! And where would I go? Into the Wastes to live
 amongst the savages? South, to NCR? Northwest, to Redding, to rent my body to miners?}
{691}{}{Why is leaving Reno so impossible? You're not a stupid woman. I would think
 that you could pick up any trade you put your mind to.}
{692}{}{Nevermind then. Look, I had some other questions...}

# 146. WHY IMPOSSIBLE? (145)
{700}{}{I leave, and my husband will bring me back. The Family watches out for their
 own, whether they want to be watched or not.}
{701}{}{Hmmm. Perhaps I will... now that John had his much-deserved accident.
 (Smiles ruefully.) Maybe I will at that. Reno has become... tiresome. (Thinks.)
 Or maybe it just needs new management...}
{702}{}{Say, I had some other questions...}

# 147. WANT ME TO KILL HIM? (135)
{705}{}{No. (She rolls over, mumbles in her sleep.) Don't be an idiot. Soon as people
 find out, you'll be on the run for the rest of your short life.}
{706}{}{But what if people didn't know it was me?}

# 148. ACCIDENT (147)
{710}{}{(She stirs, blinks.) What are you TALKING about? Don't talk foolish.}
{711}{}{I don't know, maybe a trap? Or something that looks like an accident?}
{712}{}{All right. Look, I had some other questions...}

# 149. ACCIDENT (148)
{715}{}{(Her eyes snap open.) His safe... he has explosives set up to it if it's tampered
 with. Only if you enter a certain combination is it safe. Of course, if that combination
 was changed... "fixed"... without his knowledge...}
{716}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe if I "repaired" the lock on his safe... It's something to keep in mind.
 Say, I had some other questions...}

# 150. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? (132)
{720}{}{No, I *don't* talk like everyone around here. It's called an 'education.' (She
 rolls over.) Go to sleep.}
{721}{}{Where could I get an education?}

# 151. EDUCATION? (150)
{725}{}{*Yawn*... You're already as smart as I want you to be... now go to sleep. If you're
 pumping me for information, then you're creating a deficit.}
{726}{}{Deficit? Here in the bed? I did not!}

# 152. VAULT CITY? (132)
{730}{}{(Cracks open one eye.) Who told you that?}
{731}{}{I guessed after I heard you talk about Vault City. You got this nostalgic look
 in your eye.}

# 153. VAULT CITY? (152)
{735}{}{(Her expression crumbles for a moment, then she rolls over so you can't see her.)
 Don't mention that place.}
{736}{}{What happened?}

# 154. WHAT HAPPENED (153)
{740}{}{JOHN happened. I used to live there. He visited once, I was pleasantly charmed because he was so... rough, I guess. Different from most Vault Citizens. Of course, he let me try some drugs and... (Sighs.)}
{741}{}{And?}

# 155. EDUCATION: VAULT CITY (161)
{745}{}{They had memory enhancers for the Pip-Boys there. Had dictionaries
 and encyclopedias stored on them. Took one of the lingual enhancers when I left, though I don't know why.}
{746}{}{Where is this enhancer?}

# 156. SORT OF (155)
{750}{}{*Yawn*... (Curls up.) It's in my safe. Not much use without a Pip-Boy, though.
 Don't know why I still keep it.}
{751}{}{Can I have it?}
{752}{}{Hmmmnn. I had some other questions...}

# 157. SORT OF (156)
{760}{}{(Shrugs.) Sure, if you want them. Combination is }
{1760}{}{. The enhancer is in a compartment in the bottom of the safe... a thief isn't
 going to find it unless they know what to look for.}
{761}{}{How do I use it?}
{762}{}{Thanks. Say, I had some other questions...}

# 158. EXIT (131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163)
{770}{}{(Mrs. Bishop rolls over and closes her eyes. In a few seconds, she's asleep.)}
{771}{}{Quietly slip out of bed and get dressed.}

# 159. BISHOP (134)
{780}{}{The only 'love' we have consists of his forcing his way into my bedroom and
 mounting me like a drunken brahmin. And that is perhaps his least contemptible
 quality, considering his other pursuits.}
{781}{}{Other pursuits?}

# 160. NCR (136)
{790}{}{He also probably wants a say in who controls the drug trade in the new California
 Republic... him. He's been looking into rigging elections down soooouth... *yawn*}
{791}{}{So he's actually planning to have Reno JOIN the Republic... hmmmm. Okay, then,
 let's talk about something else...}
{792}{}{Interesting. I wanted to know some other things about what John's been up to...}

# 161. WHAT HAPPENED (154)
{800}{}{Drugs are illegal in Vault City, of course. The other Citizens found out and revoked my Citizenship. John was the only one I could turn to... he knew that, of course. He'd planned the whole thing.}
{801}{}{So you got your education in Vault City? That's why you sound different than
 everyone else here in New Reno?}

# 162. SORT OF (157)
{810}{}{Just attach the headgear, place the optic sensor over your right eye, then connect
 the other end... hmpphh... (Rolls over.) ..to the Pip-Boy. You'll feel a slight rush,
 some nausea, then your head will feel... clearer.}

# 163. PROOF? (137)
{815}{}{Mmmmmnnn...? I don't know. Maybe John's safe in his room... he prefers keeping
 meticulous records for blackmail purposes.}

# 164. COUNTER UP
{820}{}{(Your question is met with silence... Mrs. Bishop has fallen asleep. She has
 a wide smile on her face and is clutching her pillow tightly, mumbling your name.)}
{821}{}{(Your question is met with silence... Mrs. Bishop has fallen asleep. You can't
 help but wonder if she would've stayed awake longer if you'd been more... skilled,
 but you quickly repress the thought before it hurts your ego.)}
{822}{}{(Slip out of bed quietly.)}

# 165. SEX = POOR
{825}{}{(A few minutes into your love-making, Mrs. Bishop suddenly falls asleep.
 Soft snores begin to emanate from her body.)}
{826}{}{(Finish up, then leave.)}

{900}{}{You have convinced Mrs. Bishop that she can change her life... for the better.}
