{100}{}{You see a squatter.}
{101}{}{You see a man covered in dirt and filth.}
{102}{}{You see a woman covered in dirt and filth.}

{103}{}{What do you want?}
{104}{}{I want you and your friends out of this building. It's come to my attention that Mom intends to turn this place
 into an orphanage to get all those homeless children off the streets. And she can't do that with you squatting here.}
{105}{}{[He snickers uneasily and glances at his fellow squatters for support.] Mom knows the deal. We're not going anywhere
 until she coughs up the money. So unless you brought us a million coins, fuck off.}
{106}{}{Look, Mom doesn't have that kind of money, and even if she did, she'd never pay you, so just forget it. Why not show
 some decency and go squat someplace else? Those homeless kids need this place a hell of a lot more than you do.}
{107}{}{Who're you to say who deserves what? We *like* it here. You can't make us leave.}
{108}{}{Listen, you have two choices: You can either walk out of here on your own two feet, or *I* can remove you -- by dragging
 you out, one corpse at a time.}
{109}{}{([He exchanges a look with his fellow squatters, then looks back at you and shakes his head.] You can't intimidate us.
 No one's kicking us out of here. We'll fight you for our turf.}
{110}{}{[He exchanges a look with his fellow squatters, then looks back at you and nods.] OK, you made your point. It's not like
 we hate kids or anything, hell, most of us were homeless kids ourselves. We were just trying to make some money, you know? The
 only jobs around here involve peddling drugs or pain, and we're not into that. [He sighs.] We'll leave, but where do you suggest
 we go? This place is our home.}
{111}{}{I don't know. That's not my problem.}
{112}{}{I may regret saying this, but if you're serious about wanting jobs, I'm sure Mom could use some help fixing this place up. She's a real nice lady,
 so maybe if you apologize, she'd give you a fair chance to prove you're more than a bunch of lazy opportunists. I'll talk to her about it. But if you try to
 fuck her over, I'll hunt you down and make you pay.}
{113}{}{Screw this, I changed my mind. We ain't leaving. We're staying right here and fighting.}
{114}{}{[He exchanges a look with the other squatters and ponders your words.] You know what? That doesn't sound too bad. In fact, that could work out great,
 if you really think Mom will go for it. While you go talk to her, we'll get started on cleaning this place up. Oh, and thanks for being so cool about things.}
{115}{}{Nevermind.}

#new for RP 1.3
{116}{}{She's not going to pay you. But I'm here to offer you a new deal: You and your friends walk away from here now, and you get to keep your lives.}
{117}{}{Alright, well, I gave it a shot. Bye.}


{120}{}{This is a great idea. We'll get things ready.}

{200}{}{Huh?}
{201}{}{This is our turf.}
{202}{}{You squatting here too?}
{203}{}{Got anything to eat?}

{300}{}{You see a man in work clothes.}
{301}{}{You see a woman in work clothes.}

{310}{}{Hey, thanks for helping to set this up for us. We'll work hard.}
{311}{}{You better. Make sure the children stay out of trouble too.}
{312}{}{We'll do our best.}
{313}{}{Bye.}

#third way to finish quest -added after initial creation, but before official release
{350}{}{Anywhere but here. The Den's a big place, I'm sure you can find somewhere else to crash. Come on, do you really want the children to live on the streets?}
{351}{}{Nah, you're right, that ain't cool for the children. Alright, we'll pack our things and move out. This place had a leaky roof anyway.}
{352}{}{Thanks. This will mean a lot to them. Take care.}
{353}{}{Nah, that ain't our problem. If Mom thinks it's that important to get those kids off the streets, then she should stop being stingy with her cash and share the
 wealth. Yeah, I've changed my mind, we're staying until she pays up. Now this conversation's over, so you better leave if you know what's good for you.}

{360}{}{Alright. No need for this to get out of control. I'll leave you alone.}
{361}{}{Time to clean this place up then. (Attack)}

{400}{}{Thanks again!}
{401}{}{We'll work hard.}
{402}{}{Thanks for being so cool about things.}
{403}{}{We won't let you down.}

{500}{}{We'll collect our things and be out of here soon.}
{600}{}{You've cleared out all the squatters.}
