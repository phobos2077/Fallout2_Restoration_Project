# 3. Gang 1 Won War
{225}{}{Thanks for the tip. That was some fun stuff.}
{226}{}{I knew we could take those pussies.}
{227}{}{Too bad we killed them all. Now what are we to do?}
{228}{}{Are we hot or what?}
{229}{}{We're too good.}
{230}{}{We fucking kicked some ass! Fuck yeah!}

# 4. TRAP NO

# 6. TRAP NOSHOW
{260}{}{I knew those pussies wouldn't show.}
{261}{}{We should just go kick their asses just for thinking about fighting us.}
{262}{}{We would have ripped through them if they had showed.}
{263}{}{I could have taken them on by myself.}
{264}{}{Tyler and I would have kicked some serious ass.}
