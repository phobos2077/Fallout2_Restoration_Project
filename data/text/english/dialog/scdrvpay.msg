{100}{}{You see a man dressed in working clothes.}
{101}{}{It's brahmin buyer. He is expecting Hal's caravan.}
{102}{}{He's smells of brahmin.}

{113}{}{Well, that was the crapper! Afraid there's no money in this run for any of us. Just be happy you're alive.}
{114}{}{Well, the ranchers are none too happy - it's only a $1000 run. Tough luck.}
{115}{}{Well, you had little string of bad luck but did all right. Here's the $2000 you signed on for.}
{116}{}{Hot damn, you were just fine! There's a $1000 bonus in it for you. That and $2000 makes your pay. Redding better watch out tonight!}
{118}{}{You're the worst excuse for a guard I've ever seen. Get the hell out of here.}


{119}{}{Too bad Hal didn't make it.}
{120}{}{Shame about Hal...}
{121}{}{Nice doing business with you.}

{213}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! And the brahmin too! Afraid there's no money in this run for any of us. Just be happy you're alive.}
{214}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! And the ranchers are none too happy - it's only a $1000 run. Tough luck.}
{215}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! At least the brahmin are all right. Here's the $2000 you signed on for.}
{216}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! Still, you managed just fine. There's a $1000 bonus in it for you. That and $2000 makes your pay. Redding better watch out tonight!}
