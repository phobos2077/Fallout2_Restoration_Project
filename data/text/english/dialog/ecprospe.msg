{100}{}{You see a Prospector.}
{101}{}{Hold it right there, stranger! I'm not used to ambushing strangers, but I need supplies and I
 can't leave my claim. Want to do a quick trade?}
{102}{}{Sure.}
{103}{}{I've got nothing to trade. Sorry.}
{104}{}{Booga.}
{105}{}{What a stroke of luck. You can't talk can you? Can't talk, can't tell anyone where my claim
 is. Let's trade.}

{107}{}{OK, beat it! And you better not tell anyone where my claim is.}
{108}{}{[End]}
{109}{}{I think you better keep moving.}
{110}{}{We have nothing more to talk about.}
{111}{}{On your way!}
{112}{}{Go get 'em.}
{113}{}{Can't have you tell'en anyone where my claim is.}
{114}{}{Why'd you go an attack me?}
{115}{}{Now I have to kill you.}
{116}{}{I just wanted some supplies.}
{117}{}{You can have my claim!}
{118}{}{Mercy!}
