{821}{}{You are a total badass. I mean, you start from a simple spear-chucking tribal
 - no offense - and go on to save the whole world. You kick ass. End of story.}
{822}{}{You should replay the game as a different kind of character.}
{823}{}{Tell me everything about your fight with the Enclave...}
{824}{}{Hey, if you want a freebie after saving the world, I'm sure you can talk me into it...}

{828}{}{I hear the Brothers are looking for you. They want to do a film based on your adventure.}
{829}{}{We miss Tim Cain. He used to cook wonderful bread. Then he would spank us like small children.}
{830}{}{I realize I'm just an NPC, but I'm deeply offended by the way women are portrayed in New Reno.}
{831}{}{Women in this town seem like they were designed by some immature sex-starved geek
 who lives in his parent's basement.}
{832}{}{New Reno was designed by Chris Avellone and Tom French. Both of them are sexual GODS.}
{833}{}{Feargus got that frowny-look on his face when he saw how many float text messages I have.
 He's such a sour-puss.}

{1051}{}{A little frisky, eh?}
{1052}{}{Did you bring your own towelette?}
{1053}{}{Yes, they ARE real.}
{1054}{}{Yes, they ARE real, and NO, you can't check.}
{1055}{}{Piss off, ass-for-brains.}
{1056}{}{Wanna wrangle, cowboy?}
{1057}{}{Wanna sink me with your pink torpedo?}
{1058}{}{Need someone to warm your tent?}
{1059}{}{Need someone to share your bedroll?}
{1060}{}{Got some hot-rocks there, pal.}
{1061}{}{Nasty little crotch cobra there.}
{1062}{}{Lookin' for some action?}
{1063}{}{You ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.}
{1064}{}{Looking for a date?}
{1065}{}{Look, no free samples.}
{1066}{}{Heard there was some trouble on Commercial Row...}
{1067}{}{Looking for some company?}
{1068}{}{Only sports going on in Reno nowdays in tonsil hockey...}
{1069}{}{Wanna dance?}
{1070}{}{You ain't never had love 'til you had Reno love.}
{1071}{}{My job? I turn boys into MEN.}
{1072}{}{Can you hammer a six-inch spike through a board with your penis?}
{1073}{}{Been walking this street since last night...}
{1074}{}{Need a friend for the evening? Or just ten minutes?}

{1089}{}{Oh, hello, Mr. Tyler. Going... down?}
{1090}{}{If I have to talk to you afterwards, that's extra.}
{1091}{}{This one guy, Fred Hatch, he wanted to know if there were any "big girls" in town. Weird.}
{1092}{}{Your friend with the bone in his nose... great gimmick.}
{1093}{}{Does your friend with the bone do tricks with his nose or sumthin'?}
{1094}{}{Maybe I should put a bone in my nose. Might attract more female customers.}
{1095}{}{That fella's got a bone in his nose the size of my arm. Keeee-rist.}
{1096}{}{I don't even want to know how that boy got that bone in his nose.}
{1097}{}{Is your friend with the bone in his nose in the business?}

{1110}{}{That Bishop girl is a bed-bunny.}
{1111}{}{She ain't no Jet addict, she's a BONE addict.}
{1112}{}{I heard Vault City has only two types of Citizens. Maybe it was some cloning accident.}
{1113}{}{Felt like I was in a marathon last night...}
{1114}{}{Looking for love, honey?}
{1115}{}{No kissing. It's the rule.}
{1116}{}{Wish Myron would move away. Far away.}

{1122}{}{Looking for a good time?}
{1123}{}{I can't believe how many strippers were at Feargus' bachelor party.}

{1125}{}{I'll give you some play.}

{1131}{}{I'm Dirty Spice.}
{1132}{}{I've got a girlfriend if you want a double-header.}
{1133}{}{Wish Myron was gay.}
{1134}{}{Still don't know why they call it Virgin Street...}
{1135}{}{I wish he'd wear a paper bag sometimes.}
{1136}{}{Buy me a drink?}
{1137}{}{Take a lonely lady on the town?}
{1138}{}{Uh, of course I'm a woman. Just ignore the Adam's apple.}
{1139}{}{I heard some of the girls uptown killed their pimp.}
{1140}{}{Helloooo, stranger.}
{1141}{}{That Jules better leave me alone.}
{1142}{}{Still got that bruise from the headboard...}
{1143}{}{Been worn out ever since that last convention...}
{1144}{}{I wish Gen Con took place in some other town.}
{1145}{}{You could melt metal, you know that?}
{1146}{}{I felt the Earth move, but it was just the chili.}
{1147}{}{Make me melt.}
{1148}{}{I'm a virgin. I'm just not very good at it.}

{1152}{}{I hear the families are getting tense again.}
{1153}{}{Things are pretty slow. I wish that caravan would show.}
{1154}{}{So he dresses up in this deathclaw costume, then...}
{1155}{}{I need help getting out of this dress.}
{1156}{}{Zip me up? Then down again?}
{1157}{}{Sorry, what were you saying? I was too busy staring at your ass.}
{1158}{}{Wanna waste some time?}
{1159}{}{I kicked Jules in his family jewels last week.}
{1160}{}{They don't call me Lady Lucky for nothing.}
{1161}{}{Of *course* I love those brahmin-flavored condoms. Yum.}
{1162}{}{Show a lady a good time?}
{1163}{}{Wish they would invent a sexual placebo for Myron.}
{1164}{}{Need a date, tribal?}
{1165}{}{Want to pow-wow, tribal?}
