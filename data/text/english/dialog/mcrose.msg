{100}{}{You see a pleasantly plump woman.}
{101}{}{You see Rose.}
{102}{}{Her gray hair is done up in a loose bun, and she walks with a slight waddle. You can't help but
 feel relaxed around her.}

{150}{}{I'm sorry, we're closed. There's been a death in the family. [sniff]}
{151}{}{Hey! I'm the only one allowed to go through the lost and found box.}
{152}{}{I'm beginning to think you're a thief!}
{153}{}{Thief! Thief! Thief!}
{154}{}{Welcome to Rose's Bed and Breakfast. My, aren't you the strapping young man. What can Rose help
 you with today?}
{155}{}{Welcome to Rose's Bed and Breakfast. Oh my, what a pretty young lady you are. What can Rose do
 for you today?}
{156}{}{I'm starved! What do you have to eat around here?}
{157}{}{I'd like to rent a room for the night.}
{158}{}{You must hear things working here. Mind if I ask you a few questions?}
{159}{}{[You smack your lips with a loud POP]}
{160}{}{Glad to see you again! What can I do for you?}
{165}{}{Oh my! It's you. Everyone is talking about how you risked your life for us, and solved the
 mystery of the Ghost Farm. Know that you are always welcome here, and of course all your meals are on
 the house. You may also rummage through the lost and found box and take whatever you wish as a special
 reward.}
{166}{}{It's the hero of Modoc! Welcome back.}
{167}{}{I'd really love to have one of your delicious omelets right about now.}
{168}{}{That's what I like to hear. A growing young boy needs to eat to keep up his strength, and I can
 tell you haven't been eating properly. You just sit right down and look at the menu.}
{169}{}{And so you should be. When was the last time you had a good meal, young lady? Why, you're as
 thin as a rail. You just look at the menu and tell Rose what you would like to eat.}
{170}{}{Brahmin fries. [$5]}
{171}{}{Wasteland omelet. [$25]}
{172}{}{Water. [$1000]}
{173}{}{Brahmin dogs. [$5]}
{174}{}{Canis burgers. [$7]}
{175}{}{Shepherd's stew. [$3]}
{176}{}{No thank you; I'm not hungry right now.}
{177}{}{Oh, I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough money. Why don't you come back later?}
{178}{}{But I'm starving! Maybe I can order something cheaper.}
{179}{}{Wait! Can I ask you a few questions?}
{180}{}{Back for some more, I see. You must really like brahmin fries. I'm sorry; since you hold the
 record, you can't enter the contest again until somebody else breaks your score.}
{181}{}{Brahmin fries it is, then. We have a contest on who can eat the most Brahmin fries; so far, the
 record is 36. If you break the record, you don't have to pay the tab for your meal. You look like
 you'd be able to beat the record with no problem. Are you interested in trying?}
{182}{}{That's okay, I'm willing to pay to eat your delicious fried brahmin scrotum.}
{183}{}{I'm so hungry I can probably double that score. Bring it on.}
{184}{}{No thanks; just one order, please.}
{185}{}{Oh, that's just grand. Each order consists of 10 pieces. I'll have to ask you for the money up
 front. I'll refund it as soon as you break the record. That'll be $20, please.}
{186}{}{I don't have that much. Why don't I try for the record later? I'll just get one order. Thanks.}
{187}{}{Sure, I'll get it back when I break the record.}
{188}{}{[Rose takes the money and comes back with a heaping platter of brahmin fries. They are not
 quite what you expected. They appear to be about the size of golf balls, covered in batter and fried in
 oil to a deep, golden brown. You take a tentative bite of one of the fries. These are delicious! You
 start into the meal with zeal.]}
{189}{}{[At around the 34th fry, you start to feel the effects of overeating. A crowd has gathered to
 witness the historic event of the old record being broken. In an attempt to regain your composure, you
 strike up a conversation with Rose.]}
{190}{}{[You pop a fry into your mouth.] 'Mmff... splt... mnch...' Don't talk with your mouth full, dear. [You
 swallow.]}
{191}{}{How do you prepare these? If it's not a secret or anything, I know some people back home who
 would love these.}
{192}{}{Oh, it's no secret. You just dip them in batter, add some salt and fry in grease. [You pop
 another one in your mouth.]}
{193}{}{How do you prepare the brahmin meat? It has such a unique texture. [You pop yet another one in
 your mouth. These are good!]}
{194}{}{That's 37! You just broke the record! [The crowd cheers!]}
{195}{}{[You feel like you've gotten you're second wind and pop another fry into your mouth.]}
{196}{}{[The crowd yells, "38!"] Well, what makes ours taste so special is that you have to harvest it
 while the brahmin is still alive. You just grab the brahmin by the scrotum and 'snip' four with one
 cut. You've got be careful; the brahmin usually gets riled up at that point.}
{197}{}{[The 38th brahmin tidbit must have been going at the speed of light as it is suddenly and
 forcefully propelled from your mouth.]}
{198}{}{We can't count that last one, but you broke the record at 37! Here's your money back.
 Congratulations!}
{199}{}{[You feel sick.]}
{200}{}{Ah, that's my specialty. I hope you're hungry; I guarantee you've never tasted an omelet like
 this one anywhere. [She leaves and returns with the biggest damn omelet you've ever seen.]}
{201}{}{[You feel revitalized after such a big meal.]}
{202}{}{[She quickly disappears behind the counter and returns with your order.]}
{203}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{204}{}{I'm sorry, sweetie, I'm quite busy serving customers. Maybe if you ordered something I'll have
 time to chat with you between orders.}
{205}{}{In that case, I'm starving. What do you have to eat?}
{206}{}{Sure, but make it quick, dear. I don't want to keep the other customers waiting.}
{207}{}{What can you tell me about Cornelius's missing watch?}
{208}{}{Have you ever heard of a GECK?}
{209}{}{What do you know about the Ghost Farm?}
{210}{}{I've never seen an omelet the size of the one you served me. What kind of animal lays such a
 large egg?}
{211}{}{What's a canis burger made of?}
{212}{}{Oh dear! Have you been talking to my husband Cornelius? This whole business with the watch is
 just terrible. Cornelius has got the whole town believing that his best friend, Farrel, took his watch.
 If you've talked to him, I'm sure you've noticed his mind isn't quite functioning properly. I'm pretty
 sure the poor dear just left the watch somewhere and forgot where.}
{213}{}{Now, if you don't need anything else, I have other customers to serve.}
{214}{}{Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{215}{}{One moment, I'm still hungry.}
{216}{}{Did you say GECK? No, I can't say that I have. I have heard of good soup recipe that requires
 three geckos. But no, I haven't heard of anything about a GECK.}
{217}{}{[She shivers involuntarily.] Stay away from there! I've heard tales from travelers about
 rotting bodies tied to stakes, and glowing shapes moving through the fields at night. I don't know how
 much of this is true, but I do know a while back Karl moved out there and hasn't been seen since.}
{218}{}{Ah, you've had the desert omelet. Delicious, wasn't it? Some people say it has healing
 properties. [She looks around nervously.] Oh! Some customers just came in. I'll be right back. [Hmm...
 She never answered your question.]}
{220}{}{Our burgers are made of nothing but the choicest, select, grade-A dog. The meat is ground up and
 made into half-pound patties. And to give it that unique smoky flavor, they are slow grilled over dried
 brahmin dung.}
{221}{}{You poor thing. You look half starved. Come sit down and let Rose get you something to eat. [She
 leaves and returns with a large omelet.] Now, you don't move from that spot until you finish every bit
 of that.}
{222}{}{Sorry, we're full up. A large caravan has all the rooms rented.}
{225}{}{Really!? You must be really thirsty. I raised the price to discourage customers from ordering it.
 Drinking water is at a premium out here, with the lack of rain and the well drying up. Do you still want
 some?}
{226}{}{Yes! I need water desperately.}
{227}{}{Actually, I'm really hungry.}
{228}{}{I'm sorry, we stopped serving omelets. Some fool broke into our coop and killed our... chicken.}
{229}{}{I'm really hungry, so let's see what else you have.}
{230}{}{I was really looking forward to your world-famous omelet. I guess I'll go hungry.}
{231}{}{Ahh! Oogie!}

{300}{}{[She quickly returns with a glass of some brownish liquid substance. It appears that there is
 more dirt than water in the glass. However, you are so thirsty that you drink it anyway.] I brought
 a cookie for you to enjoy with that, sweetie.}
