# 14. I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB . . . [BAD RESPONSE] (6, 10, 11)
{355}{}{Naw... we don't hire muscle like the other families, 'least not now. }
{356}{}{Naw... we don't traffic with slaver trash like the other families. }
{357}{}{You better git.}

{359}{}{All right then.}

# 15. I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL I SEE MR. WRIGHT. (14)

{366}{}{I'm NOT leaving.}

{381}{}{No. Is that a common occurrence?}
{383}{}{No, I was just curious. Later, Keith.}

# 18. NO. IS THAT A COMMON OCCURRENCE? (17)
{390}{}{Sometimes. She's always preachin' and hollerin' about the evils o' drink and gamblin' and damn
 near everything else. Causes quite a stir, sometimes, and gets Dad real upset.}
{391}{}{Does your Mom have any idea what your family does?}
{392}{}{I'll bet. Well, thanks for talking with me, Keith.}

# 19. DOES YOUR MOM HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOUR FAMILY DOES? (17, 18)
{400}{}{Naw, she don't know half of it. She thinks Dad's all clean and above the board, but she ain't too
 bright to catch on to what he's doin'. If she found that still beneath the train station, she'd raise cain, she would.}
{401}{}{I see. Thanks, Keith.}

# 20. MOM = AFTER WRECKED STILLS (17)
{410}{}{(Shakes head.) She done it this time, wrecking Pa's stills n' all. The workers were too afraid
 ta stop her, and Pa threw a fit, and she threw one right back at him. (Shrugs.) It'll take Pa a while to
 get back up on his feet.}

# 21. CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT RICHARD? (6, 10)
{420}{}{Good kid. Damn, if we ever find out who done it to him...}
{421}{}{Any ideas who might've done it?}
{422}{}{Well, hopefully you'll find the killer. Bye, Keith.}

# 22. ANY IDEAS WHO MIGHT'VE DONE IT? (21)
{430}{}{Lotta other families sell Jet, coulda been any one of them. Mordino's got the most Jet dealers, though,
 cause they make the most Jet. Me, I'm bettin' it was one of them.}
{431}{}{What dealers do you suspect?}
{432}{}{Can you tell me a little about Richard?}

# 23. WHAT DEALERS ARE SUSPECT? (22, 24)
{440}{}{Bunch of 'em: Jagged Jimmy J on 2nd Street, that old sonuvabitch Renesco in the West End... and Jules
 deals, too, at th' fronta town, but mostly to dumb tourists. Then there's Little Jesus Mordino.}
{441}{}{Little Jesus Mordino?}
{442}{}{Can you tell me a little more about Richard?}
{443}{}{Thanks for the info, Keith.}

# 24. CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE MORE ABOUT RICHARD? (22, 23, 27)
{450}{}{Quiet kid, clean kid. Kept outta trouble, and for a Wright, that's something. We buried
 him on the Golgotha plains a while ago, but even so, Mom still don't want his room disturbed.
 It's hard for her to let go, y'know?}
{451}{}{Which room was his? Do you think your mother would mind if I looked in there?}
{452}{}{Any dealers you suspect may have given him the Jet?}
{454}{}{Buried in Golgotha, huh? Hmmm. Thanks for the info, Keith.}

# 25. CAN I LOOK AROUND HIS ROOM? (24)
{460}{}{His room? It's the empty one next to Mom's room, the second one down from the kitchen. As fer looking around... well... look, don't stay
 long... and don't mess the place up, or Mom'll pop a clip if she finds out.}
{461}{}{Thanks, Keith. I won't be long.}

# 26. JOB, SUCCESS . . . (12, 13)
{470}{}{Hold on. (Knocks on door behind him.) Pa? (He sticks his head in, there's some mumbling, then he comes back and nods at the door.)
 You ken go in, but watch out. Dad's in a pissy mood.}
{471}{}{Thanks.}

# 27. LIL' JESUS (23)
{480}{}{He's Big Jesus' son. A bastard, more like. He mighta caught Richard alone, then pumped him fulla
 Jet outta spite. You looking for him, check out the Desperado. Little Jesus hangs out there with his old man.}
