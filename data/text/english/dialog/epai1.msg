{200}{}{Welcome to the EPA! When touring our facility, please don't be alarmed by the sight of translucent people
 wandering the halls. They're not ghosts -- they're our friendly new staff of holograms! Think of them as computer programs
 given human form through the magic and wonders of science! They'd be happy to answer any questions you may have,
 so please, don't hesitate to approach them. WARNING! Holograms exist via a suspended crystal with anti-gravimetric
 properties. These can be highly volatile if tampered with, so please, for your own safety, do not attempt to touch any
 of the holograms. Thank you and enjoy your tour!}
