{220}{}{Log Entry #87983: It's finally happened. They've launched their nukes at us and we've launched ours at them.
 Brass won't go into detail, but it's probably already Judgment Day topside by now. Radio communications have been disrupted
 indefinitely. Good thing I've grown used to this place. I've got no illusions about ever seeing the surface again.}

{222}{}{They brought in a woman to be cryoed. Didn't say why; only that it was top secret business. She was quite the looker.
 Petite, Chinese-looking, and there was something about her eyes. She took down two secret service agents when she found
 out what we had in mind. Caught them off guard and opened them both up with one of Delnay's scalpels, Jesus Christ. That was
 a sight for tired eyes. The third one managed to subdue her. It's not like she wouldn't be spending the rest of her
 life down here if she'd managed to kill them all, anyway. She's unconscious now and they're prepping her tank.
 It's right next to that psychopath Patrick's, too. What a shame. I would've liked to have gotten to know her better.

{230}{}{Log Entry #81977: Dexter "Dex" Patrick is a rather interesting specimen. He's a narcissistic, woman hating,
 sociopathic murderer, known to occasionally dabble in necrophilia and cannibalism. He is cold hearted to the extreme,
 showing no remorse for his victims, who ranged from innocent children to the elderly and disabled. His preferred targets
 were attractive young women, who he'd usually seduce into intercourse before brutally dispatching them.}
{231}{}{[MORE]}
{232}{}{Despite his antisocial behavior, he remains remarkably sociable, even charming. In fact, several female
 staff members seem to be taken with him, despite knowing the numerous atrocities he's committed. Dex's confirmed
 victims is currently 68, though he has boasted the actual number is well into the triple digits.
 While Dex has proven to be a compulsive liar, I still find it difficult to doubt the validity of his claim.}
{233}{}{[MORE]}
{234}{}{The only emotional attachment Dex seems to have is for a mid-20th century rock 'n roll idol, whom he admires
 as a role model and perhaps even as a father figure. He's also shown an unhealthy attachment to a severed human ear,
 which we have identified as belonging to Vicky Safron, Dex's high school sweet heart and one of his early victims.
 He claims to keep the ear in his pocket so Vicky can hear the screams of all his victims.}
{235}{}{[MORE]}
{236}{}{I've decided to have Dexter frozen for the time being, as the government has re-routed funds away from our
 project in order to further fuel the war effort, and my team is being re-assigned to other locations. Let it be noted
 that I deem this a terrible mis-step, as our studies on the nature of human evil are progressing swiftly and I believe
 we are near a major breakthrough that would be far more valuable to our government than the production of more "tin suits".
 But I digress.}
{237}{}{[MORE]}
{238}{}{Dex is to remain frozen here until the powers-that-be come to their senses and resurrect this vastly important
 project. I only hope I'm still around to resume my work when that day comes.

{240}{}{Log Entry #80052: Sergeant Christopher "Cat" Jules was assigned to the EPA military security detail on 17/02/2074.
 Prior to this, he was attached to a reconnaissance unit of the 205th Airborne. The Sergeant has an impressive combat record,
 and is one of the highest-graded energy arms and unarmed combat specialists in his unit. However, these achievements are
 marred by an equally long history of accusations of very petty theft, repeated counts of being out of uniform, and an attitude
 of extreme arrogance to superior officers.}
{241}{}{[MORE]}
{242}{}{Sgt. Jules was recruited as a test subject for the Human Reflex Enhancement Project on 10/05/2075 in exchange for the removal of
 some of these reports from his file. Complications arose from the initial trial and Sgt. Jules was sedated for the safety
 of himself those around him.}
{243}{}{[MORE]}
{244}{}{A few days have passed and Sgt. Jules appears to be in good health, but he has developed lengthened canines and
 certain eccentric characteristics in addition to the project goals of improved reflexes and heightened sensory capability.
 I have logged several reports with the base Commander requesting further funding, but alas it seems there are those who do not
 wish for my project to continue. This is quite a shame, since the tissue samples and psych reports for Sgt. Jules indicate
 only minor disfigurement and a tendency to a slightly reduced attention span. Other than this, he is perfectly fit
 for service and in fact, he is likely more capable than before as a result of the treatment. Until more funding is
 received for this project, Sgt. Jules shall remain in suspended animation.
