 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side. I can tell when a guy is handy

{911}{}{. I see you've been doing quite well for yourself. I'm Obi-Wan-Killap: I make Fallout work like it should have from the very beginning.}
{912}{}{Wow. Well, thank you for that, Mr. Killap. How did you do it?}
{913}{}{What the Hell is Fallout?}
{914}{}{Ok. And who, pray tell, are these other people?}

{920}{}{I am a Programming Master, skilled in the way of The Source. It is an energy field created by all digital things. It surrounds us and penetrates us.
 It binds the galaxy together. You, me - the tree - the rock. Pixilated beings are we....not this crude matter *pokes you*.
 I have learned to use this power through years of staring at a computer screen.}
{930}{}{Fallout is the world you are in. I created it, or at least, made it work like it was supposed to. You see, not
 long ago, this world was in chaos. Travelers that came here were often killed by the huge number of bugs that roamed
 the wasteland corrupting saved games indiscriminately. The gods of this world had been careless. But then I came, and,
 using the power of The Source, my friends and I cleaned up the wasteland. You could say I am the savior. I am seen by
 many as a hero: The Bear Dude.}
{940}{}{These are my companions. They helped me improve this world: MIBoba Fe88, Hivan Zolo, Contie-bacca, Darek Vader, Jotisz the Hutt,
 R2Qwerty, Chris3ParksO, Yosan12, Empress Timeslip, Luke Skynet, Mon-Morticia, Kanhef, HawkEyE, Adam Dravean, Mr. Wolna, encinodude,
 Minigun Jim, Bofast, Pixote, Mash, Mikael Grizzly, x'il, Per, and the Masses. They all helped in the great project to restore
 this world from the bug infestation. The only good bug is a dead bug.}
 
#response to 920
{921}{}{Wow. Our shaman always said there was more to this world than what I can see, hear, touch, taste and feel. Can you teach me to use the power of The Source?}
{922}{}{I think I've heard enough religious mumbo-jumbo to keep me stocked for another nuclear winter. Frankly, I prefer a plasma pistol at my side.}
{923}{}{Oh great, another kookie religious nutbag. I'm outta here.}

#response to 930
{931}{}{I see. Well, actually, I was under the impression I was the hero of this story. I run around looting shit and killing people - you know - heroically. Oh, and I talk to them sometimes, but that part can get tiresome.
 I just click through it to get to the fun bit.}
{932}{}{Great work, Mr. Killap. I really appreciate all your time and hard work spent cleaning up the wasteland. If what you say is true, then you should know that I, too, am a hero. In fact, I've squashed quite a few bugs myself.}

{935}{}{And we are grateful that you have destroyed the Enclave. You are the true hero here.}
{936}{}{Whatever gets you through the day.}

#response to 935-936
{937}{}{So, how exactly did you clean up this world?}

{941}{}{Hmm. those names somehow sound familiar... Well, I think I'll go talk to them.}

#player > level 15
{950}{}{Indeed I can. You must learn to use your feelings: let go of your conscious mind. Turn off the monitor. Close your eyes, and FEEL The Source flowing through the mouse ... (Follow his instructions.)}
{951}{}{You lack the experience to start training. Return to me when you've at least learned some basic Programming, young padawan.}

{960}{}{As you wish, young }
{961}{}{. But before you go on your way, remember this: Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Now go, and may The Source be with you.}
#player has high karma
{962}{}{. Your actions on your quest have proved you good, kind and honest. Take this to aid you in your struggle against the Dark Side: it is your ancestor's light saber. This is the weapon of a Java Knight.
 Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. And though you may be tempted to use it to arbitrarily cut people in half for entertainment, you should use it only in service of good.
 Good luck, and may The Source be with you, my friend.}
{963}{}{What?! My ancestor, The Vault Dweller, had one of these?! I don't remember finding this in Fallout 1! *run off to check*}
{964}{}{Thank you, Mr. Bear Dude. For everything. May The Source be with you too.}

#Timeslip

{1012}{}{Wow. You're creepy. And your face looks awful.}
{1013}{}{That's nice. Gotta go.}

{1021}{}{Silence! Years of working in the dark may have distorted my looks, but in this mind are the powers of a God! Using The Source I create weather, mastered entire worlds and tweak that which cannot be tweaked!

{1030}{}{Ignorant fool. Your overconfidence is your weakness, and my faith in your friends is ... er ... mine. *looks confused* Be gone from my sight!}
{1040}{}{Wait! You will leave IF and WHEN I decide. In case you haven't noticed, you have been exceedingly evil in your quest.
 Your hate has made you powerful and your character has developed according to my desires. Anger, fear, hatred ... of the dark side are they.
 Now you will become my apprentice and fulfill your place AT MY SIDE!}

{1041}{}{As you wish, my master. I'm at your bidding.}
{1042}{}{Not interested. Bye.}

{1045}{}{Go forth and wreak havoc my child.}
{1046}{}{Begone!}

#response to 1041
{1050}{}{Eeeeeeexcellent. Then take this Java weapon. Use it. Kill indiscriminately. USE YOUR AGRRESSIVE FEELINGS, CHILD! (He hands you a red lightsaber.)}

{1113}{}{Right. I think you're the one that needs rescuing, pal... from your own movie career. Bye.}

{1120}{}{Yes, I'm here to rescue you. I created the basis to what you see at the Abbey, and there you will find salvation. There you will find the light!}
{1121}{}{I've actually already been there. I 'rescued' a lot stuff from getting lost in all those drawers and containers.}
{1122}{}{Amen brother. Thank you for aiding in the creation of that place of peace and solace. And just when I needed to rest my radiated feet and seek spiritual rejuvenation.}
{1123}{}{I remember that place. No qualified shaman though, and no herb-superb. I don't know who's idea of a spiritual center that is, but it's not mine.}
{1124}{}{Oh? And where is this place that can rescue me?}
{1125}{}{Cuck-oo! Bye bye now!}

{1130}{}{You should return there again. It is a safe haven in these harsh Wastes.}
{1131}{}{I'm on my way, Mr. Skynet. Thanks for everything. Goodbye.}
{1132}{}{Well, I think YOU should go there Skybrain, and stay there. I'm outta here. Freak.}

{1651}{}{Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.}

{1660}{}{[He nods and looks off into the distance.] You know, Dex wasn't my only contribution. I also helped the Bear Dude in sprucing this world up by serving as adviser, tester, and guardian of canon and original intent. But mostly, I was tasked with bringing all the new wasteland speech up to par. It's been a hell of a long road, but if you ask me, this thing turned out pretty fuckin' sweet.
