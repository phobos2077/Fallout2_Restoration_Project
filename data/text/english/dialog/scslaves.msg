{100}{}{You see a miserable wretch of human being.}
{101}{}{You still see a miserable wretch of a human being.}
{102}{}{You see a really, really miserable wretch of a human being. Why are you staring?}
{103}{}{Help me! Please, don't turn your back on me.}
{104}{}{My master says I shouldn't talk to anybody.}
{105}{}{Let me tell you something - my master's a real asshole.}
{106}{}{Really, I don't mind being a slave. It's a good life - I get meals and my mistress is pretty good to me.}
{107}{}{Go away! Leave me alone!}
{108}{}{You! You've got to help us! Overthrow the oppressors!}
{109}{}{Don't talk to me! I don't want another beating.}
{110}{}{Slavery is just a mental construct. After all, are you really free?}
{111}{}{No more! Please, not the House of Pain!}
{112}{}{Stay away from me!}
{113}{}{Monster! You and your kind did this to me!}
{114}{}{The judgment of the Almighty shall fall upon you!}
{115}{}{I obey your every word.}
{116}{}{And the meek shall inherit the earth.}
{117}{}{I'll be good. I'm a good slave.}
{118}{}{Freedom! Sweet blessed freedom!}
{119}{}{Look what you've done - you've ruined my life!}
{120}{}{Can't stop. Gotta run. Can't let them catch me.}
{121}{}{Shit! I'm doomed - they're gonna hunt me down and kill me.}
{122}{}{Where do I go now? What do I do?}
{123}{}{Thanks a lot. Now I got some slaver blood to spill.}
{124}{}{I don't believe it - I'm free!}
