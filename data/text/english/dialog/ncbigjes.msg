{470}{}{Have... you done as I asked?}
{471}{}{No, I haven't delivered the package yet.}
{472}{}{Yes, I delivered it to Ramirez as you asked.}
{473}{}{Yes, I've been to the Stables and dropped off your package... do you know what they DO there? They're torturing
 slaves with drugs.}

# 34. THE CORPSE GOT A NAME? (32)
{610}{}{This man, Louis Salvatore... he has killed many of my men... many PROUD men of the Mordino family. He... butchered them
 in the street like... dogs. (His hand clenches into a fist.) It is my will that this man die.}

{612}{}{Wait a minute. Louis Salvatore who rules the Salvatore family? The ones that have the lightbringers that
 can slice men in half?}

# 37. I'LL DO IT (34, 35, 36)
{640}{}{(Nods.) That is good. The man is old... a cripple... he hides in his bar, "Salvatore's," near the Bishop Casino.
 He is a... coward and never leaves his room upstairs. When he is... dead, return.}
{641}{}{Cripple?}
{642}{}{All right.}

# 38. CRIPPLE? (37)
{650}{}{(Nods.) The butcher's legs... are weak. (Jesus wipes his forehead, then draws another weak breath.)
 He also has... difficulty... breathing. He takes air through an... oxygen tank.}

{652}{}{I'll be back when he is dead, Senor Mordino.}

# 39. KILL SALVATORES (WTG)

{662}{}{He is dead. Your family is avenged, Senor Mordino.}
{663}{}{No, I shall return when I have killed him.}
{664}{}{Salvatore's too well-guarded. I'm going to have to cancel on this job.}

{670}{}{If you... run from this job, I will have you... KILLED.}
{671}{}{Since you put it that way, I shall return when he's dead.}

# 42. YOU HAVE DONE AS I ASKED. . . (41)
{690}{}{(Nods.) Your success... pleases me. I would welcome you into the Family Mordino. (Clasps your shoulders.) Will
 you join our family? Your strength shall be... our strength.}
{691}{}{It would please me to become a member of Family Mordino.}
{692}{}{I can't join the Mordinos. But don't get me wrong, Big Jesus: It was a pleasure working with you.}

{700}{}{(Nods.) I'm sorry that is your choice. As I said, your success pleases me... I would hate for your skills
 to be used by one of my... competitors. (Motions to his guards, who reach for their weapons.)}

# 44. YOU HAVE DONE AS I ASKED. . . (42)
{710}{}{That is good. Do you have... a name by which you wish to be called? All Mordinos... all Reno... shall
 know this name.}
{711}{}{Yeah, how about...}

# 45. CALL ME. . . (44)
{720}{}{... that is a good name. (Nods.) The Mordino name has... weight in New Reno. Visit... the Cat's Paw... New Reno Arms... and
 tell them you are of my family... they will treat you well.}

# 46. WHAT ABOUT RICHARD? (7, 11)
{730}{}{(Stares at you for a long time, then squints in confusion.) Why... do you ask me this? I have... HEARD what happened. (Wipes
 his brow.) The boy took too much Jet and died.}
{731}{}{That's the problem. The Mordinos are the biggest suppliers of Jet in New Reno. That makes you the ones who will
 take the blame.}
{732}{}{Do you know where he got the Jet?}
{733}{}{All right then. Just asking. I had some other questions...}
{734}{}{I see. I think I better be going.}

# 47. YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE BLAME (46)
{740}{}{(Wheezes, wipes more sweat from his forehead.) If the Wrights had the... SENSE they were born with, they would... know
 we are not the only family with Jet in New Reno. We... do NOT kill children.}
{741}{}{Just adults, huh? I mean, Jet takes a while to kill someone, but it works, right?}
{742}{}{Somebody else might, and they might blacken the Mordino name. You know who might have sold Richard the Jet
 that killed him?}
{743}{}{I see. Look, I had some other questions...}
{744}{}{Thanks for the information, Senor Mordino. I must be going now.}

# 48. YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT TO HIM? (46, 47)
{750}{}{(Shakes head.) I... know little of the lives of pushers in Reno. (Takes a raspy breath, coughs slightly.) You... might ask
 my son... in the casino, below.}
{751}{}{I will. I had some other questions...}
{752}{}{I will. Thanks, Senor Mordino.}

# 49. I HAVE A HEART CONDITION . . . (7, 11)
{760}{}{The temperature does not... agree with me. My breathing is... sometimes difficult. In times of stress or other physical
 activity, I tire quickly. Sometimes, I have chest pains.}
{761}{}{Really? Well, it's good you don't take any methamphetamines or stimulants, then. I had some other questions...}
{762}{}{I see. I better be going now.}

# 50. I HAVE A HEART CONDITION . . . (7)
{770}{}{I do not know you... you come to me... without anyone's word to give your offer... weight. (Wipes his brow, then takes
 a deep, rattling breath.) I have NO work for you.}
{771}{}{C'mon, give me a chance. Give me a job, any job... I can do it.}

# 51. RAMIREZ IS A JETHEAD (24)
{780}{}{Not everyone at the Stables... KNOWS they are test subjects.}

# 52. COME AGAIN? (51)
{790}{}{Ramirez let... four slaves escape last month. (Shakes his head slightly.) That is not good. Within the
 hour, the Jet you gave Ramirez will stop his... heart. It is PUNISHMENT.}
{792}{}{You used me to KILL that guy? That's it, Jesus, I'm outta here.}

{850}{}{You have collected Big Jesus's tribute.}
