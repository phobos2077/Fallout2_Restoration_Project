{103}{}{Man... Wong sure is a slave driver.}
{104}{}{Work, work, work. That's all we're good for.}
{105}{}{We'll change the wasteland with this experiment!}
{106}{}{Look out, wasteland! We have something for you!}
{107}{}{I want to see the sun again.}
{108}{}{Mix this. Mix that. I get so bored sometimes.}
{109}{}{Did you see the newest results of the big experiment! Most pleasing!}
{110}{}{Excuse me.}

{116}{}{Ha! Teach those spies to try to break in!}
{117}{}{The hackers will never try THAT again.}
{118}{}{If we can't beat them with science, we beat them with our fighters.}
{119}{}{Lo Pan and the Dragon together. That's a scary thought.}
{120}{}{That hacker did not last long.}
{121}{}{Work, work, work. That's all we're good for.}
{122}{}{We'll change the wasteland!}

{133}{}{I want revenge on the hackers!}
{134}{}{Someday we'll find out who hacked us.}
{135}{}{Work, work, work. That's all we're good for.}

{144}{}{We're doing good work here! Don't ruin it!}
{145}{}{We're trying to save the wasteland, you idiot!}
{146}{}{No! Not our scientists!}
{147}{}{Help! Guards!}
{148}{}{Please! You don't understand!}
{149}{}{No! Our experiments!}
