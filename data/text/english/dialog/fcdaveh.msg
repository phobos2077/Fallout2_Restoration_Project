{100}{}{You see a sandy-haired man.}
{101}{}{You see Dave H.}
{102}{}{You see a sandy-haired man with a hopeful glint to his eye.}
{103}{}{Why do you want to hurt us?}
{104}{}{How can I help you, enlightened one?}
{105}{}{I'm going to move on Vikki... umm... soon.}
{106}{}{How can I help you?}
{107}{}{What do you want?}
{108}{}{Da... oooh...}
{109}{}{Who are you?}
{110}{}{What do you do here?}
{111}{}{I talked to Vikki. She and Juan made fun of you and said you're not a real man.}
{112}{}{I talked to Vikki. She said you're hot and she wants you sometime.}
{113}{}{You want me to talk Vikki up for you?}
{114}{}{Nevermind. Bye.}
{115}{}{Ummm... oookay. Whatever. Say, what's that over there?
[As you turn to look, he whips back to what he was doing and ignores you.]}
{116}{}{[DONE]}
{117}{}{I'm Dave Handy. I'm down from Canada.}
{118}{}{So, what do you do here?}
{119}{}{What brought you down?}
{120}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{121}{}{I show these guys how to move their data and I answer stupid questions all day long.}
{122}{}{Would you be able to hack into the Shi database?}
{123}{}{What sort of stupid questions?}
{124}{}{Well, I have other questions for you.}
{125}{}{Sounds great. Bye.}
{126}{}{Promise not to laugh.}
{127}{}{Okay.}
{128}{}{No, forget it.}
{129}{}{The Hub recruiter, Vikki Goldman. I saw one of her movies up in Canada, and I just knew that she'd fall in love with me. It hasn't happened yet, but I'm working on it.}
{130}{}{I'll keep it under my hat. I have some more questions.}
{131}{}{Ha ha! What a schlep you are! She's a porn star, buddy. She doesn't want you.}
{132}{}{You realize that she'll just act interested in you to make sure you stay a good Hubologist, right?}
{133}{}{Well, yeah... but it's worth it in case something happens!}
{134}{}{If you say so... if you say so. I have more questions.}
{135}{}{Whatever. See you.}
{136}{}{::he sits in stunned silence for a moment::
::pain crosses his face::
Oh well.
::he turns his head away::}
{137}{}{I'll bet you want to get back at her.}
{138}{}{Sorry. I have more questions.}
{139}{}{Having delivered that news... so long!}
{140}{}{You bet I do. What do you need?}
{141}{}{I need the vertibird plans from your computer.}
{142}{}{I need you to format the Hubologist hard drive.}
{143}{}{I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the Poseidon tanker.}
{144}{}{I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.}
{145}{}{Nothing. So long.}
{146}{}{There you go. Now get out of here. I'm going to format the computer and leave.}
{147}{}{I need the vertibird plans from your computer.}
{148}{}{I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the Poseidon tanker.}
{149}{}{I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.}
{150}{}{Well, I was really just kidding. She didn't actually say that.}
{151}{}{Good luck. See ya!}
{152}{}{There. Teach these bastards to use and reject me. Goodbye.}
{153}{}{Well, I was really just kidding. She didn't actually say that.}
{154}{}{Goodbye.}
{155}{}{She didn't say that. Oh good.}
{156}{}{So, I've done all this harm for nothing. I'm going to kill you now.}
{157}{}{Try it.}
{158}{}{She did? Really? Wow. ::a beatific smile slowly crosses his face:: Thanks! What can I do for you?}
{159}{}{I need the vertibird plans from your computer.}
{160}{}{I need you to format the Hubologist hard drive.}
{161}{}{I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the Poseidon tanker.}
{162}{}{I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.}
{163}{}{Ahh, nothing. Go on and have some fun.}
{164}{}{There you go. Anything else?}
{165}{}{I need the vertibird plans from your computer.}
{166}{}{I need you to format the Hubologist hard drive.}
{167}{}{I want you to reroute the fuel from the spaceship into the Poseidon tanker.}
{168}{}{I want you to hack into the Shi databases and get some fuel channeled to the Poseidon tanker.}
{169}{}{Nope. So long!}
{170}{}{Format the hard drive? Are you kidding? No way! I can't do that!}
{171}{}{It's just a routine cleaning. I've backed up everything else already.}
{172}{}{Oh, all right. I have more questions.}
{173}{}{Oh, all right. Bye.}
{174}{}{Oh. Well, if you've backed everything up, I'll do it. ::he taps at the keyboard:: There you go.}
{175}{}{Thanks! So long!}
{176}{}{I just played you like a sucker. So long!}
{177}{}{I'll check that myself. I don't think it's safe to format the mainframe just yet.}
{178}{}{All right. I have more questions.}
{179}{}{All right. Bye.}
{180}{}{No, no... I'd be too embarrassed.}
{181}{}{Fine, fine. I have more questions.}
{182}{}{Fine, fine.}
{183}{}{I should be able to. But only if you have a specific task in mind.}
{184}{}{Divert fuel into the Poseidon tanker.}
{185}{}{Can't think of anything specific right now. I'll let you know.}
{186}{}{Oh, like:}
{187}{}{"Does my terminal have 3D-card support?"}
{188}{}{"Why can't I get multi-user hookup?"}
{189}{}{"I think we ought to change the interface, even though this one works perfectly well!"}
{190}{}{"Why can't I use a sword or a chainsaw on my monitor?"}
{191}{}{"I should be able to have two guns. Why can't I use two guns?"}
{192}{}{"The interface on my terminal is slow and clunky. I think it's your fault."}
{193}{}{Like that.}
{194}{}{I see. Those people sound like they're lots of fun. I have more questions.}
{195}{}{I see. Well, so long.}
{196}{}{I could do that. But I'd need a good reason to do it, and I just don't have that. Sorry. Anything else?}
{197}{}{Yes, I have more questions.}
{198}{}{No, I guess not.}
{199}{}{Sorry, their system hasn't been responding for a while. There's no way for me to get into it. Anything else?}
{200}{}{I'm going to move on Vikki... umm... soon. What can I help you with?}
{201}{}{Their system hasn't been responding for a while. Looks like someone formatted their databases. Like what I'll be doing here once I'm done with you. Anything else?}
