{100}{}{You see a short, burly, miner with curly black hair.}
{101}{}{You see Caminetto, a brawling miner for the Kokoweef Mine.}
{102}{}{You see a thick-set man with the air of a confident fighter.}
{103}{}{Caminetto, your Kokoweef miners are all show and no go.}
{104}{}{I'll show you where to go, Blasphemous Bette.}
{105}{}{You couldn't show me where to go with a roadmap.}
{106}{}{Just 'cause I wouldn't wanna get that close to ya.}
{107}{}{Don't flatter yourself, you little runt.}
{108}{}{You'd be lucky to get a runt instead of that drilling machine you normally use.}
{109}{}{Well, at least my drill lasts more than thirty seconds.}
{110}{}{No wonder the Morningstar's machinery is always breaking down.}
{111}{}{I'll show you broken down, with my fists!}
{112}{}{Your fists? Your breath is bad enough.}
{113}{}{I don't know how you could smell that over your own 3-week stink.}
{114}{}{Stink? Hell, looking at you causes me enough pain.}
{115}{}{You don't know nuthin' about pain, but I'll teach you something.}
{116}{}{You teach me?}
{117}{}{Yeah, that's right. 'Cause your momma sure didn't.}
{118}{}{You talkin' about my momma now? Ain't that creative.}
{119}{}{I'll do a better job of creating a new face for you. That old one sure ain't much to look at.}
{120}{}{You and what army?}
{121}{}{Just me, that's all it's gonna take. But I bet us Morningstars can take you wimpy Kokoweefs anytime.}
{122}{}{I don't think so. Kokoweef rules the roost here. I'm gonna have to learn you that.}
{123}{}{Gonna be hard for you to do that when I beat you unconscious.}
{124}{}{Think you might get lucky then, huh?}
{125}{}{I don't need luck to pound you flat.}
{126}{}{You're gonna pound me with your fat? Uh oh, now I *am* scared.}
{127}{}{Put up or shut up you, little shrimp.}
{128}{}{Come get some, you hag.}
{129}{}{Now who's hoping to get lucky?}
{130}{}{That's it, I'm gonna take you out for that one.}
{131}{}{Who the hell is this watching us?}
{132}{}{Someone new. Hey, this is a private matter! Let's get 'em!}
{133}{}{Fer once I agree with you. Get 'em!}
{134}{}{You sure did yourself a job there. Put every damn miner in Redding behind bars.}
{135}{}{You got some nerve, putting us away.}
{136}{}{We was just having a bit of fun. Let us out.}
{137}{}{What we was doin' weren't none of your business.}
{138}{}{Get the hell out of here.}
{139}{}{Get me out of here.}
{140}{}{Hey, let me out.}
{141}{}{I'm innocent.}
{142}{}{I didn't do nothin'}
{143}{}{Sheriff? I gotta take a leak.}
{144}{}{What the hell do you want?}
{145}{}{I'm not going to let you fight each other.}
{146}{}{I was just wondering what's going on here.}
{147}{}{Me and my boys are gonna teach these Morningstar creampuffs a lesson. Starting with Blasphemous
 Bette over there.}
{148}{}{Why? What started it?}
{149}{}{I see. Well, I can't let you do that. You have to break it up now.}
{150}{}{We just got tired of their ornery selves stinking up our bar.}
{151}{}{That's not good enough. I can't let you fight.}
{152}{}{Well, that seems like a problem, all right. I don't blame you. Good luck.}
{153}{}{Oh yeah? How're you gonna stop us?}
{154}{}{I'll kill the first person to throw a punch.}
{155}{}{I'm just going to ask you real nice like. Then I'm going to load up my weapons and wait for some
 target practice.}
{156}{}{The Sheriff asked me to help him out while he's laid up with a bum leg. I've got to keep my word
 to him.}
{157}{}{Well, OK... for the Sheriff's sake I 'spose we can hold off a bit.}
{158}{}{Thanks. I was hoping you'd see things that way. Goodbye.}
{159}{}{Well, aren't you a goody-two-shoes. I don't think I like your tone, pal.}
{160}{}{You don't have to like it. You're going to walk with me to the Jail or I'm gonna drag your
 corpse there. Your choice.}
{161}{}{Oh, I'm sorry. I certainly didn't mean to be rude. I'll be leaving now. Goodbye.}
{162}{}{All right, all right. I'll go if you jail Bette, too. That sounds like a fair deal.}
{163}{}{You're not in a position to make deals.}
{164}{}{That's not a bad idea. Putting some bars between the two of you should cool things off a bit.
 Come along, you two.}
{165}{}{Aren't you tough. I don't think you can take us without people getting killed. You think the
 Sheriff is gonna like that?}
{166}{}{No, I guess he wouldn't.}
{167}{}{Doesn't matter to me. It won't be *my* blood that's spilled.}
{168}{}{I guess you got me there. Okay, I'll come quietly. (to the others) Go on back to the mine, lads.
 I'll see you tomorrow.}
{169}{}{Good choice.}
{170}{}{Don't worry, I'm bringing Bette along to keep you company. Right, Bette?}
{171}{}{I don't think it's going down like that. I think you just put yourself in the middle and now
 we're going to both take you apart.}
{172}{}{Then I'll just have to jail both you and Bette.}
{173}{}{Then I'll just have to kill both you and Bette.}
{174}{}{Hmm, I think I'm needed in another part of Redding. Right away. Goodbye.}
{175}{}{You bet he wouldn't. Why don't you just go back and tell him that there wasn't anything you could do?}
{176}{}{That's it. I've had enough of your mouth. One last chance: Go quietly or I'll tear you apart.}
{177}{}{Maybe I'll do that. I sure don't want to hurt anyone. Goodbye.}
{178}{}{All right, I think we can see the writing on the wall - right, Bette? (she nods) You got us.
 Take us in, Sheriff.}
{179}{}{That's more like it.}
{180}{}{Nope, too late now. I'm gonna have to open up a can of whoop-ass on you two. }
# Begin Seraph's Code
{181}{}{Don't worry; I won't be startin' any trouble tonight.}
# End Seraph's Code
