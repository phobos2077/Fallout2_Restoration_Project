{100}{}{You see someone whose skin has been very badly burnt. It seem to be standing guard here.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul acting as a guard.}
{102}{}{You see someone whose skin seems to have been burned with radiation. That much radiation looks
 as though it should have killed them, but it they seem well enough. They look as though they're
 standing guard here.}

{110}{}{You better not try stealing again.}
{111}{}{All you smoothskins are alike. You better not try stealing again.}
{112}{}{Thought you might have left something in my pocket?}
{113}{}{Cut that out, or I'll cut you out.}
{114}{}{I wouldn't do that again, if I were you.}
{115}{}{Cutting your hands off would only be a start.}
{116}{}{Aren't you the friendly one?}
{117}{}{I'm just looking for a reason. Gonna give me one?}

{120}{}{Just what the hell are you sneaking around for?}
{121}{}{If you're going to sneak, you're going to have to be a lot quieter than that.}
{122}{}{Oh, aren't you the stealthy one.}
{123}{}{You're good at your work. Uh huh.}
{124}{}{Dumbass, just walk normally.}
{125}{}{Another escapee from the Ministry of Silly Walks.}
{126}{}{I can see you. In fact, I'm crushing your head.}
{127}{}{Does this mean you can't see me, either?}
{128}{}{What was that? This is not a charade. This requires total concentration.}
{129}{}{Uh, are you really trying to be quiet?}

{130}{}{This door leads into a restricted area. You need a Yellow Keycard to get by.}
{131}{}{You need Yellow Authorization to get through here.}
{132}{}{You should talk to Harold if you want a Yellow Keycard.}
{133}{}{No key, no entry.}
{134}{}{Can't go through this door without a Yellow Keycard, guy.}

{140}{}{Glad to see you have authorization.}
{141}{}{Hello, smoothskin.}
{142}{}{If anything goes wrong, we'll know who to blame.}
{143}{}{Better watch it in there. It's a bit hot for your kind.}
{144}{}{Well, that key looks like the right one.}

{150}{}{No key, no entry.}
{151}{}{This is a restricted area.}
{152}{}{Better not be trying anything funny in here.}
{153}{}{You need a Red Keycard to enter this door.}
{154}{}{Better ask Harold for a Red Keycard if you want to get in here.}

{160}{}{You just better watch it in here.}
{161}{}{Welcome to the control area.}
{162}{}{Don't touch anything in there.}
{163}{}{If something goes wrong in there, we'll come looking for you.}
{164}{}{Any problems -- we're blaming you.}

{170}{}{Kinda surprised to see a smoothskin like you here.}
{171}{}{Looks like you're starting to tan a little here.}
{172}{}{Mmm, just love that background leakage -- don't you?}
{173}{}{Don't touch anything in here.}
{174}{}{Keep your hands to yourself and we'll do just fine.}

{180}{}{No taking supplies without authorization.}
{181}{}{You can't take anything out of here without a requisition.}
{182}{}{Talk to Jeremy or Harold if you want something.}
{183}{}{Nothing gets out of here without a requisition.}
{184}{}{No requisition, no part.}

{190}{}{Watch your step here, smoothskin.}
{191}{}{Aren't you worried about the radiation here?}
{192}{}{Just watch your step here.}
{193}{}{If anything goes wrong, we're coming to you first.}
{194}{}{Smile for the security cameras.}

{200}{}{What the hell are you doing with that door?}
{201}{}{Knock it off, and just get out of here.}
{202}{}{Gee, that sure doesn't look like a keycard.}
{203}{}{If you try that again, we're going to have to kill you.}
{204}{}{You have to be even dumber than you look to try that right in front of us.}
