{100}{}{You see a scientist.}
{101}{}{You see Dr. Schreber.}
{102}{}{You see a balding man in a lab coat.}

{103}{}{I hope you have a good reason for interrupting my work, soldier.}
{104}{}{Me want ask questions.}
{105}{}{No, me come back later.}

{106}{}{Very well. I have to live with you grunts so I might as well make
 an effort to get along with you.}
{107}{}{What do you want to know?}
{108}{}{Who you?}
{109}{}{What you do?}
{110}{}{What this place?}
{111}{}{Why room made no sound?}
{112}{}{Why D'claw in other room?}
{113}{}{Why doggie by door no move? No nothing?}
{114}{}{Me got go now.}
{115}{}{Who are you?}
{116}{}{What do you do here?}
{117}{}{What is this place?}
{118}{}{Why is this room soundproofed?}
{119}{}{Why is there a deathclaw in the other room?}
{120}{}{What's with the dog statue by the door?}
{121}{}{I must go now.}

{122}{}{My name is Schreber, Dr. Schreber. I'm the base physician among
 other things. Don't bother with your name, soldier. All of you grunts look
 the same in that armor of yours.}
{123}{}{Okay.}
{124}{}{Got it.}

{125}{}{I work as the base physician but that's just a sideline. Actually,
 I'm a geneticist.}
{126}{}{What that?}
{127}{}{What's a geneticist?}

{128}{}{I really don't think you have the intellectual capacity to
 understand my work, soldier. Let's just say that I can 'customize' people
 or animals.}
{129}{}{Yeah... sure.}
{130}{}{Yeah... I need to ask you a couple more things.}

{131}{}{This was the base med lab. However, I felt that my experiments
 took precedence over the minimal medical needs of the soldiers here so
 I had it converted into a lab.}
{132}{}{How... nice.}
{133}{}{That's nice. So tell me something else.}

{134}{}{Why room made no sound? Oh, you mean the soundproofing! In the
 course of my research I perform... experiments on test subjects.
 Sometimes they get a little vocal. The base commander found this to
 be disturbing so he had the soundproofing installed.}
{135}{}{In the course of my research I perform... experiments on test

{136}{}{Oh...}
{137}{}{I see.}

{138}{}{Big, brown, and ugly? It's an experiment that I've recently
 completed. It's scheduled for termination.}
{139}{}{What termination mean?}
{140}{}{Why are you going to kill it?}

{141}{}{Oh my... Aren't you the bright one? Terminate. Kill, put down,
 put to sleep, make dead. Get it?}
{142}{}{Me got. Why you want kill D'claw?}

{143}{}{The Enclave has been looking for cheap, expendable soldiers.
 We are interested in deathclaws because they have built in armor and
 weapons, and they're mean as hell. They just need to be smarter so
 they can understand commands but not too smart or they could develop
 a will of their own. With me so far?}
{144}{}{Uh... Yeah.}
{145}{}{Yes, I follow you.}

{146}{}{Well, we succeeded! We actually managed to increase their
 intelligence. However, I began to suspect that we went too far.
 That maybe they were a lot smarter than they were letting on. So
 when I was transferred here I brought one of them with me so I
 could put my theory to the test.}
{147}{}{And?}

{148}{}{I was right! The deathclaws have apparently been playing
 dumb, biding their time, and trying to learn as much as they can
 from us. They can even mimic human speech! I've actually had a
 conversation with that fellow in the next room.}
{149}{}{Anyway. The fact that they were capable of conceiving
 this plan and pulling off the deception shows just how dangerous
 they are.}
{150}{}{So what you plan do now?}
{151}{}{So what do you plan to do now?}

{152}{}{I'm going to write a report on my findings and have it
 transmitted to the Enclave. Of course I'll have to recommend the
 extermination of the deathclaw breed. They are much too dangerous
 a threat.}
{153}{}{Me got. Need ask more.}
{154}{}{Uh... You sure room soundproof?}
{155}{}{Me want kill D'claw for you!}
{156}{}{Hey, can I kill the deathclaw for you?}
{157}{}{Interesting. Can I ask you about some other things?}
{158}{}{Say Doc, are you sure this room is soundproof?}

{159}{}{Of course I'm sure. The commander would have a fit otherwise. Why?}
{160}{}{No reason.}
{161}{}{Me not want anyone hear you scream as me kill you!}
{162}{}{I was just curious.}
{163}{}{I don't want anyone to hear your screams as I experiment on you.}

{164}{}{Back again? What can I do for you this time?}
{165}{}{You sure room soundproof?}
{166}{}{Me got more question.}
{167}{}{Nothing. Me say hi.}
{168}{}{Are you sure this room is soundproof?}
{169}{}{I wanted to ask you something else.}
{170}{}{Nothing, I just wanted to say 'Hi' again.}

{171}{}{Of course I'm sure. The commander would have a fit otherwise. Why?}
{172}{}{No reason.}
{173}{}{Me not want anyone hear you scream as me kill you!}
{174}{}{I was just curious.}
{175}{}{I don't want anyone to hear your screams as I experiment on you.}

{176}{}{Be my guest. It's in the next room.}
{177}{}{Thanks!}

{178}{}{That is K-9, my dog. I decided to see if I could cyber
 enhance his intelligence. It worked but he developed a bad case of
 morals. He decided he didn't like my work or me much, and he bit me.}
{179}{}{As punishment I disabled his legs but left him pretty much
 functional otherwise. Now he gets to sit there and watch every
 distasteful thing I do.}
{180}{}{Oh...}
{181}{}{He be fixed?}
{182}{}{I see.}
{183}{}{Can he be fixed?}

{184}{}{Oh yes. I removed his motivator circuit and gave it to
 Raul up in maintenance. It could always be put back in... Maybe
 I'll do that someday just to see if he's changed his attitude.}
{185}{}{Okay.}
{186}{}{All right.}

{187}{}{Are you a civilian?}
{188}{}{This is the med lab. The armory is down the hall on your left.}
{189}{}{Why are you out of uniform?}

{190}{}{Holy shit! We're being invaded! Alert!}
{191}{}{Intruders! Call the guard!}
{192}{}{Guard! Intruders in the med lab!}

{193}{}{What's up? Are we under attack?}
{194}{}{Why the alert? What's happening?}
{195}{}{What the hell's going on?}

{196}{}{I'm not a hostile, don't shoot me.}
{197}{}{I didn't sign up for combat, so leave me alone.}
{198}{}{Damn it! I'm a doctor not a soldier!}

{200}{}{[MORE]}
{201}{}{I wanted to ask you some questions.}
{202}{}{Not right now. Sorry to bother you.}

{800}{}{You killed Doctor Schreber.}
