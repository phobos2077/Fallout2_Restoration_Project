{100}{}{You see trader Bill.}
{101}{}{You see an older looking merchant.}

{200}{}{Hello there, traveler. Name's Bill. What can I get for you?}
{201}{}{Welcome back. Need something else?}
{202}{}{Let's barter.}
{203}{}{I hear you're the man to talk to about caravans.}
{204}{}{Nevermind. Bye.}

{210}{}{Say, I've noticed a lot of old equipment and items have been collected here at the Abbey.
 I don't suppose you've found anything... special, during your time here?}
{211}{}{Heh, so you noticed that, huh? Yeah, the Abbey folks have a bit of a fascination with anything pre-war,
 especially if it's tech related. They've formed some kind of kooky religion around it. I don't quite understand it,
 myself, but they're nice people and they pay good money for anything pre-war I manage to get my hands on. But anyway,
 as for something special... hmm, [He glances over at Marcus.] It's funny you should ask, I just might have something that
 would interest your friend here.}
{212}{}{Heh, so you noticed that, huh? Yeah, the Abbey folks have a bit of a fascination with anything pre-war,

 as for something special... hmm, [He glances over your party.] Sorry, I don't think I have anything special you'd find
 useful right now.}
{213}{}{Oh, well. Let's see what you have in stock instead.}
{214}{}{That's alright. Let me ask you something else.}
{215}{}{Such as?}
{216}{}{You see, a caravan came through here not too long ago, claiming to have come up from the deep south. Said they'd
 been attacked by some of them vile mutants (turning to Marcus) no offense, big guy. Anyway, they did a lot of bragging
 about how they'd wasted all the muties. Claimed there'd been nearly a dozen of 'em, and I called bullshit. But it turns
 out they had some proof.}

#new for RP 1.3
{217}{}{Yeah? What was that?}
{218}{}{A hulking set of mutant armor they'd managed to salvage off one of the corpses. Of course, for all I know, they
 stole it off the bones of some long dead mutie they'd stumbled upon in the wastes, but who knows? Anyway, they weren't
 eager to keep lugging the heavy thing around, so they offered it to me for dirt cheap. I didn't know what I'd ever do
 with it, but I figured a deals a deal.}
#end new and begin reordering
{219}{}{Well, I'm sure Marcus here could benefit from this. How much for it?}
{220}{}{That's interesting. Well, Marcus here is tough enough. I don't think we'll be needing that item. Let me ask you
 something else.}
{221}{}{Well, this bad boy could easily be melted down to make three or four sets of metal armor. Let's say $3000.}
{222}{}{I've got enough for that.}
{223}{}{I think I'll pass for right now. Let me ask you something else.}
{224}{}{Alright then. This is going to take two of us to move this thing, so let me help you fit it to your friend here.}
{225}{}{[Done]}
{226}{}{Hey, this fits nicely!}
#end

{300}{}{I might know a thing or two. What would you like to know?}
{301}{}{How often do you get resupplied?}
{302}{}{Are the caravans hiring?}
{303}{}{On second thought, I have to go.}
{304}{}{I get a new shipment of supplies twice a month. Frankly, I wish they'd come more often, but we're only on a
 minor trade route so I guess this is the best we can get.}
{305}{}{I'm not quite sure. Usually, the ones that stop by here are pretty well equipped and not really interested in
 hanging around very long. But if you're looking to hook up with one of em, I'd head over to Redding or even down to NCR.
 They've got pretty active caravans and good help is always wanted.}
{306}{}{Interesting. I was curious about something else.}
{307}{}{Thanks. Let's barter.}
{308}{}{Well, thanks for the information. See you around.}

{400}{}{Found everything you need?}
{401}{}{Actually, I'd like to take another look at your goods.}
{402}{}{Yes I did. See you around.}
