#Targeting Console Techie

{100}{}{You see a person in funny pajamas. He seems preoccupied.}
{101}{}{You see a Shi submarine technician.}

{150}{}{Uh, what are you doing, sneaking around like that?}
{151}{}{Are you some kind of spy?}

{200}{}{This'd be easier if my Chinese was better...}
{201}{}{I/O error!? How can a guidance system get an I/O error!?}
{202}{}{001100010010011110100001101101110011? Where's my error code chart...}
{203}{}{I wish the IFF database still worked. That'd make things a whole lot easier.}

{300}{}{What do you want, lao wai? Can't you see I'm trying to reconfigure the targeting systems here?}
{301}{}{Actually, that's what I'm here for. I've got new specifications for those systems, checked by the Emperor, uh,
 personally. Can you input them? You seem to be the most knowledgeable about this subsystem.}
{302}{}{That's why I'm here, I can help you with configuring the systems. It seems the connection between the marine
 navigation subsystem and the IFF transponder finally died, so you have to do a workaround. Mind if I help?}
{303}{}{Sorry to bother you.}

{310}{}{Oh, I've been waiting for these new specifications for ages! You should've been here a week ago, though, when I was working on what's left of the battle database. Now I have to bust it open again... Oh well, life of a tech, I guess.}
{311}{}{Have fun. I'll see what else needs fixing.}

{320}{}{I hardly know you! For all I know lao wai, you could be some kind of a foreign spy, wanting to disable this submarine, so that your plan to travel over the seas to strange places can be completed without the torpedoes sinking your boat! I'm sure that Ken Lee wouldn't let a stranger board the Shi-Huang-Ti with bad intentions, so sorry, but I can't accept these coordinates unless I get them from our leader in person.}
{321}{}{Well, can I at least help you with configuring the submarine? I have some experience with ancient computer systems, enough to understand how a 200 year old vacuum lamp system can refuse to obey its master.}
{322}{}{Alright, sorry to bother you.}

{330}{}{I guess I can use your help, here, you try it. [The Shi tech lets you take the input. After a few moments of familiarizing yourself with the UI, you start working. A few minutes later you've not only managed to reconfigure the targeting parameters, so that the sub doesn't sink the tanker, but also remove a fault in the system, preventing the techs from accessing the subsystem easily.]}
{331}{}{Okay, there you go. I've fixed the system. It shouldn't give you any trouble now. Hopefully it'll help you in your work.}

{340}{}{Thank you for your help, it's hard to find a good computer tech these days.}

{350}{}{Sorry, but no. You might break something and we'll lose the subsystem for good and I am *not* going to set the torpedo target acquisition modules by hand. So, unless you have something *important* for me, please let me get back to my work.}
{351}{}{Actually, I do. I have new targeting parameters for the torpedoes, checked with the Emperor, uh, himself. You're the resident computer wizard, so I think I can trust you with this.}
{352}{}{Sorry to bother you.}

{360}{}{No, I don't need any help or any new data. I'm here to work and you are preventing me from working, so go away or I'll have you *taken* away!}
{361}{}{Sorry to bother you.}

{370}{}{Hey, I'm busy here.}
{371}{}{Sorry, I'm working.}

{400}{}{You tricked the technician into disabling the submarine.}
