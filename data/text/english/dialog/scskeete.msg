{100}{}{You see a thin-looking punk.}
{101}{}{It's Doofus, the car hop.}
{102}{}{This guy's a ragged little weed, full twitches and tics, no doubt an addict of something.}
{103}{}{That's a fine transport, man, truly fine! Oh man, I am the one for you - watch your car, keep it safe from the bedbugs. Five bucks, no problem. Five bucks and Doofus is on the job! Never sleep - 24 hour, always there, man.}
{104}{}{I am the car hop, man. I watch cars - $5. Nobody touches them, cause Doofus's on the job.}
{105}{}{Right, sure man.}
{106}{}{So man, you want my protection?}
{107}{}{Good. Do.}
{108}{}{No. You no touch.}
{109}{}{I am not a man!}
{110}{}{What place is this?}
{111}{}{Deal. $5 - you watch the car.}
{112}{}{Get lost, skuzz!}
{113}{}{Whoa man, there's like this giant talking to me! Is that so cool or what?}
{114}{}{Gurg?}
{115}{}{I am not a man!}
{116}{}{What place is this?}
{117}{}{That's right. I'm a really powerful giant! You will obey me.}
{118}{}{Useless junkie - get lost!}
{119}{}{What do you want with Doofus, man?}
{120}{}{Whoa, we met before? What can I do for you?}
{121}{}{Right, sure man.}
{122}{}{Squa?}
{123}{}{I am not a man!}
{124}{}{What do you do?}
{125}{}{What is this place?}
{126}{}{Nothing. Thought you were somebody else. Bye.}
{127}{}{Whoa, man, I warned you. Bad place. Bad folks around here. Heard stuff from your transport got jacked.}
{128}{}{Brak?}

{130}{}{Great. Thanks. Fine.}
{131}{}{Doofus will perform, man. Not even a fly is gonna land his shit on your au-to-mo-bile!}
{132}{}{What is this place?}
{133}{}{Good. Shut up.}
{134}{}{If you ain't got the jack, just get the fuck out of here! I got important things to do.}
{135}{}{Hey man, Doofus warned you.}
{136}{}{Fuck you. I am not answering your questions.}
{137}{}{What is this place?}

{141}{}{Yes?}
{142}{}{No?}
{143}{}{You are a goddamn head case! I'm out of here.}
{144}{}{This is the NCR - the high, mighty, righteous, absolutely and always correct New California Republic. They are the ones who will lead people like us out of the wasteland and into the new and perfect future. Can you dig it?}
{145}{}{Let's get this business finished.}
{146}{}{Yeah, thanks. Goodbye.}
{147}{}{Gurg, ladal spaf!}
{148}{}{TAK!}
{149}{}{Doof? Ganya kulk zar!}
{150}{}{Right - obey the giant, man. It's the way things are supposed to be. What should I do, giant?}
{151}{}{Man that's a lot. Giant, I'm Doofus and I'm a car hop and I'm supposed to watch cars that people bring here, but, you know, I got this... thing, see, and sometimes I need a little extra money and stuff, see?}
{152}{}{Yeah, right. So like sometimes I'm a little short and I got my needs, understand, like when I start feeling sick, so I gotta score me some caps or something, so I'll go talk to Merk.}
{153}{}{Man, Merk's the man. He's got action and stuff. Sometimes he'll let me get sleep at the Rawhide after closing. But then he wants me to do little favors.}
{154}{}{I'm getting to that - wow, the colors, man! Merk he sometimes wants stuff from cars I watch. But I fool him!}
{155}{}{See I only take from the cars I ain't paid to watch. He thinks I'm jacking my customers, but I don't do that. Man, I got to quit talking. I'm like seeing things... oh, man, the glow. It's all about glowing.}
{156}{}{Give me all your stuff.}
{157}{}{Tell me what you know.}
{158}{}{That's enough, I can't take any more.}
{159}{}{Oh, just shut up you dumb shit!}
{160}{}{Bye-bye.}
{161}{}{Oh, you know. Sometimes I hear things. I hear a lot; can't always remember it right.}
{162}{}{$50 bucks says you remember it right.}
{163}{}{Remember or I blow your fucking head off.}
{164}{}{Screw this. I don't have time to waste with a junkie.}
{165}{}{That's right, man. Go see Merk. He's always got things that need doing.}
{166}{}{Go bye-bye!}
{167}{}{Oh man, you blew it! Merk's not going to be happy when he hears this.}
{168}{}{Goodbye, dope-head.}
{169}{}{Okay! Look, it was Merk's crew. They were jacking cars last night. Ask around and you might find them.}
{170}{}{You lie, me kill.}
