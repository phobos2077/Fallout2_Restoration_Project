{100}{}{You see a sharp-dressed guy hawking lizard kebabs.}
{101}{}{It's the lizard-on-a-stick vendor.}
{102}{}{For a lizard-on-a-stick vendor, this guy's got style. He's clean, well-dressed and runs a pretty spotless little operation.}
{103}{}{Hungry, stranger? I got the best lizard around. Ask anybody!}
{104}{}{What can I get you?}
{105}{}{Gimme meat.}
{106}{}{I'll take one.}
{107}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{108}{}{Goodbye.}
{109}{}{Enjoy, stranger!}
{110}{}{There's mustard and onions over there.}
{111}{}{Hey, buddy.}
{112}{}{Yeah, bye.}
{113}{}{Next!}
{114}{}{Look, I got a rule. I don't say nothing about nobody. It's a good rule, because if I keep my mouth shut, I keep out of trouble. Capiche?}
{115}{}{I don't hear nothing, I don't see nothing, and I especially don't say nothing. Now, stop bothering me about that.}
{116}{}{Fine. Look, I'm hungry.}
{117}{}{Do you have a GECK?}
{118}{}{Sorry for troubling you, Christ!}
{119}{}{A GECK? Well, that's old history, so what the hell. You mean the old Garden of Eden Kit. We had one - I mean our grandparents had one. Used it when they came out of Vault 15. Got this place started, they say. It's all used up now.}
{120}{}{I'm still hungry.}
{121}{}{Well, thanks for not much.}
