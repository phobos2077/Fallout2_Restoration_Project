{100}{}{You see an amiable-looking, lean man.}
{101}{}{You see Chad, the caravaneer.}
{102}{}{You see a lean man who wears a smile like a shield. He wears nondescript clothing, and carries
 himself as if he knows what he's doing.}

{120}{}{Howdy, friend! What can I do for you?}
{121}{}{More questions? I'll see what I can do for answers.}
{122}{}{Deerk deegler!}
{123}{}{You who?}
{124}{}{Marcus has been asking a few questions about you.}
{125}{}{There's enough evidence to arrest you for stealing money that's supposed to go to Broken Hills. You're going down.}
{126}{}{There's enough evidence to arrest you for stealing money that's supposed to go to Broken Hills. Cut me in for $1000 and I'll make sure you can flee town.}
{127}{}{Who are you?}
{128}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{129}{}{Nothing. Bye.}

{130}{}{Look what the wasteland dragged in! Sorry, pal, I can't help you.}
{131}{}{Doobye!}

{132}{}{I'm Chad. }
{133}{}{Look, I'm very busy. Please go find someone else to bother.}
{134}{}{I'm the caravan master for the city. I take care of the business on the other end of the trade routes. These days, I'm focusing primarily on Gecko.}
{135}{}{D'okay!}
{136}{}{I'd like to get a job with you.}
{137}{}{Sounds exciting.}
{138}{}{Sounds boring.}
{139}{}{I have more questions.}
{140}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{141}{}{Tell you about Broken Hills? Well... I moved here a few years back. Got a job with the Bill --
 that's the Outfitter -- and moved up to where I am now. I report to Marcus and the Bill, but I'm
 responsible for the livelihood of the town.}
{142}{}{I have more questions.}
{143}{}{Bye.}

{144}{}{Like what?}
{145}{}{He suspects that you're skimming money that's supposed to be going to Broken Hills.}
{146}{}{Nothing really, Bye.}

{147}{}{Look, I don't know anything about that, and I sure as hell don't like it when people accuse me of things. Now I suggest you leave.}

{150}{}{I'm going to find out the truth. Bye.}

{156}{}{Talk to the Bill. He'll help you out.}
{157}{}{I have more questions.}
{158}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{159}{}{Yeah, it is. You wouldn't think it, but I get to travel and see the world... and I feel I
 contribute to the town here. It's a good life.}
{160}{}{Sounds great. I'd like a job like that.}
{161}{}{Actually, that sounds pretty boring.}
{162}{}{I have more questions.}
{163}{}{Bye.}

{164}{}{Probably a hell of a lot more exciting than what you do with your life, jerkoff.}
{165}{}{Yeah, whatever. I have more questions.}
{166}{}{Ha ha ha ha! Right. See ya, loser.}

{167}{}{You'll pay for this someday, you putz.}

{168}{}{Get out of my sight, you jerk.}

{169}{}{You really cocked up that caravan, my friend. So much for your cash.}
{170}{}{You surely screwed the pooch on that caravan, my friend. Good luck ever getting another from Broken Hills.}
{171}{}{Good work on that caravan. Here's your $200.}

{172}{}{Get outta here. Your help ain't wanted no more.}

{173}{}{Keep your eyes peeled.}
{174}{}{I'll watch your back.}
{175}{}{Don't let the bastards sneak up on you.}

{200}{}{I don't know what yer talking about. I suggest you drop this matter before you start to piss people off. Now get outta here.}
{201}{}{I got a better idea. How about I beat you to death instead.}
{202}{}{Wrong answer. Looks like you picked the wrong guy to mess with.}
{203}{}{Fine, goodbye.}
{204}{}{Ah dammit, I knew this wouldn't last forever. [Looks around and lowers his voice.] Alright, listen. Keep your mouth shut about this little matter. Here's $1000 to keep you quiet. [He hands you the money.] Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going.}
{2040}{}{Ah dammit I knew this wouldn't last forever. (Looks around and lowers his voice.) Alright listen. Keep your
 mouth shut about this little matter. Here's $1000 to keep you quiet. [He hands you the money and you hand him his briefcase.]
 Now if you excuse me I have to get going.}
{205}{}{[DONE]}
{206}{}{Help! We have a thief on our hands here.}

{207}{}{}
{208}{}{What the!? Who the hell are you?}
{209}{}{Me? Uh, I'm the tooth fairy. I have come to bring you great riches.}
{210}{}{Yeah and I'm Saint Nick. Now who the fuck are you and why are you in my house?}
{211}{}{Really? I met a guy in New Reno who also claims to be Saint Nick.}
{212}{}{*Stares blankly*}
{213}{}{(going on) Yeah, and then I told him my life story about Arroyo...}
{214}{}{Listen, I don't give a flying fuck about any of your rambling bullshit. You're the one who's been snooping around, asking questions about the missing caravan money.}
{215}{}{That's right. And I'm here to collect the final piece of evidence I need to put you away.}
{216}{}{Oh yeah? Let me help. The documents you're looking for are in a briefcase that's locked away in the bottom drawer
 of that dresser over there. But you're never gonna touch it, 'cause I'm gonna kill you, you fuckin' do-gooder. If it
 weren't for you, I coulda kept skimming off the caravan runs for another couple months. But no, you had to go an'
 meddle in affairs that aren't any of your fuckin' concern. So now I gotta flee town, but at least I'll have the pleasure
 of leaving your corpse behind.}
{217}{}{No one has to die here, Chad. Instead of doing something stupid that might get you killed, you should calm down, and we'll talk this over with Marcus.}
{218}{}{You think I'm stupid? That big ugly prick would lock me up in a second. No, I'm afraid someone's certainly going to die here. And it's not gonna be me!}
{219}{}{I'm here for the last piece of evidence in the caravan skimming case.}
{220}{}{Oh really?...I thought I recognized you.}
{221}{}{Alright, Alright. I admit to everything. I don't want to die for this. Tell Marcus I'll come peacefully.}
{222}{}{Alright, don't move. I'll go get Marcus.}

{300}{}{You allow Chad to skip town.}

{400}{}{Leave me alone.}
