{100}{}{Halt, mutant wastelander! We are searching the area for an enemy of the Enclave. Identify yourself immediately.}
{101}{}{Who are you calling a mutant, asshole? You want an enemy? You've got one -- right here.}
{102}{}{Look, I'm just a simple traveler. I've never even heard of the Enclave. This person you're looking for must be pretty dangerous, because you guys look like you mean business.}

{103}{}{That's enough for me. Kill him.}
{104}{}{Oh, this will be fun!}

{105}{}{Oh yeah, they're dangerous alright, and we suspect them to be fleeing Gecko. For all we know, you're the one we're looking for.}
{106}{}{Well I'm sure glad I'm not, because you don't look like anyone I'd want to mess with. But listen, if there's a dangerous person on the loose around here, I should really be getting back to my family so I can warn them.}
{107}{}{All right, I give up. Let's party!}

{108}{}{You're not going anywhere just yet. Have you ever been to Gecko?}
{109}{}{Yeah, of course I have. Lovely place. I mean, the locals are hideous and it kinda smells and there's all that radiation and stuff, but it sure is fun to mess around on the computers. Ha! You should have been there when I was messing with this one jackass--you know, he looked a lot like you fellas.}
{110}{}{Gecko? Hell no, this is as close as I get. Don't you know that place is full of them ugly-ass ghouls? Why do you ask?}

{111}{}{OK, I believe you. Fan out, men. Search the area. We gotta find this person.}
{112}{}{No. I don't believe you. This is our man, boys!}
{113}{}{No. I don't believe you. This is our woman, boys!}

{114}{}{Whoa! Whoa! Just hold on a second. Why don't you believe me? What am I supposed to have done?}

{115}{}{Somebody hacked into the Enclave computer network from the Poseidon Oil Reactor. We're trying to track him down.}
{116}{}{Hacked into it!? Well, that couldn't have been me. I'm just a tribal. Hell, I don't even know how to use a -- what did you call it? Kom-pu-tor?}

{200}{}{Gecko? Hell no, this is as close as I get. Don't you know that place is full of them ugly-ass ghouls? It's bad enough that I have to watch over my Uncle Lenny, here. Why do you ask?}
{201}{}{Urgh?}
{202}{}{Me kill baddies!}
