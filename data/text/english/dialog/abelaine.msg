{100}{}{You see a stout nun.}
{101}{}{You see Elaine.}
{102}{}{You still see her.}

{200}{}{Greetings!}
{201}{}{Hi, what's your name?}
{202}{}{What can you tell me about the Abbey?}
{203}{}{Bye.}

{300}{}{If you want to know more about our order, talk to the Abbot. You can find him in his quarters on the third floor.}
{301}{}{I see. A few more questions...}

{400}{}{Of course. What would you like to know?}
{401}{}{What is your name?}
{402}{}{Nothing really, bye.}
{403}{}{What can you tell me about the Abbey?}

{500}{}{My name is Elaine.}
{501}{}{I see. A few more questions...}

{600}{}{Hey! Before you go, perhaps you could do me a favor. I'm supposed to bring this machine part to Max in the
 basement copy room. But you see, my left knee has been acting up lately, and it's a real pain for me to go up and down
 all those stairs. Would it trouble you too much to bring him this part for me?}
{601}{}{Sure.}
{602}{}{Sorry, I don't have time for this. Bye.}
{603}{}{Do I look like your personal delivery service? Do it yourself, you fat lazy bitch. Bye.}  #new in RP 1.3

{604}{}{Thanks! Here's the part. The copying room is in the basement. Just use the stairs directly behind Brother Matthew
 in the chapel area.}
{605}{}{Not a problem. [You take the part.] I'll bring it down to Max right away.}

{701}{}{. Who you?}

{710}{}{Hehe. That pretty name.}
{711}{}{Bye!}

{720}{}{You're a special little guy aren't you? Could you do me a BIG favor and be my special helper today?}
{721}{}{You're a special little gal aren't you? Could you do me a BIG favor and be my special helper today?}
{722}{}{Me special. Me help.}
{723}{}{Me no wanna help.}

{730}{}{Really? Great! Please give this machine part to Max in the copying room. He can be found in the BASEMENT. Okay?}
{731}{}{I no let you down!}

{740}{}{You keep on truckin' now.}
