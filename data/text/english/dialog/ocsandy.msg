{100}{}{You see a small girl wearing a yellow dress.}
{101}{}{You see Sandy, the child.}
{102}{}{You see a small girl wearing a yellow dress with flowers on it. She appears to be meowing like
 a cat. She has on a name tag that says "Sandy".}
{103}{}{Meow... meow... I am a cat. And I have special powers that only cats have. What are you?}
{104}{}{Me doggy! Woof! Woof! Who you?}
{105}{}{Urrrh? (confused puppy look)}
{106}{}{You strange. Me gone.}
{107}{}{I'm the person that's gonna kick your ass if you don't stop this cat nonsense and tell me your
 name.}
{108}{}{I'm just a normal person who is quite impressed with your special nature. Can you tell me your
 name?}
{109}{}{Never mind.}
{110}{}{(Giggles) You look funny! Meow... I'm Sandy. I'm not really a cat. I just like to play like I
 am.}
{111}{}{(Screams) Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!}
{112}{}{I'm Sandy. I'm not really a cat, I just like to play.}
{113}{}{Me play too. Me ask you questions?}
{114}{}{Me leave now.}
{115}{}{I see. Can I ask you some questions?}
{116}{}{Okay, I'm history.}
{117}{}{What do you want to ask me?}
{118}{}{You forced stay here?}
{119}{}{You like be here?}
{120}{}{You safe here?}
{121}{}{Never mind. Me leave.}
{122}{}{Are you forced to stay here?}
{123}{}{Do you like it here?}
{124}{}{Are you safe here?}
{125}{}{Never mind. Bye}
{126}{}{Yeah. My mom always tells me where I can and can't go. She tells me where I can play and when
 to eat and when to go to bed and when to go potty and when to go to school and everything. I don't think
 it's fair that she can do anything she wants but I've gotta do what she says all the time.}
{127}{}{Ok.}
{128}{}{Me got leave now.}
{129}{}{I see.}
{130}{}{I think I've heard enough for now. Bye.}
{131}{}{I guess. I miss not having other kids to play with but Mom says that will change some day. She
 thinks other kids will come to live here. Until they do I like to play with Valdis. He's funny and he
 gives me piggy back rides. Mom says I should leave Valdis alone. He's busy and doesn't have time to
 play but he always plays with me when I ask him. I just don't tell Mom about it anymore.}
{132}{}{Piggy... (confused puppy look)}
{133}{}{Me go.}
{134}{}{That's nice.}
{135}{}{Ok, see ya.}
{136}{}{Yeah. Mommy takes care of me and Valdis wouldn't let anyone hurt me. I'm safe here.}
{137}{}{Ok. Me go now.}
{138}{}{Good; I'll be leaving then.}
{139}{}{Hi.}
{140}{}{Go away! I don't like you!}
