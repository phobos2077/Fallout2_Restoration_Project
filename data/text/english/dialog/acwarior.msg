 pants fashioned from animal hides.}
{151}{}{[TALK]}
{152}{}{Hello, Chosen One, can I help you in your quest?}
{153}{}{I'm just looking around the village one last time before I leave.}
{154}{}{What can you tell me of the traders who trade with us?}
{155}{}{Could you tell me where I can find more healing powder?}
{156}{}{Gods give you speed to bring back Eden before it is too late.}
{157}{}{I do have a question for you.}
{158}{}{Goodbye, my friend.}
{159}{}{Oh, you're testing me. Go see Hakunin in the northern corner of the village. He makes our
 medicines.}
{160}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{161}{}{Well, I've seen them when Mynoc has us guard the bridge, but he does all the dealing.
 Talk to him at the Great Bridge.}
{162}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{163}{}{Could tell me where the Great Bridge is located?}
{164}{}{One more question, if I may.}

 you've been there many times.}
{166}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{167}{}{One more question, if I may.}
{168}{}{Of course, what is it?}

{170}{}{What can you tell me of the traders who trade with us?}
{171}{}{Never mind.}
{172}{}{Ah, dull one. They say you are the Chosen One. I must say the spirit
 of the Founder works in strange ways.}
{173}{}{Oon Ga.}
{174}{}{ Have a safe journey, dull one -- for our sake.}
{175}{}{????}
{176}{}{You betray us. You must die.}
{177}{}{A traitor to your own people!}
{178}{}{Why do you do this?}
{179}{}{Death to the evil one!}
{180}{}{They are nothing to us! They scavenge the dying corpse
 of the wastes to live.}
{181}{}{Could you tell me where I can find some healing herbs?}
{182}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{183}{}{One more question, if I may.}
