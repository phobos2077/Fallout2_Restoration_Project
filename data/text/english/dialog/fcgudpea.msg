{100}{}{You see a person in funny pajamas.}
{101}{}{You see a Shi townsperson.}
{102}{}{This person looks different from anyone you've seen before. They don't seem to care much about you.}
{103}{}{You're not a spy, are you?}
{104}{}{Who are you?}
{105}{}{Fish and seaweed. That's all we get.}
{106}{}{Ha ha! Look at the funny round-eyes!}
{107}{}{You look like a Hubologist.}
{108}{}{Leave us in peace.}
{109}{}{Long live the Dragon!}
{110}{}{Down with Lo Pan!}
{111}{}{The Dragon is a hero.}
{112}{}{Look out for Lo Pan. He's trouble.}
{113}{}{Those punks are always so loud.}
{114}{}{Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::}
{115}{}{Isn't there more to life than this?}
{116}{}{We're smarter than you think.}
{117}{}{Look! A lao wai!}
{118}{}{I don't think I like you.}
{119}{}{You scare me.}
{120}{}{Don't hurt me, please.}
{121}{}{I'll bet Lo Pan would like you.}
{122}{}{Please don't cause trouble.}
{123}{}{I like life. I won't do anything to lose it.}
{124}{}{The wastes are getting scarier.}
{125}{}{Sir... yes, sir... goodbye, sir.}
{126}{}{Ha ha! That bastard Lo Pan is dead!}
{127}{}{You've helped us!}
{128}{}{Lo Pan is dead!}
{129}{}{Now for the Hubologists!}
{130}{}{Look at the funny round-eyes!}
{131}{}{You look like a Hubologist.}
{132}{}{Leave us in peace.}
{133}{}{Long live the Dragon!}
{134}{}{Long live the Emperor!}
{135}{}{Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::}
{136}{}{Isn't there more to life than this?}
{137}{}{The Dragon... is dead...}
{138}{}{Oh no! The Dragon is dead!}
{139}{}{Life has no meaning.}
{140}{}{We shall survive... barely.}
{141}{}{Who will be our hero now?}
{142}{}{And with the Dragon go our dreams.}
{143}{}{There's no point.}
{144}{}{Let us teach our children to be like the Dragon.}
{145}{}{We must make new dreams now.}
{146}{}{The Emperor's mouthpiece! Dead!}
{147}{}{What happens now?}
{148}{}{I hope the savages don't overrun us now!}
{149}{}{The good always die young.}
{150}{}{I hope we can survive the winter without Ken Lee.}
{151}{}{I hear that Ken Lee was the only one who kept the Emperor in line.}
{152}{}{I hear that the Emperor was only a façade for Ken Lee. }
{153}{}{Work, work, work. Rice, rice, rice. ::sigh::}
{154}{}{Isn't there more to life than this?}
{155}{}{We're smarter than you think.}
{156}{}{Look! An outsider!}

{164}{}{You killed AHS-9? Good job!}
{165}{}{Those Hubologists give me the creeps.}
{166}{}{Honored visitor, you have done us a great service.}
{167}{}{Death to the Hubologists!}
{168}{}{Maybe this will hurry those Hubologists out of here.}
{169}{}{Stupid Hubologists, can't even protect their own leader.}
{170}{}{I just hope the Hubologists don't come after us in revenge.}
{171}{}{I guess you're not a spy after all.}
{172}{}{Son of a pig! Die!}
{173}{}{You have dishonored your family!}
{174}{}{Leave us alone, lao wai!}
{175}{}{Haven't you done enough damage?}
{176}{}{I hate you!}
{177}{}{Leave this city!}
{178}{}{Go home to your people!}
{179}{}{Do not darken my life with your face!}
{180}{}{What will it take to get rid of you?}
{181}{}{Help! Help!}
