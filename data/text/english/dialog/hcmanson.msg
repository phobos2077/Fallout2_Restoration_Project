{100}{}{You see a scruffy man in worn-down clothing.}
{101}{}{You see Manson, one of the local hate militia.}
{102}{}{You see a young man with a scraggly beard, tattered clothing, and an insane yet somehow
 trusting gleam in his eye.}

{103}{}{What?!}
{104}{}{Duhhh... gabba gabba hey?}
{105}{}{I knyou bars?}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{Why are you in jail?}
{108}{}{Tell me about Broken Hills.}
{109}{}{Nothing. Forget it.}

{110}{}{Don't understand that freaky stupid-person talk. You just get on outta here 'fore ya make me
 stupid too.}
{111}{}{Oh!}

{112}{}{Manson. Rebel 'gainst society.}
{113}{}{What are you rebelling against?}
{114}{}{Yeah! Fight the power!}
{115}{}{Loser in society, more like.}
{116}{}{Manson?}
{117}{}{I ... see. Bye!}

{118}{}{I'm here cuz me and Franc were working against what society wants us to believe.}
{119}{}{And that is...}
{120}{}{Yeah! Fight the power!}

{121}{}{Broken Hills? Lived here all my life. That's how I know all the bad stuff that goes on here.
 That's why I know how evil the mutants all are. It's a good thing there are some of us who see the
 truth.}
{122}{}{Yeah, I'll say. Fight the power, huh?}
{123}{}{You're seeing hatred, and that's not the truth.}
{124}{}{Perhaps you ought to realize that the only blinders you have are the ones you allow other
 people to put on you, and that preaching the politics of hatred only makes you look more stupid.}
{125}{}{Yeah. Bye.}

{126}{}{Society wants us to believe that humans and mutants are meant to live together. But the mutants
 are out to kill us! At least, that's what Franc says.}
{127}{}{You really like Franc, huh?}
{128}{}{That's gotta be the dumbest thing I ever heard.}
{129}{}{All right. Bye.}

{130}{}{That's right! We gotta... umm... think for ourselves! That's what Franc and Jacob always say!}
{131}{}{Wow, you really suck up to those two. Why not try thinking for yourself instead of parroting
 what other people tell you?}
{132}{}{You really like Franc, huh?}
{133}{}{Bye.}

{134}{}{What would you know, you jerk? Get the hell out of here before you get hurt!}

{135}{}{Back in the olden days, there was a guy who told us all we hadda think fer ourselves. My mom
 and dad said he was related to me. He died in prison, but he was really influential to me. People said
 he was really smart. I think they were right. I mean, look at me!}
{136}{}{Umm... yeah. Look at you.}
{137}{}{You? Smart? Ha!}
{138}{}{Sure. Bye.}

{139}{}{Wha'?}
{140}{}{Nothing.}

{141}{}{Yeah, I think he's one of the wisest people I ever knew. Jacob's smart, but he ain't as
 straight up as Franc.}
{142}{}{Franc's just a virulent scumbag. He won't get you anywhere.}
{143}{}{Yeah, I've met him. He's a good guy.}
{144}{}{Haven't met the guy. No opinion on him.}
{145}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{146}{}{What else you want?}
{147}{}{Who are you?}
{148}{}{Why are you in jail?}
{149}{}{Tell me about Broken Hills.}
{150}{}{You like Franc?}
{151}{}{Why are you called Manson?}
{152}{}{Why are you so stupid?}
{153}{}{Nothing. Forget it.}

{154}{}{You're with us? Then get us out of here!}
{155}{}{I'm working on it. See ya.}

{156}{}{Thanks for the help. Knew we could count on a fellow human to see the light!}
{157}{}{Yep. I'm good like that.}

{158}{}{So what else can I do for ya?}
{159}{}{I'm curious about your plans now.}
{160}{}{What's your name mean?}
{161}{}{Nothing. Just looking around.}

{162}{}{Now we destroy the mine while the mutants are inside. The ones that're left, we mop up by hand.}
{163}{}{I want in.}
{164}{}{Count me out.}
{165}{}{Cool. Good luck.}

{166}{}{Well, people think he was a band guy or something. But the Manson I'm named after started a
 religion and got killed because of it. He was a martyr. Maybe I'll be one, too.}
{167}{}{Sounds... fascinating. Anyway...}

{168}{}{You'll have to talk to Jacob about that. I'm sure that with your jailbreak, he'll want you.}
{169}{}{Cool. See ya.}

{170}{}{I wanted to work with ya. Oh well. See ya!}

{171}{}{You jerk! We trusted you to help us!}

{172}{}{Wow... you can kill like nobody's business. And now we're free of the mutants. That's soooo cool!}

{173}{}{We're gettin' outta town. You probably oughta too... the muties will be looking for scapegoats.}

{174}{}{We'll follow you.}

{175}{}{You preached open-mindedness to Manson.}

{176}{}{We wuz framed! We wuz framed!}

{177}{}{Thanks for your help, friend. Let's go talk to Jacob and Aileen.}

{178}{}{You have successfully performed the jailbreak.}

{179}{}{Good luck at the mine, brother.}
