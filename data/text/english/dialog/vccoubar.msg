{100}{}{You see a bartender.}
{101}{}{You see a tall man in an elegant suit. He is staring straight ahead and paying no attention to the patrons around him.}
{102}{}{You see a bartender.}
{103}{}{This man looks stone-faced. If he notices you, he shows no sign.}
{104}{}{Care for a drink, hero?}
{105}{}{Welcome, hero. Please, take a seat in the bar.}
{106}{}{Please! Take a seat, rest for a while!}
{107}{}{Good day, Captain.}
{108}{}{Vault City prevails, Captain.}
{109}{}{Good day, Citizen.}
{110}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{111}{}{A mutant! Guards! Guards!}
{112}{}{A ghoul! Guards! Guards!}
{113}{}{I'm sorry, but the bar is closed for the evening.}
{114}{}{The bar is closed. I'll be returning home once I finish this inventory list.}
{115}{}{Don't you have homes to go to?}
{116}{}{Welcome! We've all heard about your exploits against the Enclave. Can I get you something to drink?}
{117}{}{Awnt-awnt}
{118}{}{Shamble off}
{119}{}{What's on tap?}
{120}{}{I was looking for some information.}
{121}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{122}{}{Heh-heh, "awnt-awnt" to you, too. Please be careful out in the wastes.}
{123}{}{Oonnt-oooont!}
{124}{}{Shamble off}
{125}{}{What can I do for you, Captain?}
{126}{}{What can I do for you, Citizen?}
{127}{}{Yes? Can I help you?}
{128}{}{Awnt-awnt}
{129}{}{Shamble off}
{130}{}{What's on tap?}
{131}{}{I was looking for some information.}
{132}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{133}{}{Yes, "awnt-awnt" to you, too. Hold on a moment while I summon the guards to "awnt-awnt" you to the front gate.}
{134}{}{Urnt? Urnt-urnt.}
{135}{}{Shamble off}
{136}{}{"On tap?" How... quaint.}
{137}{}{We have mineral water, distilled water, and sparkling water. We also have several synthesized alcohols.}
{138}{}{Um... what synthesized alcohols do you have?}
{139}{}{Uh, do you have any real drinks?}
{140}{}{Some water would be great.}
{141}{}{Never mind. I was looking for some information.}
{142}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{143}{}{Very good, sir.}
{144}{}{Very good, ma'am.}
{145}{}{Which would you like? Mineral? Distilled? Or Sparkling? Each is modestly priced at five dollars a glass.}
{146}{}{Mineral, please.}
{147}{}{I'll try some of that distilled water.}
{148}{}{Set me up with some of that sparkling water.}
{149}{}{What synthesized alcohols do you have?}
{150}{}{Never mind. I was looking for some information.}
{151}{}{That's a little steep for me. I'll come back when I have more money.}
{152}{}{I think I'll pass, thanks.}
{153}{}{We have synthetic derivatives H and T, and we recently brewed an extremely popular mixture, "Alcohol-Z," which has a rich pseudo micro-brewery flavor. Each is modestly priced at twenty dollars a glass.}
{154}{}{How do you manufacture these synthesized alcohols?}
{155}{}{Uh, do you have any real drinks?}
{156}{}{I'll just have some water, I think.}
{157}{}{Hmmm. I'll try some of that delicious alcohol-Z.}
{158}{}{Nevermind. I was looking for some information.}
{159}{}{That's a little steep. I'll come back when I have more money.}
{160}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{161}{}{Would you care for anything else?}
{162}{}{I'd like some more water, thanks.}
{163}{}{What synthesized alcohols do you have?}
{164}{}{Never mind. I was looking for some information.}
{165}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{166}{}{Are you okay, sir? Drinking all that "alcohol-Z" looks like it has had some sort of effect on you. Are you sure you want more?}
{167}{}{Are you okay, sir? Drinking all that "alcohol-Z" looks like it has had some sort of effect on you. Are you sure you want more?}
{168}{}{Would you care for anything else?}
{169}{}{I don't feel so good... I'm just going to pop out of dialogue for a second and check my max hit points.}
{170}{}{No, no, I feel great! I'm just going to pop out of dialogue for a second and check my max hit points.}
{171}{}{I'll just have some water, I think.}
{172}{}{I'll have some more delicious alcohol-Z.}
{173}{}{How do you manufacture these synthesized alcohols?}
{174}{}{Actually, I was looking for some information.}
{175}{}{Nothing more today, thanks.}
{176}{}{The Auto-Docs within Vault City can brew synthetic substitutes for otherwise addictive substances. As I understand it, these synthetics were used as placebos for drug addicts before the war.}
{177}{}{You seem to know a great deal about these synthetics.}
{178}{}{Uh, do you have any real drinks?}
{179}{}{Oh. Well, I'd just like some water then.}
{180}{}{Hmmm. I'll try some of that alcohol-Z.}
{181}{}{Interesting. Say, I was looking for some information...}
{182}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Good-bye.}
{183}{}{I was a servant to Dr. Troy for a few months before being re-assigned here. He required that I be fluent with the Vault City medical database.}
{184}{}{"Fluent?" Can he legally ask you to do that to a computer?}
{185}{}{Medical database?}
{186}{}{Interesting. Say, I was looking for some information...}
{187}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Good-bye.}
{188}{}{Uh..."fluent" means proficient, skilled, well-learned.}
{189}{}{Huh. Well, if that makes you feel better to put it that way, fine. What was this about a medical database?}
{190}{}{I was looking for some other information...}
{191}{}{If denial makes you feel better, I understand. I'll talk to you later.}
{192}{}{Yes, several of the computers on the first floor of the Vault contain a vast array of medical information. It's all quite fascinating, though the jargon can be confusing if you don't have medical training.}
{193}{}{Jargon? Is he the one in charge of the computers?}
{194}{}{Interesting. Say, I was looking for some information...}
{195}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe I'll go check them out, then.}
{196}{}{Uh, no. "Jargon" refers to lingo, terminology, usually related to a particular profession.}
{197}{}{Uh, sure it does, sure it does. Just testing you. Say, I was looking for some information...}
{198}{}{If you say so. Just let this Jargon guy know that I'll be speaking to him, all right? Goodbye.}
{199}{}{If you mean what passes for alcohol in the wastes, then no.}
{200}{}{We have never felt the need to poison our systems with those bacterial-ridden mixtures. The bar in the Courtyard might be less... discriminating.}
{201}{}{I'll just have some water, then.}
{202}{}{Wait a minute. What 'synthesized drinks' do you have?}
{203}{}{I was looking for some information.}
{204}{}{I'll go check it out then, thanks.}
{205}{}{Maybe I'll go somewhere else, then.}
{206}{}{Then perhaps you should be at our information center instead of this establishment. It is located downtown. Now move along... I have other customers.}
{207}{}{Hold on, I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{208}{}{No, I think you'll tell me what I want to know first. And you'll leave that attitude out of your voice, too if you know what's good for you.}
{209}{}{All right then. Good day.}
{210}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, sir?}
{211}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, ma'am?}
{212}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, Captain?}
{213}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, Citizen?}
{214}{}{Can you tell me who Vault City's leader is?}
{215}{}{Can you tell me a little about the slavery here in Vault City?}
{216}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{217}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{218}{}{Why, First Citizen Lynette, of course. She's been First Citizen for almost two terms now. She is still answerable to the council, but she is responsible for most of the core legislation for Vault City.}
{219}{}{Council?}
{220}{}{Can you tell me a little about the slavery here in Vault City?}
{221}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{222}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{223}{}{Yes, there is also a Vault City council. Its spokesman is Senior Councilman McClure. (Leans in.) McClure and the First Citizen have butted heads several times, in fact.}
{224}{}{Really...?}
{225}{}{Can you tell me a little about the slavery here in Vault City?}
{226}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{227}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{228}{}{Oh, yes. Recently, some Citizens have petitioned McClure and the council to override some of the First Citizen's decisions. It created quite a stir, let me tell you.}
{229}{}{Hmmm. I was curious about something else...}
{230}{}{I see. Well, I could use a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{231}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{232}{}{Oh, no, no... it's not slavery. Those people you see working in the city are servants... myself included. We are treated very well here, taught to read and write, and given medical care, homes and food.}
{233}{}{Everything except your freedom, huh?}
{234}{}{If you've no complaints, then it's no problem. Forget I asked.}
{235}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{236}{}{I see. Well, thanks for talking with me. Goodbye.}
{237}{}{If you are not going to order a drink, perhaps you had best leave, ma'am.}
{238}{}{If you are not going to order a drink, perhaps you had best leave, sir.}
{239}{}{If you've no complaints about your... servitude, then it's no problem. Forget I asked.}
{240}{}{I'll take a drink, then. What have you got on tap?}
{241}{}{Maybe I better. Good day.}
{242}{}{I shall. Now is there something I can help you with?}
{243}{}{I'll take a drink, then. What have you got on tap?}
{244}{}{Not today, actually. Good day.}
{245}{}{Zzzzzz.}
