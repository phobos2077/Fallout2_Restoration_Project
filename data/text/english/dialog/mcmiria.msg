{100}{}{Oh my! A very shapely and seductive looking woman.}
{101}{}{You see Miria.}
{102}{}{You're not sure, but the measurements 36-24-36 come to mind.}

{150}{}{Bitch!}
{151}{}{How dare you show your face around here!}

{152}{}{That's just sick!}
{153}{}{I hope you two are happy together.}

# Node 0
{154}{}{Why, hello there, stranger. I'm Miria.}
{155}{}{I am so pleased you came back. What can I DO for you now?}
{156}{}{What do you do around here?}
{157}{}{What can you tell me about the slaughterhouse?}
{158}{}{Heard any good rumors?}
{159}{}{Hubba! Hubba!}

# Node 2
{160}{}{If I weren't so bored, I'd say no. So ask away.}

# Node 10
{164}{}{Rumor has it that Farrel stole the watch.}
{165}{}{Why would Farrel steal the watch?}
{166}{}{Isn't Farrel Cornelius's best friend?}
{167}{}{Tell me some more rumors.}

# Node 11
{168}{}{Because poor people tend to steal to make ends meet. Farrel definitely falls in the poor
 category, and that would explain the new tools he bought soon after Cornelius's watch disappeared.}
{170}{}{Can I ask you a few more questions?}

# Node 12
{171}{}{Yes, they were thick as thieves, those two. Which is why I think Farrel stole the watch. Who
 else but Farrel would have the access and the opportunity to steal Cornelius's watch?}

# Node 13
{174}{}{Nothing to tell. My family runs the slaughterhouse. People from all around bring their brahmin
 here for slaughter. After they are slaughtered and the meat treated, it is sold to traders who in turn
 sell it to merchants in various towns. All very boring, if you ask me.}

# Node 14
{176}{}{Have you come to the right place! This town is so boring, there's nothing else to do but gossip
 and... [She keeps talking for awhile and sometime later you're able to get a word in.]}
{177}{}{What else do you want to know?}
{178}{}{What do you know about the Cornelius's missing watch?}
{179}{}{You mentioned something about Rose?}
{180}{}{What's this about a mutated brahmin?}
{181}{}{Tell me about Davin.}
{182}{}{Let's talk about something else.}

# Node 15
{183}{}{Ah, Rose. The proprietor of Rose's Bed and Breakfast. Now, you didn't hear it from
 me, but have you ever wondered why her 'coop' is so well protected? She says it's to
 protect her chickens from predators, but if you look closely it looks as if she's
 trying to keep something in rather than out. Plus, whoever heard of chickens laying twelve pound
 eggs?}
{184}{}{Tell me more rumors.}

# Node 16
{186}{}{It's really strange, but I hear some ranchers say that every once in a while a brahmin will
 give birth to a calf with only one head. Talk about weird!}

# Node 17
{189}{}{He's family; I don't spread rumors about my own family.}

# Node 18
{192}{}{Who, me? I do odd jobs here and there. Surely nothing worth talking about. [She flutters her
 eyes at you.]}
{193}{}{I really would like to know more about you.}
{194}{}{You're right, enough talk. Let's get it on! You know you want it.}

# Node 19
{196}{}{I'm really touched. Nobody ever tries to get to know me better. All they want is sex, sex, sex!
 I get so tired of having wild sex all the time. I'm so glad you're not like the others.}
{197}{}{You slut! I thought you were special for a moment.}
{198}{}{You know, I'm just a normal guy like everyone else. Why, my friends say, "}
{199}{}{ you're just so cool because you're normal just like everyone else." Yep, normal that's me.}
{200}{}{Well, I've never known anyone as interesting as you are.}

# Node 20
{202}{}{Want what? Just what are you implying?}
{203}{}{I think you know what I'm talking about, baby. You know this is what you want. [You smile and
 start to undress.]}
{204}{}{Forget it; I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.}

# Node 21
{205}{}{How dare you call me a slut! Let me tell you, I am very picky about the people I sleep with.
 Why, I have only slept with 10 or 20 people this month! I think this conversation is over!}

# Node 22
{206}{}{How disappointing. You are just like everyone else, aren't you?}

# Node 23
{208}{}{No. I don't think so. I'm tired of this conversation. Good bye.}

# Node 24
{209}{}{[She blushes] Stop, you're embarrassing me. You are just the sweetest thing. Why don't come
 over here and sit by me.}
{210}{}{I think this going too far. Can't we just talk?}
{211}{}{I thought you'd never ask. Why don't we get a little more comfortable?}
{212}{}{All right! You know what I want, baby!}
{213}{}{You are a slut, aren't you!}

# Node 25
{214}{}{I can't take this anymore! You're perfect. [She rips off her clothes, your clothes, and then...]}
{215}{}{[Your world will never be the same again.]}

# Node 26
{216}{}{That better not mean what I think that means.}
{217}{}{Aoooga!}
{218}{}{Urg?}

# Node 27
{219}{}{Yup! That's what I thought. It's funny how Neanderthal and civilized speech crosses roads on
 this subject. [You don't even see it coming. But you're sure the red hand print on your face will
 disappear someday.]}
