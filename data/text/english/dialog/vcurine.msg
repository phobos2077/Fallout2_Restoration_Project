{100}{}{You see a Vault Citizen.}
{101}{}{You see a Citizen in a bright blue jumpsuit relieving himself.}
{102}{}{I'd clap right now, but my hands are occupied.}
{103}{}{Uh, congratulations on defeating the Enclave. Did you catch them all in the bathroom, too?}
{104}{}{I'd rather hear about your exploits when I'm not peeing, thanks.}
{105}{}{Out! Out, damn pee! Out!}
{106}{}{Knew I shouldn't have had so much synthetic alcohol.}
{107}{}{I feel like I've been in here forever.}
{108}{}{Ahhhhhhhh.}
{109}{}{I feel exposed. Like someone's watching me from above.}
{110}{}{Nothing like a satisfying urinating experience.}
{111}{}{Don't distract m... dammint! My pant leg!}
{112}{}{Don't talk. It makes it crawl back up.}
{113}{}{Look, "Chosen One," I'm trying to concentrate here, okay?}
{114}{}{Wish this place had a stall.}
{115}{}{People who talk in the bathroom have a lot to learn about evacuation etiquette.}
{116}{}{I think you've mistaken me for someone who ISN'T PEEING!}
{117}{}{Is this one of those Kevin and Bean bathroom interviews?}
{118}{}{Who does Number Two work for?!?!}
{119}{}{I knew communal bathrooms weren't a good idea.}
{120}{}{Not now, sweetheart. In case you didn't notice, I'm urinating.}
{121}{}{Sorry, honey. Bathrooms don't do it for me.}
{122}{}{This isn't a rest area, pal. Move along, okay?}
{123}{}{I think you've mistaken me for someone who wants to meet men like you in the bathrooms.}
{124}{}{No, I'm not going to give you instructions on how to use the toilet.}
{125}{}{A mutant! Guards! Guards!}
{126}{}{A ghoul! Guards! Guards!}
{127}{}{Hey! Stop pushing! Wait your turn!}
{128}{}{There's another toilet! Use that one!}
{129}{}{Push me again, and I'll pee on you. Understand? No, really!}
