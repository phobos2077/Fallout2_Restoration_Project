{100}{}{You see a chemistry set.}
{101}{}{You see a Li'l Chemist.}
{102}{}{You see a Li'l Chemist, a chemistry set that allows you create interesting concoctions.}

{103}{}{Where do you want to start? You have four liquids in vials: Red, blue, yellow, and clear.}
{104}{}{Red.}
{105}{}{Blue.}
{106}{}{Yellow.}
{107}{}{Clear.}
{108}{}{Make nothing.}

{109}{}{You select the red. What do you want to mix it with?}
{110}{}{Blue. This will make Purple.}
{111}{}{Yellow. This will make Orange.}
{112}{}{Clear. This will make Red.}
{113}{}{Drink it.}
{114}{}{Blue. This, you know, will make Jet, an addictive amphetamine-like drug... if you get the correct
 dosages.}
{115}{}{Yellow. Your scientific mind realizes this will, if successfully mixed, make hydrochloric acid.}
{116}{}{Clear. Your trained eye knows that this will make a powerful vitamin... but only if you measure
 the correct amounts.}
{117}{}{Stop now.}

{118}{}{You select the blue. What do you want to mix it with?}
{119}{}{Red. This will make Purple.}
{120}{}{Yellow. This will make Green.}
{121}{}{Clear. This will make Blue.}
{122}{}{Red. This, you know, will make Jet, an addictive amphetamine-like drug... if you get the correct
 dosages.}
{123}{}{Yellow. Before you mix it, you calculate the solution in your head. You know that it will make
 nitroglycerine, an explosive.}
{124}{}{Clear. This will make a toxic chemical that is good for nothing but mimicking the effects of
 radiation.}
{125}{}{Drink it.}
{126}{}{Stop now.}

{127}{}{You select the yellow. What do you want to mix it with?}
{128}{}{Blue. This will make Green.}
{129}{}{Red. This will make Orange.}
{130}{}{Clear. This will make Yellow.}
{131}{}{Drink it.}
{132}{}{Blue. Before you mix it, you calculate the solution in your head. You know that it will make
 nitroglycerine, an explosive.}
{133}{}{Yellow. Your scientific eye realizes this will, if successfully mixed, make hydrochloric acid.}
{134}{}{Clear. You know that this will create a weak poison if you continue. }
{135}{}{Stop now.}

{136}{}{You select the clear liquid. What do you want to mix it with?}
{137}{}{Blue, to make blue.}
{138}{}{Red, to make red.}
{139}{}{Yellow, to make yellow.}
{140}{}{Drink it.}
{141}{}{Yellow. You know that this will create a weak poison if you continue. }
{142}{}{Blue. This will make a toxic chemical that is good for nothing but mimicking the effects of
 radiation.}
{143}{}{Red. Your trained eye knows that this will make a powerful vitamin... but only if you measure
 the correct amounts.}
{144}{}{Stop now.}

{145}{}{You've managed to create an interesting purple liquid. What do you want to do with it?}
{146}{}{Drink it.}
{147}{}{Put it in my inventory.}

{148}{}{Hmmm. An interesting orange color. What are you going to do with it?}
{149}{}{Drink it.}
{150}{}{Put it in my inventory.}

{151}{}{A strong red color. What now?}
{152}{}{Drink it.}
{153}{}{Put it in my inventory.}

{154}{}{A sickly shade of green results. What now?}
{155}{}{Drink it.}
{156}{}{Put it away.}

{157}{}{This is an interesting shade of blue. What are you going to do?}
{158}{}{Drink it.}
{159}{}{Save it for later.}

{160}{}{This yellow looks like urine and smells worse. What are you gonna do?}
{161}{}{Drink it.}
{162}{}{Save it. It might be useful.}

{163}{}{Ahh, sweet success. You've manufactured Jet. You could be very popular in New Reno with this.
 What are you going to do with it?}
{164}{}{Drink it.}
{165}{}{Save it to use on some unsuspecting sap.}

{166}{}{Uh oh! You've created some weird toxic fume! You catch a whiff of it and you're out flat. You
 feel like shit.}
{167}{}{[DONE]}

{168}{}{This stuff looks potent. What are you going to do with it?}
{169}{}{Drink it.}
{170}{}{Save it for later.}

{171}{}{Oh no! You mixed it too strong! It eats through the bottle and onto your hand! Ouch!}

{172}{}{You've successfully created an explosive formula!}
{173}{}{Drink it.}
{174}{}{Put it in my inventory.}

{175}{}{A jiggle here, a joggle there, and... uh-oh... BOOM!}

{176}{}{Oh no! You idiot! You've just swallowed an explosive formula!}

{177}{}{You feel a little funny. No, you feel a lot funny. In fact, you feel like your heart is
 speeding up and the world is slowing down and you don't know what's happening and can't someone help
 you because you don't know what this is oh no look out! AAAAAAH! YOU'RE FREAKING OUT!!!}

{178}{}{You grimace at the taste and then realize that it's burning you all the way down. Ouch. OUCH.
 OUCH!! It's breaking apart your insides! }

{179}{}{It's a little chalky, but you manage to choke it down. Oddly, you feel a little better now.}

{180}{}{Ahh, what the hell. Despite the looks of it, you down the nasty brew. You immediately begin
 spitting and gagging. You've been irradiated!}
{181}{}{[DONE]}

{182}{}{Well... all right. Reminiscing of the things you drank as a child, you tilt the
 bottle back and let it flow. Your stomach knots up as the fluid hits it. You feel like you've just
 been stung by a radscorpion.}

{183}{}{Hey, it looks like water, so it must be as good, huh? As soon as the stuff hits your throat,
 you realize you've made a mistake. This stuff BURNS. You're in pain for a long, long time.}

{184}{}{A little of this, a little of that... wait a second... why is the bottle smoking... what's going
 wrong? OH NO! The bottle explodes in your face!}

{185}{}{You mix the stuff together gleefully, hoping you've created the right mix of chemicals. Then
 you sit and wait for your payoff. And you wait. And you wait. The liquid turns to a dull, sludgy
 brown. It's wasted.}

{186}{}{You've managed to create a potent vitamin. What do you want to do with it?}
{187}{}{Drink it.}
{188}{}{Save it for later.}

{189}{}{You've created a toxin! All right! What now?}
{190}{}{Drink it.}
{191}{}{Save it for later.}

{192}{}{You have successfully created a formula that simulates the effects of radiation poisoning. What
 would you like to do with it?}
{193}{}{Drink it.}
{194}{}{Save it for later.}
