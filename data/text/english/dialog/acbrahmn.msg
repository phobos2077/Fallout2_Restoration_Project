{100}{}{You see a regular domesticated brahmin.}
{101}{}{The brahmin's extra head is probably the result of a regular
 cow being exposed too soon to radiation.}
{102}{}{You don't notice anything unusual about the brahmin.}
{103}{}{Brahmin aren't much for conversations.}
{104}{}{Don't you have anything better to do than sit around
 talking to a two-headed cow?}
{105}{}{Brahmin are a mutated breed of cows.}
