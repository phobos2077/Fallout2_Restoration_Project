{409}{}{There's a little more to me than my legs, Stuart. So be polite, or else you're going to have even more trouble getting
 a date in this town, all right?}
{410}{}{Actually, I was just looking around. Catch you later, Stuart.}
{411}{}{(Sticks toothpick back in mouth, chews on it.) Got a name?}

{1431}{}{! What's up? Ready to get back in the ring?}
{432}{}{(Stuart sneers as you approach.) Well, if it ain't "}

{435}{}{I'm reeeeeeady to rumble.}
{436}{}{Give me another chance, Stuart. I can GO the distance! C'mon...}
{437}{}{Nothing. Just looking around.}

# 25. OFFER TO BOX, PC DOESN'T MATCH UP (23, 33)
{440}{}{You wanna BOX? Uh... awright, let me level with you, kid. You just don't look like you
 have the frame for it.}
{441}{}{You wanna BOX? Awright, now I've heard it all. Look, most job opportunities in Reno for women are... hmmm.
 Well, from the looks of it, maybe those jobs weren't cut out for you.}
{442}{}{You wanna BOX? Awright, now I've heard it all. Look, not to be mean or nothing, it's just that boxing is an
 UGLY sport... and it makes people in it ugly, too. In your case, that would be a damn shame.}
{444}{}{Give me a chance, and I'll forget that LITTLE crack you just made.}
{445}{}{Give me a chance, Stuart.}
{446}{}{Oh, forget this brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}

# 26. CHANCE (FAIL) (25)
{450}{}{No, sorry, honey, too much of a risk... chances are, they wouldn't even let you fight. Now get
 on home, 'kay?}
{451}{}{No, sorry, pal, too much of a risk... it'd be a massacre. Now get on home, 'kay?}
{452}{}{There aren't any woman boxers, Stuart, and that's my point. You'll be the first agent sponsoring a woman boxer. People will
 come in DROVES to see it.}
{453}{}{But that's just it, Stu... I can call you Stu, can't I?...it WOULD be a massacre. Do you know how much attention that would
 grab? It'd be like going to see an execution!}
{454}{}{Oh, this is brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}

# 27. CHANCE (FAIL AGAIN) (25, 26, 27)
{460}{}{No, sorry, honey, too much of a risk... chances are, they wouldn't even let you fight. Now get
 on home, 'kay?}
{461}{}{No, sorry, pal, it wouldn't even be an entertaining massacre. Now get on home, 'kay?}
{462}{}{It's a risk, sure... but you know, Stuart, I could *dress down* a little in the ring. Might draw more of a crowd than you're
 used to...}
{463}{}{Oh, this is brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}

# 28. STRONG FELLA, AGREES (23, 25, 26, 27, 33)
{470}{}{Hmmmmm... awright, I'll give you a chance... but I ain't promising anything. This hurts business,
 even a little, and you're out. (Puts his hands on hips.) My take is half the winnings, no arguments.}
{471}{}{Hmmmmm... I'll give you a chance... but I ain't promising anything; I'm doing you a favor
 taking some unknown under my wing. My take is half the winnings... no arguments.}
{472}{}{Done.}
{473}{}{Cut your take down to 25%, and we got a deal.}
{474}{}{Oh, this is brahmin shit. I'm out of here.}

# 29. WE'VE REACHED AN AGREEMENT (28)
{480}{}{(Stuart's frown deepens. He looks like he is about to protest, then he shakes his head with a smirk.) All right already!
 Now if yer ALL done whittling away my livelihood, let's talk management.}
{481}{}{Okay...}

# 30. YOU'RE GONNA NEED A HANDLE (28, 29, 32)
{490}{}{Awright... (Stuart looks you over.) Yer gonna need a name, y'know, a handle. Something that sounds tough. Mean. Like }
{1490}{}{ the Hurricane, }
{2490}{}{ the Brawler, y'know.}

# 31. SPECIAL HANDLE (30)
{500}{}{(The midget frowns.) Didn't he die against that Russian guy way back when? Aw, whatever. Shall we hit the ring?}
{501}{}{(The midget smirks.) Looks like you and the "Masticator" will be getting along just fine. Just don't bite off too many
 ears. Well... shall we hit the ring?}
{502}{}{(The midget smirks.) You don't look Russian. But whatever works for you... shall we hit the ring?}
{503}{}{(The midget smirks.) "Pity the fo," huh? Well, okay... but let's hope YOUR career goes somewhere. Shall we head to the ring?}
{504}{}{(The midget smirks.) Eye of the Tiger, huh? "Aaaydrian," "Aaaaydrian..." Heh-heh. I like it... lot of weight associated with it.
 Shall we head to the ring?}
{505}{}{(The midget nods.) }
{2505}{}{... not bad, not bad. It fits. (Nods at the ring.) Shall we get to it, then? You ready?}
{506}{}{Let's do it.}

# 32. WE HAVE NOT REACHED AN AGREEMENT (28)
{510}{}{No dice. Fifty-fifty or NOTHING. If you don't like that, walk.}
{511}{}{Fine. Though I wasn't aware vampires came in your size.}
{512}{}{Okay. 50/50. What's next?}
{513}{}{Did I say 25/75? I MEANT 50/50. We'll split the profit right down the middle. No problems here.}
{514}{}{[Walk.]}

# 33. STUART LITTLE (22, 33, 39)
{520}{}{Yeah, yeah, I know, "Stuart Little." My Mom used to read a lotta E.B. White. Now, you got a name?}
{521}{}{Hmmpph. You got a name?}
{526}{}{Nice meeting you, Stu. I don't have time to talk right now. Catch you later.}

# 34. DONE MUCH CIRCUS WORK IN YOUR LIFE? (33)
{530}{}{And what makes you think I've ever spectated a circus, much less been enslaved by one?}
{531}{}{Uh... well, I know that many of the citizens of New Reno act like they came out of a circus, and I thought...}

# 35. DONE MUCH CIRCUS WORK IN YOUR LIFE? (34)
{540}{}{YOU thought because I'm a person of short stature, the only career I could procure would be confined to the so-called 'big top.'}
{541}{}{Uh... well, now...}

# 36. DONE MUCH CIRCUS WORK IN YOUR LIFE? (35)
{550}{}{You took one QUICK look at me and thought you could deduce my entire life. It would never have occurred to you that a
 person of my height could have obtained a career in *Boxing Management.*}
{551}{}{I'm sorry, I meant no offense.}

# 37. I MEANT NO OFFENSE . . . (36)
{560}{}{Why should I take offense? Just because it seems to be the habit of everyone in this game to make instantaneous judgments
 of other NPCs based solely on their physical appearance?}
{561}{}{Well, I don't know about an INSTANTANEOUS judgment...}

# 38. . . . (37)
{570}{}{Why, I've done the same thing to you, for example.}
{571}{}{Oh?}

# 39. . . . (42)
{580}{}{(Looks at you pityingly.) But do you see the TRAGEDY here? I have mistakenly reduced you to a stereotype, a caricature,
 a generic Fallout model, instead of regarding you as a specific, unique character.}
{581}{}{Uh, but Stuart, I AM a typical hero model. In fact, I am the player character of this game.}

# 40. UH (13)
{590}{}{Not all women are attracted to barrel-chested, overly muscled male character models. You'd be surprised how many women
 find my size intriguingly ALLURING.}
{591}{}{And you'd be surprised how many men do as well.}

# 41. . . . (38)
{600}{}{I've taken in your ridiculously overly-muscled physique, your gritty Mad Maxx wanna-be demeanor, your unimaginative
 character point allocation and concluded you are a mini-maxing munchkin.}
{601}{}{I've taken in your over-pixilated breasts, your ridiculous sashay when you walk, your unimaginative character point
 allocation and concluded you are a mini-maxing Laura Kroft wannabe... a "munchkin."}
{602}{}{I...}

# 42. . . . (41)
{610}{}{You are nothing more than a typical 'RPG male hero model,' if you will, one of MANY such models that seems to fill this
 world in droves.}
{611}{}{You are nothing more than a typical 'RPG female hero model,' if you will, one of MANY such models that seems to fill this
