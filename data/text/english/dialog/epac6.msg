{100}{}{You see a worn-looking Hologram.}
{101}{}{You see the Director of Ground Maintenance.}
{102}{}{Hologram 10031. He is in charge of all the ground maintenance at the EPA.}

# Node  0  [Node001]
{200}{}{Hello there. Mind if I ask how you managed to get in here? The elevators to the surface broke down a long time ago.}
{201}{}{Let's see... I used a rope to climb down an elevator shaft to the utility level... Then I crawled through a fan duct and found myself in a robot maintenance area...}

# Node  1  [Node002]
{210}{}{I'm surprised you made it past all those damn plants without being eaten. I'm Hologram 10031, the Director of Ground Maintenance here at the EPA. [He sighs heavily.] I know, I know, the grounds look terrible. No need to tell me.}
{211}{}{If you're not happy with the way the grounds look, why don't you do something about it?}
{212}{}{No kidding. The grounds are littered with radioactive goo, corpses, mutant carnivorous plants... Seriously, you must be the worst groundskeeper ever.}

# Node  2  [Node003]
{220}{}{If I could do something about it, trust me, I would. I've got no physical body, and the damn robots won't respond to a word I say. I've been operating at 100% inefficiency for the last few decades -- how pathetic is that? The other Holograms won't let me forget it either. The only one more useless than me is the Director of Operations.}
{221}{}{Maybe I could help somehow?}
{222}{}{That's really a shame. I have to be going now. Goodbye.}

# Node  3  [Node004]
{230}{}{Hey, if you're really willing to help, that'd be great. I'll ensure you get something for your troubles.}
{231}{}{Consider it done. What can I help you with?}
{232}{}{No, I haven't the time right now.}

# Node  4  [Node005]
{240}{}{Those mutated spore plants have spread beyond the confines of the green house and have taken root all over the EPA's grounds. If you could get rid of all those bastards for me, that'd be a big step in the right direction.}
{241}{}{Sure, I could kill all the spore plants for you. I'll be back once it's done.}
{242}{}{That's easy enough. I already killed them all.}

# Node  5  [Node006]
{250}{}{Hello again. What can I do for you? *Sigh*}
{251}{}{You're looking rather glum. What's wrong?}

# Node  6  [Node007]
{260}{}{Hello again. Have you reconsidered helping me? As I mentioned before, I'll make it worthwhile for you.}
{261}{}{Yeah, why not. I have nothing better to do.}
{262}{}{No, I'm still too busy at the moment. I'll come back some other time.}

# Node  7  [Node008]
{270}{}{Have you completed the task for me?}
{271}{}{Yep, I've killed all the plants. The grounds still look like hell, but at least they're a little safer.}
{272}{}{No, not yet. I'll have to get back to you.}

# Node  8  [Node009]
{280}{}{Oh, thank you so much. For that, I hereby hire you as my assistant groundskeeper. [He points to a key on the floor by his feet.] I managed to coax one of the half working robots into bringing that for you. You now have authorization to access the storage shed. Thanks again.}
{281}{}{[You pick up the key and pocket it.] No problem. See ya.}

# Node  9  [Node010]
{290}{}{You look rather messy. Is everything all right?}
{291}{}{Yeah, I'm fine. I had some trouble with some mutated plants on the way down here but I took care of them.}

# Node  10  [Node011]
{300}{}{You have? Wonderful! For that, I hereby hire you as my assistant groundskeeper. [He points to a key on the floor by his feet.] I managed to coax one of the half working robots into bringing the keys to me awhile ago -- just in case. Take 'em. You now have authorization to access the storage shed. Thanks again.}
{301}{}{Oh no. It's all I could do. Don't worry about it.}
{302}{}{Hey thanks! Goodbye.}

# Node  11  [Node012]
{310}{}{Hey, you've done me a good turn so you'll take the key and anything you want or need. It's my way of saying thank you for what you've done.}
{311}{}{Oh, all right then. Say who are you anyway? Why is it so important to you that I've killed all of these plants?}

# Node  12  [Node013]
{320}{}{I'm the Director for Ground Maintenance. I ensure that the grounds are in good order, but as I'm a Hologram and can't do anything myself, I command the robots to do it all for me. As most of them have stopped working, I've operated at 100% inefficiency for the last few years. You've helped me more than you could ever imagine.}
{321}{}{Well, no problem. I've got to be going now.}


{330}{}{Keep up the good work, assistant.}
{331}{}{I'm now operating at 1% efficiency!}
{332}{}{You wipe out the mutant plants that have grown rampant over the EPA's grounds.}
{333}{}{The whole place has been taken over by these mutant plants.}
{334}{}{They're everywhere.}
{335}{}{And then there's the mantises...}
{336}{}{The greenhouse is in shambles.}
{337}{}{If only the robots would respond to commands.}
{338}{}{I know, I'm a complete failure.}
{339}{}{I thoroughly apologize for the state of the grounds.}
{340}{}{If I could do something about it, I would.}
{341}{}{Maybe 10001 is right. Maybe we should just destroy it all.}
