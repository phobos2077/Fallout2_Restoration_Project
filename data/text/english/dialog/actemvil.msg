{100}{}{You see Cameron, a fellow tribesman.}
{101}{}{You see Cameron.}
{102}{}{You see a young man with bulging muscles and a very confident air about him.}
{103}{}{Greetings, }
{104}{}{. I have the honor of being your final challenge. To continue in your quest you must defeat
 me in unarmed combat. Shall we begin?}
{105}{}{Me got questions.}
{106}{}{Okay, we fight.}
{107}{}{No, me get ready first.}
{108}{}{I've got some questions for you first.}
{109}{}{Sure, let's party.}
{110}{}{I think I need a moment to prepare for this.}
{111}{}{What would you like to know? }
{112}{}{Why we fight?}
{113}{}{We fight to death?}
{114}{}{We fight unarmed?}
{115}{}{Okay, we fight now.}
{116}{}{Me need get ready.}
{117}{}{Why do we have to fight?}
{118}{}{Is this a fight to the death?}
{119}{}{You say that we are to fight unarmed?}
{120}{}{Let's get this fight over with.}
{121}{}{I need a moment to prepare for the fight.}
{122}{}{The path of the Chosen One is not an easy trail to walk, }
{123}{}{. You will be faced with many challenges throughout your lifetime, and the most difficult
 of these will be dealing with your fellow man. There will come a time when diplomacy and tact
 will prove to be useless and your hand must be raised instead. This challenge prepares you to face
 another human, look him in the eyes, and know that you may have to kill him.}
{124}{}{Okay.}
{125}{}{I see.}
{126}{}{No, my friend, you need only defeat me. When the time comes, we will end the battle.}
{127}{}{Me understand.}
{128}{}{All right.}
{129}{}{Yes. Weapons tend to distance us from battle and desensitize the effects of our actions
 against others. When you strike another human being with your bare fist, you both see and feel the
 pain you cause. Battle becomes very personal and all too real then. This is an important lesson for
 you, }
{130}{}{.}
{131}{}{Me got it.}
{132}{}{I understand.}
{133}{}{Very well. Shall we begin?}
{134}{}{Me ready.}
{135}{}{No, me get ready first.}
{136}{}{I'm ready.}
{137}{}{No, I need some time to prepare.}
{138}{}{Very well. Return and tell me when you are ready for your challenge.}
{139}{}{Are you ready for your challenge, }
{140}{}{?}
{141}{}{Me ready. }
{142}{}{Me not ready yet.}
{143}{}{I think so.}
{144}{}{No, give me a minute.}
{145}{}{Excellent! Your equipment will be kept in the trunk outside of the room.
 You can get it after the fight. Let the fight begin! Good luck to you }
{146}{}{.}
{147}{}{It is good to see you again, Chosen One. How may I help you?}
{148}{}{Me want visit temple again.}
{149}{}{Want fight again?}
{150}{}{Just say hello. Me go now.}
{151}{}{I'd like to visit the temple again.}
{152}{}{Hello, Cameron. Ready for another fight?}
{153}{}{Just thought I'd say hi. See you later.}
{154}{}{Take the path to my left, Chosen One. It leads to the temple proper.
 The cave entrance behind me will return you to the last chamber.}
{155}{}{Okay, me go.}
{156}{}{All right. Thanks}
{157}{}{No thank you, Chosen One. I still carry the bruises from our last encounter and will need
 years to recover!}
{158}{}{Go bye, Cameron.}
{159}{}{Ha! Good day to you, Cameron.}
{160}{}{Chosen One, my ass. I am going to make you the dead one!}
{161}{}{You have defeated me. You are worthy, Chosen One.}
{165}{}{I disagree with you. I think that a peaceful solution to any problem is possible.}
{166}{}{You may be correct, }
{167}{}{, but not in our current situation. You must defeat me to succeed in your trial.}
{168}{}{Look, I don't know all of your strengths and weaknesses, and you don't know mine.
 Accidents do happen, so what if one of us inadvertently kills the other? Let's just
 end this now rather than take that chance, okay?}
{169}{}{Hmm... I see your point. I wouldn't want to be responsible for
 killing you when all I meant to do was test your mettle. Very well -- you may
 pass, Chosen One.}
{170}{}{Hmm... I see your point. However, we must still do battle. I will
 simply take care not to hurt you too much.}
{171}{}{Thanks! I'll see you back in the village.}
{172}{}{I see.}

{200}{}{I don't seem to remember our last battle, Chosen One. I will always wonder how you managed
 to get past me.}
{201}{}{You have a tongue of purest silver, Chosen One. Your skill with words will open many doors
 for you.}

{300}{}{And to you as well, Chosen One. May the spirits guide you on your quest.}
{301}{}{Thanks, Cameron.}

{302}{}{Chosen One, I could not help but notice that you lack strong combat skills. It has been my experience that you cannot always rely on your wits or words for protection. With your permission I will teach you a few things that I think you will find most useful.}
{303}{}{Yes, you teach.}
{304}{}{No, me not need.}
{305}{}{Yes, please teach me all that you can.}
{306}{}{Thanks, but I think I can handle myself just fine.}
{307}{}{You learn well, Chosen One. I think you will be able to handle yourself in a fight now. However, remember that even the strongest of warriors must sometimes retreat. There is no shame in living to fight another day.}
{308}{}{Me thank you, Cameron.}
{309}{}{Thanks, Cameron. I will remember your words.}
{310}{}{Very well. Return to me if you change your mind.}
{311}{}{Me thank you, Cameron.}
{312}{}{Thanks, Cameron. I will remember your offer.}

{400}{}{Do you ever think about stepping down from your position as the Temple's final trial? I mean, it can be pretty risky.}
{401}{}{Life is a constant series of risks, Chosen One. With each new dawn, every one of us takes a risk simply by stepping from our homes to greet the unknown day. Why do you ask?}
{402}{}{No reason. I'll talk with you later, Cameron.}
{403}{}{Well, I was just thinking about what happened to your predecessor, you know, during his battle with... uh, "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named".}

{410}{}{Ah, that was a dark day, indeed, for our tribe lost two good men: one in body, the other in spirit. But the foul deed of that day is no concern of mine. My time will come when the Gods deem it so.}
{411}{}{And may that day be a long time coming. Good day, Cameron.}
{412}{}{Are they even going to have other people attempt the Temple? Hasn't it already been determined that I'm the Chosen One?}

{420}{}{There will always be a need to test the might of our people. And I take great honor in doing my part.}
{421}{}{Alright, I'll see you later, Cameron.}
