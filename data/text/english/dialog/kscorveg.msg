{100}{}{An old, broken down Highwayman.}
{110}{}{This machine is in much worse shape than it looks -- nothing will make this run again. Looks
 like there's a box of engine parts on the back seat that's still in pretty good shape, though.}
{111}{}{This machine is in bad shape. There's a package on the back seat, though.}
{112}{}{This machine looks about the same as the others out front. Looks like there's a package on the
 back seat.}
{113}{}{This old machine is in great shape! I bet I could fix it up somehow. If only I had the parts...}
{120}{}{The engine looks too badly rusted to fix. While you were looking the car over, you found a
 bottle of fuel additive that looks as though it would burn really well.}
{121}{}{The engine is nothing but a pile of rust that falls apart as soon as you open the hood.}
{122}{}{This is a real fixer-upper. I guess I don't have the skill or parts to get this running yet.}
{123}{}{Looks as though this baby's almost ready to rock. Just a few more turns on this nut... (You jump
 back in surprise as the engine falls out of the car, collapsing into a pile of rust and component
 parts.)}
{130}{}{You find a fuel-injection system in the back seat.}
