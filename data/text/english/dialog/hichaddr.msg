{100}{}{You see a wooden door.}
{101}{}{This door is made of a solid wood. It seems to be built with a new locking system.}

{102}{}{This door is firmly locked.}
{103}{}{Using the technique you learned from Max, you carefully undo the trigger mechanism and
 effortlessly lockpick the door.}
{104}{}{Something seems different about this lock. You decide to leave it alone.}

{105}{}{You are about to get to work lockpicking when you notice a small little trigger mechanism in the locking system.
 If triggered, you never would have been able to lockpick the door. You skillfully remove it and then in a matter of
 seconds you have the rest of the door lockpicked.}
