{220}{}{Crop rotation avoids a decrease in soil fertility, as growing the same crop repeatedly in the same place
 eventually depletes the soil of various nutrients. A crop that leaches the soil of one kind of nutrient is followed
 during the next growing season by a dissimilar crop that returns that nutrient to the soil or draws a different ratio
 of nutrients.}
{221}{}{[MÁS]}
{222}{}{Crop rotation is also used to control pests and diseases that can become established in the soil over time.
 Plants within the same family tend to have similar pests and pathogens. By regularly changing the planting location,
 the pest cycles can be broken or limited.}

{230}{}{Botany is the scientific study of plant life. As with other life forms in biology, plant life can be studied
 from different perspectives, from the molecular all the way up to individual plants themselves. A good understanding of
 plants is crucial to our future as it allows us to:

 -Produce food to feed an expanding population.
 -Understand fundamental life processes.
 -Produce medicine and materials to treat diseases and other ailments.
 -Understand environmental changes more clearly.

  The rest of the information appears to be various charts, graphs, and pictures of cross sections of plants.}

{251}{}{A spore plant is a mutated form of some Venus-fly-trap-like plant. Additional testing has shown the plant is quite
 aggressive and has two forms of attacking. One is a spore which it spits at its enemies. The other form is a bite with its thorned maw.
 Great caution is suggested when handling and working with these life forms.}
{252}{}{After extensive testing, Centaurs appear to be the by-product of the Forced Evolutionary Virus. They seem to be
 a mixture of dog, cat, brahmin, and other animals. FEV isn't the only cause of the mutation, however, as radiation also
 appears to have played a role. They seem to prefer living in a heavy radiated environment and as such they radiate everything around them.}
{253}{}{[MÁS]}
{254}{}{The origin and etymology of Floaters are unknown but they are thought to be related to the Centaurs with which they are often found.
 They too appear to be the result of FEV. Additional testing has shown them to be completely immune to electrical damage.}
{255}{}{Radscorpions are an extremely large version of the North American Emperor scorpion, mutated by radiation.
 Contrary to initial expectations, their poison grew more potent, not diluted. They are nocturnal and sensitive to light.
 Further testing has shown that samples of poison from their tails can be used to make antidotes.}
