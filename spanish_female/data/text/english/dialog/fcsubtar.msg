{100}{}{You see an old console.}
{101}{}{Looks like this is the old torpedo target control console. Most of the monitors are busted or missing, with
 only a single one just barely operational. Random bits of data appear on the flickering screen from time to time.}
{200}{}{The operating system seems to be corrupted, as it doesn't respond to your commands like it should. You could
 figure the system out with a more scientific approach.}
{210}{}{With a few advanced commands, the system is subverted and starts behaving properly. A few keystrokes later, the
 torpedo guidance systems are disabled and rigged to explode a few moments after leaving the tubes. Science!}
{211}{}{You fiddle with the system for a few minutes, but it's just too far gone for you to salvage. Looks like
 you need to find another way to disable the torpedoes.}
