{100}{}{Ves a un hombre de aspecto harapiento.}
{101}{}{Ves al doctor Schreber.}
{200}{}{[You see a Shi scientist with a wispy beard and a crazed look in his eyes. His hair and clothes are disheveled and he appears to have not slept in days.] Ah! Yes! Yes, I was expecting you. They told me you were coming. [He looks you up and down.] Yes, you are perfect.}
{201}{}{¿Qué demonios está pasando aquí?}
{202}{}{You must be Dr. Sheng. Dr. Wong told me your location. The Shi thought you might be dead.}
{203}{}{Antes de nada, ¿qué es este lugar?}
{204}{}{Perfect for what, exactly?}
{205}{}{"¡Te dije que estaba enfermo!"}
{210}{}{Science! What else? I am Dr. Sheng and these creatures are my creations. Beautiful, are they not?}
{211}{}{Eh, bueno, sí, ¿y luego qué?}
{212}{}{Actually, I find them rather repulsive. Vomit inducing, really. And that smell, both sweet and fetid, like syrup made from corpse juice. What are these things?}
{220}{}{Ha! Dr. Wong wishes I were dead. Oh no, I am doing better than ever. And things will only improve if you are willing to assist me.}
{221}{}{¿Qué pasa con ellas?}
{222}{}{Hold on. Before I agree to help you with anything, tell me what these creatures are.}
{230}{}{They are the future! A new race of sentient plant life forms, created by me. I have finally achieved success in synthesizing my new plant life with fresh human cadavers! As you can see, this endows the plants with, sensory, ambulatory, and vocal capabilities which they would otherwise lack. It also grants a human-like appearance which will allow them to more easily assimilate into our culture.}
{231}{}{So where are you getting these 'fresh human cadavers'? }
{232}{}{Assimilate into our culture? Good luck with that. The ghouls and mutants can hardly manage that and they are—or were—at one point human. These things are abominations.}
{233}{}{Actually, I've met a spore plant that could talk without being infused with a human body.}
{234}{}{That's incredible. As a fellow student of science, I must know how this was made possible.}
{240}{}{Perfect for the task at hand. You see, not all of my experimental creatures have been as successful as the specimens you see here. Most tend to end up being mindless, violent brutes. I keep these failures locked within a pen in my lab, but they recently got loose. I managed to get out and lock the door before any could escape into the wild, but now I am unable to return to my lab.}
{241}{}{¿Qué quieres que haga?}
{250}{}{My creations, of course. They are ever vigilant of the wastes. There is much out there to be wary of, as I'm sure you would agree. When they told me of your approach, I instructed them to bring you to me, as I believe you may be able to assist me.}
{251}{}{¿Qué pasa con ellas?}
{252}{}{Before I agree to assist you with anything, tell me what these creatures are.}
{260}{}{Oh, mostly from raiders who foolishly decide to attack us here. But enough about that. I must know if you are willing to assist me.}
{261}{}{¿Qué pasa con ellas?}
{270}{}{You see, not all of my experimental creatures have been as successful as the specimens you see here. Most tend to end up being mindless, violent brutes. I keep these failures locked within a pen in my lab, but they recently got loose. I managed to get out and lock the door before any could escape into the wild, but now I am unable to return to my lab.}
{271}{}{¿Qué quieres que haga?}
{280}{}{How you feel about my work is of no concern to me. Now I shall be blunt. I have a task which you seem qualified for. Upon its completion, you will be rewarded. Are you interested?}
{281}{}{Estoy escuchando.}
{282}{}{Me encanta eso que haces con la lengua.}
{290}{}{Excellent! Give them to me, and you shall be rewarded.}
{291}{}{Sure, it's not like I have much use for them. Here you go.}
{292}{}{Nah. I've grown rather fond of the little guys. I think I'll hold on to them. Maybe start a garden or something.}
{293}{}{Quizá debería ir a ver si puedo encontrarlo.}
{294}{}{I don't have them on me, and even if I did I wouldn't hand them over to you. I want nothing to do with you or your veggie-zombies.}
{300}{}{The facility is known as the EPA. I've marked it on your mapping device. Please, go there and try to find some seeds. And not just any plain old seeds — they must be unique.}
{301}{}{Ah, it seems you already know the location of the EPA. Please, go there and try to find some seeds. And not just any plain old seeds — they must be unique.}
{302}{}{Volveré.}
{303}{}{Eh, on second thought, I'm not interested in working for you anymore. We're done here.}
{310}{}{[His eyes flare with rage] Kill him, my children! His body shall make a fine host for your newest sibling!}
{311}{}{[His eyes flare with rage] Kill her, my children! Her body shall make a fine host for your newest sibling!}
{312}{}{[HECHO]}
{320}{}{Excellent! Now I shall prepare your reward. Make yourself comfortable. This may take a little while.}
{321}{}{[CONTINUAR]}
{322}{}{Lo siento, forastero. No tengo tiempo de charlar contigo.}
{330}{}{Yes, bring the seeds to me and you may claim your reward.}
{331}{}{Volveré.}
{340}{}{Simply giving you the location of the facility is a reward in itself, as it is bound to be full of useful supplies. You may of course keep anything else you find. I am only interested in unique seed samples. Once you have brought them to me, I will give you a gift to present to the Shi.}
{341}{}{De acuerdo. Volveré.}
{342}{}{You call that a reward? I can explore ruins on my own time. I'm not interested.}
{350}{}{[Looks at you expectantly.]}
{351}{}{Oye, tengo esas herramientas que buscabas.}
{352}{}{Volveré cuando tenga más dinero.}
{360}{}{Then it seems I have no further use for you. [He motions to the plant creatures.] Kill him, my children! His body shall make a fine host for your newest sibling!}
{361}{}{Then it seems I have no further use for you. [He motions to the plant creatures.] Kill her, my children! Her body shall make a fine host for your newest sibling!}
{362}{}{[HECHO]}
{370}{}{[The Doctor departs. After about an hour, he returns and hands you a single plant seed.] This plant sample is my gift to the Shi. It will change everything. I am giving you the honor of presenting it to Doctor Wong.}
{371}{}{¿Qué es eso de rad?}
{372}{}{That's it? I went and got those damn seeds for you and this is what I get for my trouble? Yet another seed? Fuck you and your creepy plant zombies. I think I'll do the world a favor and put an end to this morbid operation of yours.}
{380}{}{The Shi have been attempting to create plant life that is resistant to radiation. I was the head of that project, but during my research I made a discovery that led me down a different path. I created a plant sentience serum, but after a few ... unfortunate incidences, the Shi wanted to shut the project down. So I left to continue my work unimpeded.}
{381}{}{Okay. So how does this plant sample figure into this?}
{382}{}{Sigue.}
{390}{}{Ironically, just as my focus was shifting to my new sentient plant creations, I happened to make a major breakthrough in radiation-resistant plant research. I kept this breakthrough a secret, as I did not want to draw attention away from my more significant discovery. When the others failed to see the importance of my sentient plants, I decided to keep my secret out of spite. That is, until now. With the plant sample I have given you, even a narrow-minded fool like Dr. Wong could achieve the goal of radiation-resistant plant life.}
{391}{}{¿A qué viene esa cara tan larga?}
{392}{}{Vale, veré lo que puedo hacer.}
{393}{}{I'll bring this to Dr. Wrong. But if he doesn't give me a proper reward for it, then you'll be seeing me again.}
{394}{}{You can keep the sample. I'm sure Dr. Wong and the other Shi scientists can figure it out without your help. I'm done doing you favors.}
{400}{}{I have had no change of heart. In addition to being radiation resistant, the plant sample is infused with my sentience serum. Like a proud father, I merely wish to see my creation flourish. Deliver it for me, and you shall be granted a true reward.}
{401}{}{Vale, veré lo que puedo hacer.}
{402}{}{Guárdate tu dinero. Me largo de aquí.}
{403}{}{Dr. Wong seems like a sly guy. You really think he'll trust a plant sample from you?}
{410}{}{It has come to my attention that there is an old US government facility where one might obtain unique plant seeds untouched by radiation. This facility is too far away for me to personally venture to, but I believe it would be a simple task for an experienced wastelander such as you.}
{411}{}{Oh, you're talking about these weird seeds from the EPA. Been there, got them.}
{412}{}{I'm always up for exploring some old ruins. Give me the location and I'll go see what I can find.}
{413}{}{¿Y qué saco yo de todo esto?}
{420}{}{Yes, Dr. Wong is a bit of an obstacle. If he were removed from the picture, things would go much more smoothly. Give Dr. Wong the sample. Even if he distrusts me, his curiosity will get the better of him and he'll accept it. Once the sample has been stored away, find a way to eliminate Dr. Wong without alerting the other Shi. Perhaps an overdose of some sort. Do this, and I'll see that your reward is tripled.}
{421}{}{Veré lo que puedo hacer.}
{422}{}{Si quieres suministros, necesitarás un formulario de solicitud.}
{423}{}{You know, this is all getting a bit complicated. I think I'd rather just massacre you and then go massacre the Shi.}
{424}{}{No tengo intención de ayudar a un viejo loco como tú. Me largo de aquí.}
{430}{}{Very well. This poison may come in handy. I extracted it from one of my creations. It is extremely deadly. [He gives you a syringe.]}
{431}{}{Veré lo que puedo hacer.}
{440}{}{[Looks at you expectantly.]}
{441}{}{Sigo trabajando en ello. Nos vemos.}
{442}{}{Le he entregado el antídoto a Redding.}
{443}{}{Los Shi tienen los planos del vertibird.}
{444}{}{Your method of revenge wasn't direct enough for my tastes, so I just killed everyone for you.}
{445}{}{Doctor Wong}
{446}{}{I delivered the sample to the Shi and told Dr. Wong about your intentions. He destroyed the sample immediately.}
{450}{}{Impossible! A spore plant cannot be capable of speech regardless of its intelligence. Either you are making some sort of jest or you were under a drug-induced hallucination. By the looks of you, I'd guess it was the latter. But enough about that nonsense. I must know if you are willing to assist me.}
{451}{}{Yeah, I suppose it *does* sound rather silly. Anyway, what did you want me to assist you with?}
{452}{}{Don't change the subject—I was telling the truth! I swear on the Vault Dweller, his name was Seymour and he could talk. He wanted me to re-plant him in a better location. I'm not making this up and I wasn't hallucinating.}
{460}{}{Enough! I do not have time for this foolishness. Will you assist me, or not?}
{461}{}{¿Qué pasa con ellas?}
{462}{}{No! I'm not going to assist you, asshole! Seymour was real! SEYMOUR WAS REAL!}
{470}{}{[He grins, obviously eager to show off his genius.] I've always been fascinated by plants. They are so remarkably different from animals, and yet surprisingly similar. When you look at an animal, you know it can think, that it's aware of its surroundings, experiences pain and fear. That it has reason. Obviously the extent of this ability varies, but the point is that an animal possesses this.}
{471}{}{Sigue.}
{480}{}{When you look at a plant though, do you also think this? If you kick a plant, does it fight back? Does it respond to you in anyway? Does talking to a plant affect its growth? Some cultures before the Great War tested such theories. A people known as the Germans conducted experiments which lead them to believe that plants are capable of emotions and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, and affection.}
{481}{}{But plants lack a nervous system, and without one what you're suggesting just isn't possible.}
{482}{}{I think all forms of life perceive in some way or another.}
{483}{}{Those spore plants I've encountered sure fight back. So yeah, I'd say plants feel something.}
{490}{}{And you would not be alone in thinking that. I too was skeptical at first. But you see, in the twentieth century, the United States government conducted similar experiments with a focus on communication. Sure, all forms of life have some means of self-damage detection, otherwise known as pain, but do they communicate this pain in some way? And what was the conclusion of these experiments? The idea of biocommunication—that plants are sentient.}
{491}{}{¿Crees que las Garras mortales que viven aquí pueden ser una amenaza para los humanos?}
{500}{}{And you would not be alone in thinking that. In the twentieth century, the United States government conducted similar experiments with a focus on communication.

{501}{}{¿Crees que las Garras mortales que viven aquí pueden ser una amenaza para los humanos?}
{510}{}{I'm suggesting that they COULD be like humans. And as you can see, I was right. They just required a little help.}
{511}{}{Un poco retozón, eh?}
{520}{}{Gene-splicing! Through the magic of science, I was able to develop a botany sentience serum. But giving the plants human-like intelligence was only half of the equation. In order to fully utilize such intelligence, I knew they would require a human-like body and senses.}
{521}{}{Ah, which is where the 'fresh human cadavers' come in. You must tell me how you were able to get the plant life to interface with and take control of a human nervous system. And a dead one, at that. I wouldn't believe it were possible if I hadn't seen it firsthand.}
{530}{}{Very well, I cannot promise you will fully comprehend what I am about to say, but I will do my best to explain it to you. [With the zeal of a preacher raving about his god to a rapt listener, he spends two hours detailing the process of his experiments, obviously taking great pride in his accomplishments.]}
{531}{}{[MÁS]}
{540}{}{And so now you understand, I hope?}
{541}{}{Yes, I do. It seemed totally impossible, but the way you've explained it makes complete sense. And the thing about the sponges, absolute genius! Morbid, but genius. But there was one thing you didn't explain. Where exactly are you getting these 'fresh human cadavers'?}
{550}{}{Now hold on there a minute. Dr. Wong will be a bit of an obstacle here. If he were removed from the picture, things would go much more smoothly. Give Dr. Wong the sample. Even if he distrusts me, his curiosity will getter the better of him and he'll accept it. Once the sample has been stored away, find a way to eliminate Dr. Wong without alerting the other Shi.

{554}{}{No tengo intención de ayudar a un viejo loco como tú. Me largo de aquí.}
{560}{}{Excellent. And what of Dr. Wong?}
{561}{}{Aún puedo borrarte del mapa.}
{562}{}{I'm not going to kill Dr. Sheng for you. I gave them the plant sample, and now I'm done helping you.}
{570}{}{I need them put down, and you look more than capable of the task.}
{571}{}{Why don't you send these, uh, more successful ones in there to take care of them?}
{572}{}{Suena bien, lo haré.}
{573}{}{¿Qué hay para mí?}
{574}{}{No me interesa tu dinero.}
{580}{}{They will not attack their own. They understand why I must now dispose of their less-fortunate brethren, but they will not carry out the task themselves. That left me in a rather delicate situation. Which is why I was so pleased to learn of your approach. So, will you assist me?}
{581}{}{Está bien, lo haré. }
{582}{}{¿Qué hay para mí?}
{583}{}{No me interesa tu dinero.}
{590}{}{The laboratory is right up there to the north. The sentry will let you through. Be careful. These creatures are incredibly strong, so try not to let them get too close. Oh, and beware of the poisonous spore they shoot out. But do not worry. I have an antidote, should you get poisoned.}
{591}{}{Genial. Volveré.}
{592}{}{So they're incredibly strong and have poisonous projectiles? On second thought, I'm going to have to pass.}
{600}{}{I shall give you money, of course. Also, I have information that I believe would be of great interest to you. So, will you assist me?}
{601}{}{Está bien, lo haré. }
{602}{}{No me interesa tu dinero.}
{610}{}{[Looks at you expectantly.]}
{611}{}{Volveré más tarde, cuando te hayas calmado.}
{612}{}{¡Todos los mutantes están muertos!}
{613}{}{All the creatures in the lab are dead, but I've been poisoned. You said something about an antidote?}
{620}{}{Yes, I shall administer it at once. Here.}
{621}{}{He tenido días mejores.}
{630}{}{It is a pity to lose those specimens, but a necessary evil to reclaim my laboratory. You have done well. Here is your monetary reward. [He hands you $1000.] The second half of your reward is information — and a second task to go with it.}
{631}{}{It is a pity to lose those specimens, but a necessary evil to reclaim my laboratory. You have done well. Your reward is information — and a second task to go with it.}
{632}{}{Salgamos.}
{633}{}{Forget it. Keep your information. I'm done working for you.}
{640}{}{Exellent. And the Shi have the sample I gave you?}
{641}{}{Oh, uh ... No, actually. I forgot to give it to him first.}
{700}{}{Has despejado la mina Wanamingo.}
{710}{}{Le he entregado el antídoto de Jet a doctor John.}
{800}{}{Ahhh...}
