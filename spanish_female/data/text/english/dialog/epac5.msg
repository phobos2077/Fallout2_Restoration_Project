{101}{}{Ves la estación de trabajo de Química.}
{102}{}{Hologram 12001. He directs operations within the EPA.}
{200}{}{[This weasely looking hologram regards you with a nervous smile.] Hello, welcome to the EPA. You may have noticed that we're experiencing some mild issues, but we'll cross that bridge once we come to it.}
{201}{}{Eh, de acuerdo. ¿Quién eres?}
{210}{}{I'm the Director of Operations for the EPA.}
{211}{}{Oh, right. [You scratch your head] What does that actually mean?}
{220}{}{[He chuckles uneasily.] Why, I coordinate things. Get the ball rolling. Now it's in your court. I like to bring out the best in people. Here at the EPA, that's what it's all about. Honestly. Integrity. Thank you, we value your opinion.}
{221}{}{¿De qué demonios estás hablando?}
{230}{}{I assure you that we are working diligently to resolve all issues. We've had a bit of downsizing, but things are looking up. I feel confident that all quotas will be achieved in due time.}
{231}{}{What quotas? You're not making any sense. Do you actually do anything here? Can you help me, or not?}
{240}{}{That all depends on your outlook. My hands are tied on this matter, but I'd be delighted to assist you if you could.}
{241}{}{Olvídalo. Adiós.}
{242}{}{Lo siento. No lo volveré a hacer.}
{243}{}{Gracias por tu tiempo.}
{244}{}{No quiero morir.}
{245}{}{No, no voy.}
{246}{}{I would, but I'm currently authoratally challenged.}
{247}{}{Lo tendré en consideración.}
{248}{}{This meeting is for discussion, not for action.}
{249}{}{I'm confident the EPA is on track for success.}
{250}{}{That issue's relevancy is in question.}
{251}{}{Let's not be hasty, lest we act too quick.}
{252}{}{Eso no suena bien.}
{253}{}{Entendido.}
