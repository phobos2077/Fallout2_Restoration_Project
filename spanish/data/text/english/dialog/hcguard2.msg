{100}{}{Ves a un guardia Hubologista.}
{101}{}{Parece bastante hecho polvo.}
{200}{}{(Looks at your with bored eyes) Hey. What brings you all the way down here?}
{201}{}{I'm here to let you off duty early. I'm on the next guard shift.}
{202}{}{Ashton sent me to get you. He said he needed to check with you about the recent set of donations.}
{210}{}{Quédate donde estás de momento, errante. ¿Qué estás haciendo aquí?}
{211}{}{Soy un nuevo recluta. Me dijeron que me estarían esperando.}
{212}{}{Entonces supongo que tendré que matarte.}
{220}{}{No tengo tiempo para esta mierda.}
{221}{}{Look, he seemed pretty pissed. I wouln't keep him waiting.}
{230}{}{Ah, hell. Fine. Watch over things while I'm gone. I'll be back in a few minutes.}
{231}{}{No hay problema.}
{240}{}{New recruit, huh? We get those here from time to time. Pretty boring job doing security here if you ask me. It's better than recruitment
 though, so I aint complaining. Good to have you aboard.}
{241}{}{Si fuera tú no volvería a hacer eso.}
{242}{}{I appreciate the welcome. So, interested in getting off shift early?}
{250}{}{Sure, why the hell not? Nothing exciting happens down here anyway. See you around.}
{251}{}{Cuídate.}
{260}{}{New recruit? Bullshit. Reinforcements are way too rare out here. Sounds like we got a rat on our hands. So long!}
{300}{}{What the fuck! Aston never asked to see me. I don't know what the hell's going on but there's no record of you being allowed here. Looks to me like we got an intruder on our hands -- Soon to be a dead intruder}
{400}{}{Woah, what the hell do you think you're doing!? Trying to rob us, right before my eyes... holy shit, you're a dumbass. Finally, I get to kill someone.}
{401}{}{Woah, what the hell do you think you're doing!? This is private property, so don't be touching any of this stuff. This is your only warning.}
{402}{}{I warned you. Trying to rob us, right before my eyes... holy shit, you're a dumbass. Finally, I get to kill someone.}
