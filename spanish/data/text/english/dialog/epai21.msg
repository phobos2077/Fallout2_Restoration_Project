{100}{}{Hello, welcome to the Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA! For your convenience,
 this terminal will provide you with descriptions of the various color coded areas that comprise our wonderful research
 facility. Please select a level for which you would like more information.}
{101}{}{SUB-LEVEL ORANGE}
{102}{}{SUB-LEVEL RED}
{103}{}{SUB-LEVEL YELLOW}
{104}{}{SUB-LEVEL INDIGO}
{105}{}{SUB-LEVEL VIOLET}
{106}{}{SUB-LEVEL GREEN}
{107}{}{SUB-LEVEL BLUE}
{108}{}{Sub-level Orange contains the conference rooms where all the exciting decisions are made, a cafeteria where delicious food is served, and some hazardous chemicals.}
{109}{}{Sub-level Red is home to our security department (so behave yourself!) and a small but informative museum. Also, don't forget to purchase some snacks and stop by the public execution chamber! [Disclaimer: Execution chamber may be unfit for children under the age of four.]}
{110}{}{Sub-level Yellow houses the power supply rooms for our amazing new holograms, and it's also where you'll find everyone's favorite drug making appliance, Mr. Chemmie! [Notice: Due to limited storage space, we've moved some hazardous chemicals into this area, so watch your step!]}
{111}{}{Sub-level Indigo is where our brilliant scientists are conducting some Top Secret Research! Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Remember, any unauthorized visitors found on this level will be shot on sight. So parents, don't let your children wander around unsupervised.}
{112}{}{Sub-level Violet contains the memory core for storage of data in the EPA and other things that aren't of much interest to visitors. Sorry! However, it directly connects to Sub-level Yellow, which contains more interesting things, like the pharmacist of the future, Mr. Chemmie!}
{113}{}{Sub-level Green is an exciting level that contains an arboretum, biological weapon research, fascinating new creatures and, every child's favorite, our unique petting zoo.}
{114}{}{Sub-Level Blue does not exist. If someone told you otherwise, they're dirty liars and are most likely communist sympathizers. Please report them to our security department on Sub-Level Red so they may be dealt with accordingly. Thank you for doing your part as a proud American!}
