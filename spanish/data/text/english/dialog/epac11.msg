{100}{}{Ves al sargento Granite.}
{101}{}{Ves a un yonqui demacrado. Tiene bolsas bajo los ojos y una expresión de dolor en su cara.}
{200}{}{[As you approach the cryogenic chamber, you see a slender, naked black man sprawled on the floor.
 His muscular body is still shaking from the icy, cold water. He looks up at you as you approach.]}
{201}{}{¿Quién eres?}
{210}{}{[Standing up and shaking himself dry like a wet animal, the man looks at you and smirks, revealing some oddly sharp front teeth.]
 Who am *I*? Who are *you*? You look like a heavily armed hobo!}
{211}{}{[Standing up and shaking himself dry like a wet animal, the man looks at you grinning widely, revealing some oddly sharp front teeth.]
 Who am *I*. Why, I'm only Sgt. Jules, the best-looking soldier on this base, gorgeous!}
{212}{}{Soy }
{213}{}{De acuerdo, ¿cuál es tu nombre?}
{214}{}{Don't you get cocky with me. What's with this place anyway?}
{215}{}{ aquí! (Dime qué está pasando aquí.)}
{216}{}{How come you're alive? The Doctor said he was the only survivor.}
{220}{}{The name's Sgt. Jules, but you can call me Cat. I'm the fastest and best-looking soldier on this base.}
{221}{}{Antes de nada, ¿qué es este lugar?}
{230}{}{You mean Doctor C? Why would he forget about me? Hell, he helped shape this work of *ART* [He gestures at his body].}
{231}{}{Antes de nada, ¿qué es este lugar?}
{232}{}{I think we are talking about two different people...So, what's going on around here anyway?}
{240}{}{This is some government facility as far as I know. They do all kinds of top secret research. But...[He looks around
 the room.] it's awfully quiet. Where is everybody?}
{241}{}{Well, this is probably going to come as a shock to you, but you've been frozen for over a century. The world's
 not the same anymore. They dropped the bombs and the Earth went silent. Society is still trying to rebuild itself from
 the ashes.}
{250}{}{[Sgt. Jules looks at you with a raised eyebrow.] You ain't kidding, are you? Well, they actually followed through
 with it then. Damn. Guess I'm lucky to have been pulled from the military and brought here.}
{251}{}{Ganas la mano.}
{260}{}{Yep. I was the energy weapons expert. Pretty nimble on my feet too. I was only in the army for about a year
 before I was reassigned here. It's a shame I'll never see any of my friends again. I would have liked to have exchanged some goodbyes.}
{261}{}{Lo siento.}
{262}{}{I'm sorry for your losses, but you have to move on. Wallowing in your own misery won't get you anywhere.}
{270}{}{Yeah, ain't we all. What am I gonna to do now though?}
{271}{}{No hay trabajo. ¿Qué voy a hacer?}
{272}{}{Ya veo. Bien, podría tomarme una copa. ¿Qué tienes para trasegar?}
{273}{}{Well, I really must be going. Best of luck to you out there.}
{280}{}{Hey, why not! I'll show you this Cat still got what it takes.}
{281}{}{Suena bien. Hagamos un trato.}
{282}{}{Lo que tu digas.}
{290}{}{Don't you worry about this ol' cat. I'll find my place in this world. Now step aside and let the Cat do his thing.}
{291}{}{[FIN]}
{300}{}{So, how did you end up in that cryo chamber? And what happened to your teeth?}
{301}{}{I used to be the guard for one of the genetics labs. They were messing with human and feline DNA.
 Trying to make something with the best of both worlds, I suppose. And that's where yours truly comes in.
 [Cat flashes you his toothy grin.] They wanted a volunteer for one of their projects. It was for scouts and the like, supposed to
 make you more agile and flexible. I liked the sound of that *leers*. Anyway, they gave me this shot, put me under, and
 the next thing I knew, I had these teeth, and I felt.... sharper? Kind of predatory.}
{302}{}{Sigue.}
{303}{}{Well, apparently the experiment wasn't going as planned and whatever they put inside me wasn't sitting
 well with my system. I don't know what they meant by that, since I felt better than ever. They decided to throw me in
 the cryo freezer until they figured out what to do with me.}
{304}{}{And then I thawed you out. Seems like you owe me one.}
{305}{}{Yeah, you saved me. In return, maybe I can save your sense of style, monkey.}
{306}{}{Gracias, es todo lo que necesitaba saber.}
{310}{}{Crees que puedes ser capaz de repararlo.}
{311}{}{I might be able to teach you a thing or two about energy weapons and other big weapons. Now you have to remember...}
{312}{}{[Continuar]}
{313}{}{There you go. That should help you melt those mutants who get in your way.}
{314}{}{Gracias.}
{390}{}{Quiero tomarme un tiempo contigo.}
{391}{}{Vamos.}
{392}{}{No, aún no.}
{400}{}{¿Necesitas algo?}
{401}{}{¿En qué puedo servirte?}
{402}{}{¿Sí?}
{410}{}{¿Qué quieres saber?}
{411}{}{Well, I was trained to use the usual military stuff. Rifles, pistols, SMGs and the like. I prefer laser
 weapons and the like better though. Those have style! But if you give me some brass knuckles or one of those power fists,
 I'll pounce on any flat-footed goons before they know what hit them!}
{421}{}{¿Qué te pasa en los ojos?}
{422}{}{De acuerdo. Volveré.}
{423}{}{Por mí está bien.}
{424}{}{I work better solo anyway.}
{430}{}{No tengo tiempo para esta mierda.}
{431}{}{Bien; no pienso esperar más.}
{440}{}{¿Nos vamos, Jefe?}
{441}{}{Es hora de que se lo hagamos pagar.}
{450}{}{It's good to be on the move again. My legs need to keep moving.}
{451}{}{Es hora de que se lo hagamos pagar.}
{460}{}{Sure, it looks like crap anyway. Got anything in blue?}
{470}{}{Ok, but this is *my* shiny thing. And if you try and take it off me, I may have to shoot you.}
{480}{}{Voy a disfrutar con esto.}
{481}{}{Vete, no tengo nada que decirte.}
{482}{}{Los he recibido peores practicando.}
{483}{}{Call a medic. I'm going down fast.}
{484}{}{Estoy sangrando... creo.}
{490}{}{Jesus, your ugly. You ought to get yourself checked out. I'm outta here.}
{491}{}{Guárdate tu dinero. Me largo de aquí.}
{500}{}{Don't get me wrong, it is good to stick together, but you are taking this a little too far. Come back when you
 got less people.}
{501}{}{Don't get me wrong, it is good to stick together, but you are taking this a little too far. Come back when you
 got less people. Now while you are making room, I'm going to find some clothing to wear. [Looking around, Cat Jules spots
 a locker, opens it and looks inside.] These really are not my style, but I guess they will do. [He quickly puts the clothing on.]
 Alright, let me know when you are ready.}
{510}{}{Did I eat bad fish or something? I feel poisoned.}
{520}{}{I feel like I am melting away here. Must be radiation poisoning.}
{530}{}{¿Cómo esperan que trabaje sin energía?}
{540}{}{Creo que hay algo mal en tu traje.}
{600}{}{Some might say I'm a pretty shallow guy, but a shallow guy with a great ass.}
{601}{}{In the army it was always, "Cat do this. Cat do that." What am I, a dog?}
{602}{}{[singing] 'Cause you make me tongue tied, tongue tied... [singing]}
{700}{}{LADIES! Ladies, one at a TIME, please!}
{710}{}{I've got a nose for trouble, and it's going off like a nuke attack siren!}
{720}{}{GOLD mining? This where they dig up the shiny things?}
{730}{}{Había tenido la esperanza de que nos mantendríamos alejados de este lugar para siempre.}
{800}{}{I've had enough of smart-ass lunatics! Can we leave this greasy little idiot?}
{810}{}{¿Qué pasa con esas cosas?}
{820}{}{Least I didn't end up like YOU, Lenny!}
{830}{}{Least I didn't end up like YOU, Marcus!}
{2900}{}{I need to put on some clothing first. [Looking around, Cat spots a locker, opens it and looks inside.]
 These really aren't my style, but I guess they'll do. [He quickly puts the clothing on.] Alright, I'm good to go.}
{2901}{}{[FIN]}
{5000}{}{[The man stands up and shakes himself dry like a wet animal. As he looks at you, his eyes suddenly get really wide and he starts gasping for air.}
{5001}{}{[FIN]}
{5002}{}{¡Joder!}
