{100}{}{You see a vigilant Shi guard.}
{101}{}{This scowling man appears to be guarding the motorboat. He seems to be taking his job very seriously.}
{200}{}{[He eyes you suspiciously.] Help you with something?}
{201}{}{Nope. I'm all set. Bye.}
{202}{}{I was just wondering what you're doing.}
{203}{}{Say, that's a nice boat you got there. Does that thing still work?}
{204}{}{Me ride metal fishy-fish?}
{210}{}{None of your business, outsider. Piss off.}
{211}{}{Poor choice of words, asshole. They're gonna be your last.}
{212}{}{I can take a hint. No need to be a dick about it. Bye.}
{213}{}{Whatever you say, buddy.}
{220}{}{[He looks at you as if you're dumbest creature he could possibly imagine. Slowly, he shakes his head.] You no ride metal fishy-fish. You go. You go, or I shoot. Understand?}
{221}{}{Okie, bu-bye!}
{222}{}{You meanie-man. Me smash meanie-man!}
{230}{}{[The guard grips his weapon and glares at you wordlessly.]}
{231}{}{Can I borrow your boat for a minute?}
{232}{}{I was just checking to see if you're still an asshole. Yep, looks like you are. Bye.}
{233}{}{Sorry, I thought you were, uh, someone else. Bye.}
{234}{}{I hope you know how to use that thing, 'cause I plan on taking that fucking boat, one way or another.}
{240}{}{[He looks at you as if you're dumbest creature he could possibly imagine. Slowly, he shakes his head.] No. Now go away. Ask me another question, and I'll hurt you.}
{241}{}{Alright, I'm going. Bye.}
{242}{}{Is that a fact?}
{250}{}{¡Lárgate de aquí!}
{251}{}{Touch that again and I'll kill you.}
{252}{}{I warned you!}
