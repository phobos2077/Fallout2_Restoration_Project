{100}{}{Ves una barra.}
{101}{}{Ves a Brian.}
{102}{}{Parece extremadamente cansado e irritable.}
{103}{}{You see Serin. He looks badly injured and has a broken leg.}
{104}{}{Ves a Set. Está hablando consigo mismo.}
{105}{}{Ves a Chip. Parece estar mejor.}
{106}{}{Ves a una mujer de aspecto estirado. No parece que haya estado relajada desde hace años.}
{200}{}{*ugh* Die fiend!! You won't be ta-}
{201}{}{Te sientes un poco más seguro ahora que el perro está muerto.}
{202}{}{What!? Oh, praise the spirits, fren. I feared I be done for.}
{203}{}{¿Qué pasó?}
{204}{}{Jerem and I be going out for weekly hunt. Took cave passage to field where many geckos roam. Hunt went bad. Had to run. Too many geckos with spirits of fury. We entered cave. Started yelling for help. [He pauses for a moment and winces in pain as he tries to rub his leg.]}
{205}{}{Por favor, continúa.}
{206}{}{Passage was already on brink of doom. Water seeping in from stream overhead. A deadly pass, but it be a great shortcut to fields. Not no more. See, we be yelling like fools and the ceiling come crashing down on us.}
{207}{}{[Continuar]}
{208}{}{Poor Jerem. I saw big rock crush him like bug. The big rocks missed me, but the Gecko's bite didn't. Just when I thinking I be safe, a gecko come from nowhere and take big bite outta leg. Took me right to the ground. Had no spear, thought the Gecko be dining on me for sure. But the spirits had other plans. Brought a final big 'o rock down on the geckos head. Crushed it flat. But crushed my leg, too.}
{209}{}{[Continuar]}
{210}{}{So I be stuck on ground, without spear. Suddenly, I be hearing something come at me from the dark. It got closer, and I saw it be one big angry gecko. The falling rocks only be making it more pissed. That's when you came in, fren. Truly, I be in your debt.}
{211}{}{Wow, that's quite the story. It seems you're very lucky to be alive. How's your leg?}
{212}{}{Not good, fren. It seems rock be stronger than my leg bone. I doubt I be getting up and walking out soon.}
{213}{}{Don't worry, I'm a skilled doctor. Let me have a look at your leg and I'll see what I can do.}
{214}{}{Don't worry, I shouldn't have a problem carrying you out of here. Then we can have the shaman take a look at your leg.}
{215}{}{We should probably get a professional to come here and look at it. I'll quickly go try to find some help. The cave seems to be empty now, so you should be safe here until I return.}
{216}{}{Hmm... I don't think I'm quite strong enough carry you out of here, but I bet Sulik could do it. [to Sulik] Let's carry this guy out of here.}
{217}{}{Hmm... I don't think I'm quite strong enough carry you out of here, but I bet Marcus could do it. [to Marcus] Let's carry this guy out of here.}
{218}{}{[You examine the warrior's leg. It's badly ripped up and the bone is showing in some parts. You skillfully snap the bone back in place, stop the bleeding, splint the leg, and set to work on healing it.]}
{219}{}{[After about 15 minutes of agonizing work, the leg is in much better shape. It looks as if this man will be able to walk again.]}
{220}{}{Alright, that should about do it. You'll need a couple days of rest for it to fully heal. Don't put too much pressure on it during this time and you should be fine.}
{221}{}{Holy spirits posses you, fren! I thank you. Now I be hobbling my way to the shaman. Get some good herb to ease the pain. Be seeing you back at the village, fren.}
{222}{}{[HECHO]}
{300}{}{¡Gracias! Te veré en el poblado.}
{400}{}{Thanks much, fren. Truly, you are blessed by the spirits.}
{500}{}{Zzzzzzz...}
{501}{}{...bzzzzzz...}
{600}{}{Has muerto.}
{700}{}{Bien, gracias por el consejo. Creo que será mejor que me vaya.}
{1000}{}{Me alegra verte, }
{1001}{}{Te arrepentirás de lo que has hecho aquí.}
