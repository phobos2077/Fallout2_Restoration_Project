## Translations
[![Translation status](https://tra.bgforge.net/widgets/fallout/-/rp/svg-badge.svg)](https://tra.bgforge.net/projects/fallout/rp/)

- Most translations are **incomplete**, they are provided as is. If you use an incomplete translation, you'll see bits of English in the game.
- You can [help with completion](https://tra.bgforge.net/projects/fallout/rp/). For additional info, see the [forums](https://forums.bgforge.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=22).
