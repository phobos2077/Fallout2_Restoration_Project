### It's not a bug, it's a feature!

This page lists various items that are deliberate developers' decisions and/or too hard to fix. They are not bugs, so don't bother to report them as such.

However, if you present a strong case why a decision is wrong, it might be reversed.
The chance is slim, but it improves if you're willing to implement it **yourself** and submit a pull request.

- EPA:
  - Holograms show on motion sensor.
    - Just too minor to bother.
  - Cannot reach the entry area of EPA to get back to the world map, because it want to let to scroll down to it.
    - You need to have the resolution patch installed. You can still play at 640x480, though.
  - No animation when using spray on plants
    - [Engine bug](https://github.com/phobos2077/sfall/issues/356).
- New Reno:
  - When you dance at the Shark Club the default female critter is used, even if you play as a red-head or blondie.
    - RP (as in RPG) explanation: you're wearing a wig.
    - Real explanation: we'd have to add new critters to the game to address this.
  - Some gangs around the city, led by casino-bouncers'-look-alikes, are not hostile towards player and are considered good NPC's, even though their floating texts highly suggest that they should engage the player just like other gangs - raiders, etc and be considered bad NPCs.
    - Arguably, they are patrolling to defend New Reno from raiders, etc, not to rob people.
    - Is this UP or RP? Need to check how it is in vanilla.
  - You can buy Monte's cards via barter and then he still whines about losing the cards.
    - Just too minor to bother. (And not sure how to fix).
