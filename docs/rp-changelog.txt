======================================
Release 2.3.3: - Released JULY/05/2014
======================================
New Content:

• Restored bell sounds before each round when boxing in New Reno. This was prevented before by a vanilla bug.
• Cult of Personality now also applies to town reputations and not just global reputations. This was accidently omitted when I restored the Cult of Personality perk to the game. 23 scripts were modified for this latest change, mostly in Klamath and Vault City. In total, only 58 out of over 1,000 scripts make use of this perk, which just goes to show that the reaction system was never truly fleshed out in this game. But hey, at least the perk isn't useless anymore.


Bug Fixes:

Abbey:
------
• Entering the Abbey after solving the grave digger questline will no longer cause Tom to move to his initial offscreen starting position only to proceed back to the Peterson's house.

Den:
----
• Fixed regression where using an item from your inventory (right-click with inventory open) while carrying Anna's diary would result in a message about the diary being displayed, even if you weren't looking at the diary.
• Fixed issue for the situation where Lara could disappear after the attack at Tyler's party.
• It is now possible to double cross Lara and then double crosses Tyler, thus ending with helping Lara. Before a situation like this would result in a broken gang war quest.
• Fixed a few more misc issues with the Den gang war.
• Removed knife near the West end entrance that was not stacking with other knives.
• Fixed instance where the squatters getting killed after establishing the orphanage and then talking to Mom could result in the quest getting completed twice.
• Fixed issue where squatters were being created and added to the map multiple times.

EPA:
----
• If you don't kill the plants on the surface before talking with the Director of Ground Maintenance and taking the quest, he'll keep asking whether you completed the task despite having done so and receiving the reward from him.
• The Brave Little toaster would still complain about not feeling well even after fixing him. This has been corrected.
• Zoo creatures no longer use tribal combat taunts.
• Improved fail message when attempting to repair the data storage and maintenance computer with an insufficient repair skill.

Military Base:
--------------
• Reverted change which prevented Melchior from spawning molerats.

Vault City:
-----------
• Fixed issue with Cassidy' base stats being reset when saving/reloading the game.

Misc:
-----
• High resolution patch updated to V4.1.8.
• Sfall updated to v3.3.
• Fixed instances in some NPcs (Sulik, Cassidy, Marcus, Dogmeat) where when you recruit them there is a "phantom" dialogue window that pops up and then immediately closes.
• Fixed issue with Dogmeat where giving him gecko-on-a-stick would always bring up his initial dialogue for joining, even if he was already in your party.
• Killing some traders was not affecting the Chosen One's karma.
• Nomad shaman no longer combine broc and xander for free.
• Changed the name of two unused animations in critters.lst to the proper syntax so that the Mapper correctly displays all available critters. Useful for modders.

======================================
Release 2.3.2: - Released JAN/01/2014
======================================
Bug Fixes:
----------

Klamath:
--------
• Some female children were still incorrectly using the male child model instead of the new female one.

New Reno:
---------
• Fixed nasty bug accidently introduced with the extended dance sequence in the last release. Sorry about that!
• Restored missing script that triggers when entering Lloyd's room.
• Reverted change about casinos becoming abandoned after wiping out a gang family. While logical, it became controversial and other areas of the game don't get affected in this way. So, it's all or nothing and we're going with back to the vanilla state (nothing).


======================================
Release 2.3.1: - Released DEC/31/2013
======================================
Bug Fixes:

Den:
----
• You can no longer gamble at Becky's gambling tables after she is dead.

Vault City:
-----------
• Unlocked dialogue for Cassidy where he talks about his dislike of Myron. This is all vanilla and I swear it was unlocked long ago, but seems to have been lost. Anyway, it's back!

New Reno:
---------
• Extended the dance sequence that you can do as a female player at the Shark Club.
• Wiping out a gang family causes the casino to become abandoned (i.e. you can't gamble anymore, the patrons leave, etc).

EPA:
----
• Killing the spore plants on the Green Level no longer counts towards wiping out the plants on the surface.

Vault 13:
---------
• Unlocked conversation with Goris asking him about his true identity. This was prevented before by bad vanilla scripting.

Random Encounters:
------------------
• Fixed crashes with Kaga. Most cropped up due to saving/loading during his encounter, but this should also make his encounter more stable in general as well. Also potentially fixes the issue where you would encounter Kaga but the map would be empty.

Misc:
-----
• Added high-res patch v3.06 as a legacy option in the installer for Mac OS users and those that need to use an older version of the high-res mod because of graphic/UI problems.
• Installer fix for Russian translation: Deselecting Cassidy's new voice will correctly NOT copy over the Russian voiced files. Before, the Russian voice files were always copied over when you chose the Russian language, no matter what Cassidy options you set.
• Several vanilla fixes that I won't list here (unofficial patch docs has that info), but I want to at least mention it so you don't think this release of the RP isn't worth the update. ;)


======================================
Release 2.3: - Released DEC/23/2013
======================================

-----
• Installer fixes/tweaks:
    -Properly handles Steam installation path if it's in the Program Files directory.
    -Installer checks fallout2.cfg to make sure the music path is correct and will correct it if it isn't. This is especially important for GoG users.
    -Armors for non-human characters would not get copied over unless the human armor option for companions was also chosen. This has been corrected.

• Sfall updated to v3.2.

======================================

• The player reload animation is now played everytime you reload your weapon. (sfall option)
• Repair bay at Sierra Army depot now repairs hurt bots or replaces destroyed ones. This will occur on any level of the Sierra Army Depot. A previous version of the RP mentioned this feature, but it was in fact not properly restored.

• Combine torn pieces of paper to form a password list to access the various computer terminals in the Shi Temple.


Modified Content:

• Primitive Tribe changes:
  -Based on community feedback, the Primitive Tribe was renamed to Umbra Tribe. The Primitive Tribe was a placeholder name by the original devs, so it was time a real name was chosen.
  -New entrance map picture.
  -Overhaul of the spirit questline.
  -Dialogue changes made to make the location more consistent with what is expected from tribals in the Fallout world.
• New entrance map picture for the Abbey.
• If you happened to make Lenny glow from a radioactive drink, you can now remove this effect by applying some RadAway.
• The large metal globe on the EPA entrance map no longer continuously rotates. This was changed because a) how could it keep moving after so many years and b) there are too many animated scenery objects on the map, which causes slowdowns for some people.

Bug Fixes:

• Fixed inconsistent dialogue with the Abbot if you killed the deathclaw before speaking to him.

Arroyo:
-------
• You were unable to steal from Hakunin's chest if you were out of his sight. This has been corrected.
• Lucas now gives you a text float when he has no more to teach you, rather than running through the same dialogue again only to learn that he has nothing more to offer. This is now consistent with the other warriors who teach you at your tribe.
• Fixed spawn locations of broc flower and xander roots on the hunting grounds that were often out of range of the player.
• Hakunin's talking head was broken at night.

• One of the wanamingos was incorrectly using a script assigned to the Redding wanamingos. This caused the wanamingo clearing quest at Redding to end prematurely.
• Fixed logic bug with the robot control computer.

------
• Wooz no longer stocks normal beer and booze; only radioactive stuff now.
• More fixes to the Brain.

• Fixed issue with having Bess in your party and taking Grisham's job of defending his brahmen.
• There are several spots in the northwest section of Farrell's garden—which is also the densest—where you can't attack critters even if you're standing right next to them. This has been addressed.

• Corrected issues with dumb player dialogue and Krom.
• Sulik will now correctly go hostile if you attack his tribe.

• Companions sometimes had incorrect talking head backgrounds when at night or when at various locations.
• All quotes (double or single) are now consistent and use straight quotes in all the text files.

Broken Hills:
-------------

Klamath:
--------
• If you take the quest to rustle the Brahmin but then tell the Duntons you're ashamed and decline the reward, the quest remains active and you cannot pursue any other dialogue options with them until you accept your reward, making it impossible to talk them into leaving Torr alone and complete the "Find out who is rustling brahmin" quest until you say, "I'm here for my cut, partners". This has been modified so that telling them you're ashamed also ends the quest.

Modoc:
-----
• There are no longer two Karls on the Main Street map.

---------------
• Gecko skins lying on the ground have been removed to ensure that the odd inventory bug (carry weight suddenly goes to a ridiculous number) no longer happens.

Raiders:
--------
• You would always end up at the "secret" entrance no matter how good your outdoorsman is. This is no longer the case.

Redding:
--------
• Local variables were being overwritten for Fannie, which caused her quest state to change sporadically. This no longer happens.

San Francisco:
--------------
• Entering the Hubologist stash for the first time with IN<4 would get you stuck in an endless conversation loop with the guard. This is no longer the case.
• Corrected dialogue bug with the sub motor boat guard.

Vault 13:
---------
• It was impossible to learn the true purpose of the vaults from "voice interface terminal". This is no longer the case.
• Hacking into overseer logs always succeeded, as there is no roll against skill there. It now correctly does a science check.

-------------------
• Corrected dialogue bug when asking Connar about Old Joe.
• Corrected dialogue bugs with Connar when taking the diplomatic route to save the village.

Misc:
-----
• Hopefully truly corrected all instances where little boy appearances were used rather than the new little girl appearances for female children.
• Additional Karma Images are changing not only on "Karma" tab, but they also replace image corresponding to the first position item on "PERKS" and "KILLS" tabs ("TRAITS" and usually "Alien kills" respectively). Fixed in sfall 2.11

======================================
Release 2.0: - Released MAR/31/2010
======================================
New Content/Vanilla Game Changes:

Major Changes:

• Complete dialogue overhaul for every RP location and character

The dialogue in the RP often left much to be desired and it never quite fit with the rest of the vanilla dialogue. Well, this should no longer be the case and nearly all the dialogue at RP locations has been rewritten and should seamlessly fit into the rest of the game. A big thanks to community member Dravean for his help in this area. 

• Kaga Redone

Kaga has been completely overhauled to be more true to his original intent. His encounters are no longer scripted sequences and nor are they forced. Kaga's encounters are just like normal encounters, but deadly ones at that. You'll get some dialogue to go along with it too, but it has completely been rewritten. 

• Complete overhaul of the EPA

This location has been completely redesigned to be bigger and better than ever - new map, new dialogue, new quests, new secrets, etc. A big thanks to Pixote for his awesome mapping and graphic skills. 

• 3 new recruitable npcs available

To go along with the EPA overhaul, there are now 3 npcs that can join you which are found there. The one you get depends upon the skills you have chosen to develop. 

• Improvements to every RP location

Not only has the dialogue improved at every RP location, but the quests have also been altered. The quests at these locations have been improved and new ones have even been added. 

• Shi Submarine

Sailing to the Enclave no longer requires just fixing up the Tanker. The undead guardian of San Francisco is preventing anything from entering or leaving the harbor and something has to be done about it. This content has finally been realized thanks to the beautiful graphic work of community member Continuum. 

• Improved maps

Both vanilla and RP locations look better than ever thanks to help of community member Pixote. 

• Vertibird is no longer flyable to the Enclave, but... 

You no longer can fly a vertibird to the Enclave, as there really wasn't enough evidence supporting the intent of this. It didn't even make sense logically - how could everyone from your tribe, etc fit on board? However, evidence instead points to the intent for the player to stowaway on a vertibird during the Salvatore-Enclave transaction. Thus, in much the same way as the player could get to the Military Base in F1 at an earlier time than usual, the same concept is now possible in F2. The chance of survival is slim, but it's not impossible. 


Other Changes:

• Updated Sfall to the latest version currently out (2.6a).
• Source of the "too many items bug" seems to have been found and fixed. Hoarders rejoice!
• All party members will now give text floats when crippled, radiated, poisoned, etc.

• New graphics for the cryogenic chambers as well as a new electric chair.

• Unlocked dialogue where The Corsican Brothers give special comments for selected Pornstar names.
• It is now possible to smell the cologne on Cody's dead body and deduce that Jules is the killer.
• You can now gain citizenship at Vault City from Lynette by blowing up Gecko's reactor. She said she would give you it, but never did. It's good to be evil.
• New and improved town map for the Abbey.
• Added "special surprise" found only after beating the game. Just travel the Wastes after beating the game and you will find this nice treat!
• Unlocked dialogue with the Enlightened One in NCR.
• Unlocked dialogue with the President discussing the Vice Presidents role in the Project.
• Added night version of the wasteland background used for NPC talking heads.
• New Child Killer karma title.

• Added option in the installer for new animations for the Sniper, Hunting Rifle, FN Fal and Wakizashi courtesy of Josan12.
• Added option in the installer for animations when smoking cigarettes and drugs found at EPA. Smoking too much gives you the "Smoker" karma title. Courtesy of Josan12.
