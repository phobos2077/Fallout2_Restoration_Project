{100}{}{You see a door.}
{101}{}{It looks very sturdy.}
{102}{}{The door doesn't seem to budge.}
{103}{}{(You notice a small hole in the door where sound seems to be coming from.) Hello?}
{104}{}{Uhh, hello?}
{105}{}{Since when could doors talk?}
{106}{}{Uhh, hi.}
{107}{}{GANG PROBLEM LIMB.}
{108}{}{Click... (The door unlocks.)}
{109}{}{Sorry, we don't need any of that.}
{110}{}{The door is bolted from the other side. There doesn't seem to be anything to pick.}
{111}{}{The door is flush to the frame and doesn't have anywhere to place a trap.}
{112}{}{The door creaks and breaks under the strain.}
{113}{}{The door is already unlocked.}
{114}{}{The door feels no challenge from you.}
