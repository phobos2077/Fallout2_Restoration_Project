# 4. FLOAT/CLICK (DAD IS DEAD) (WTG)
{230}{}{I still can't believe Dad is dead. There's so much that I wanted to say to him…}

# 5. FLOAT/CLICK [MALE, MADE MAN, FA = WRIGHT, NORM] (WTG)
{235}{}{Piss off.}
{236}{}{Piss off. I mean it.}
{237}{}{I ain't got nothing to say to you.}

# 6. INTRO (NORMAL) (WTG)
{245}{}{Yeah?}
{246}{}{Hey! How's it going, }
{1246}{}{? Everybody treating you all right? Anything you need?}
{247}{}{Hey, you got my thanks for finding who killed Richard, }
{248}{}{. I owe you big, and the Wright family always pays its debts. What can I do for you?}
{249}{}{Mattah. Man is Mattah!}
{250}{}{Hoobajuube}
{251}{}{Wander off}
{252}{}{Who are you?}
{253}{}{I'm looking for a job. Is Family Wright hiring?}
{254}{}{Say, I ran into your mom.}
{255}{}{Can you tell me about Richard?}
{256}{}{Nothing. Sorry to bother you.}
{257}{}{Can you tell me about the Wright Family?}

# 7.  RETARD (6)
{265}{}{Piss off, retard. I ain't got time to do sign language with you.}

# 8.  WHO ARE YOU? (6)
{275}{}{I'm Chris. Chris Wright. Of the Family Wright. Glad you asked?}
{277}{}{Family Wright? Who's that?}
{278}{}{Chris Wright, huh? Say, I ran into your mom.}
{279}{}{Can you tell me what happened to your brother Richard?}
{280}{}{Not really. Sorry to bother you.}

# 9. FAMILY WRIGHT? WHO'S THAT? (8, 10, 12)
{290}{}{You ain't heard of Family *Wright?* You musta been out in the desert too long. Family Wright is the biggest crime family
 in Reno. We're gonna rule this city.}
{291}{}{Really? Sounds like the Wright family holds all the cards. Are they hiring?}
{292}{}{Actually, I got the impression they were one of the weakest of the families…I mean, they only deal in alcohol, they have no casino or drug trade, and their numbers are much less than other families.}
{293}{}{Speaking of family, I ran into your mom.}
{295}{}{Really? How interesting... well, look, I have to be going.}
{296}{}{Family Wright is the biggest crime family in Reno. We're gonna rule this city.}

# 10. QUESTIONS (15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 26, 28)
{305}{}{Like what?}
{306}{}{Can you tell me about Family Wright?}
{307}{}{Is Family Wright hiring?}
{308}{}{I ran into your mom not long ago. Nice lady.}
{310}{}{No, no other questions. I better be going.}

# 11. INTRO (SLAVER) (WTG)
{315}{}{(The young man looks you up and down. His eyes stop at the mark on your forehead.) Well, now. (He sneers, then spits
 on your feet.) Why don't you make yourself useful and lick that up, slaver?}

 useful and lick that up, you piece of }
{317}{}{ dogshit?}
{318}{}{Kick him with the boot he spat on.}
{320}{}{Let it alone and walk away. This time. }

# 12. I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB . . . [GOOD RESPONSE] (6, 8, 9, 10)
{325}{}{Well, I… I mean, the Wright family… my family… might have an opening. I ain't promising nothing, but go to the mansion
 south of here, find my brother Keith and tell him I sent you. Name's Chris. Chris Wright.}
{326}{}{Uh, Family Wright? Who's that?}
{327}{}{Wright, huh? I ran into your mom.}
{329}{}{Thanks.}
{330}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some questions?}

# 13. I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB . . . [BAD RESPONSE] (6, 8, 9, 10)
{335}{}{Naw... we don't usually hire muscle that's not family. You can try asking Pa at the house, but he'll most likely
 just say no.}
{336}{}{All right then.}

# 14. I RAN INTO YOUR MOM (NORMAL) (6, 9, 10, 11, 12)
{345}{}{(Cringes.) *Greeeat.* Did she give you a speech?}
{346}{}{A little. Do you not like your mother?}
{347}{}{No. Does she usually?}
{348}{}{Not really. Look, I better be going. }

# 15. I RAN INTO YOUR MOM (INSULT) (9, 16)
{355}{}{That a JOKE? If so, it damn well missed the funny mark by a mile. You trying to start something with Family Wright?}
{356}{}{Start something? No, just FINISH it.}
{357}{}{No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Look, I had some other questions…}
{358}{}{No, not at all. I think I better be going. }

# 16. DO YOU NOT LIKE YOUR MOM? (14)
{365}{}{(Shrugs.) She just doesn't pay attention to what's going on around her. I love her n' all, but sometimes, she's as blind as a mule.}
{366}{}{Well, not long ago, she charged into our alcohol still here and busted up the place, destroying our entire cash crop!
 I love her n' all, but sometimes she's as blind as a mule.}
{367}{}{Heh-heh. And she looks like one, too.}
{368}{}{Blind? How do you mean?}
{369}{}{Oh. I had some other questions…}
{370}{}{I suppose. Look, I better be going. }

# 17. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? (16)
{380}{}{She goes around and preaches all about sinning and stuff, but she doesn't even really know what Dad does. Either that, or she ignores it.}
{381}{}{What does your Dad do?}
{382}{}{Hmmmm. Say, I had some other questions…}
{383}{}{Interesting. Well, I have to be going. }

# 18. WHAT DOES YOUR DAD DO? (17)
{390}{}{Makes alcohol, runs guns, rubs out people who fuck with him…typical family stuff. Mom'd be pissed if she actually paid
 mind to what was going on. And 'specially if she found this still, here.}
{391}{}{How pissed would she be?}

# 19. HOW PISSED? (18)
{400}{}{Probably pissed enough to wreck this place…at least. Then she'd give us all a tongue lashing and a few solid days of
 preaching. Heh. }
{401}{}{Interesting. Say, I had some other questions…}
{402}{}{Hmmmmm. Thanks. }

# 20. WHAT ABOUT RICHARD? (6, 8, 9, 10, 12)
{410}{}{Richard? We found him dead in one of the gutters like one of those jet crashers. Near as we can figure,
 someone pumped him with drugs until he was dead.}
{411}{}{'Someone' gave him too much? How do you know he didn't overdose because HE took too much?}
{412}{}{Who do you figure might have done it?}
{413}{}{Sorry to hear that. I had some other questions…}
{414}{}{Nasty. Look, I have to be going. }

# 21. GAVE HIM TOO MUCH? (20)
{420}{}{Cause he was a clean kid… Mom taught him THAT much. And if you feel like saying any different, maybe you and I should settle
 it right here, huh?!}
{421}{}{I didn't mean it like that. Sorry I brought it up.}
{422}{}{Don't blind yourself to the possibility he might have been taking it. Jet is extremely addictive.}
{423}{}{Look, *kid,* if you know what's good for you, you'll stop throwing down every time a little truth comes along and bites you in the ass.}
{425}{}{I'm not looking for any trouble. I'll be going. }

# 22. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT (21)
{435}{}{Yeah... well, just watch it. Them's fighting words to any Wright, so don't go shooting off your mouth like that, okay?}
{437}{}{Look, KID, don't start with me. If you know what's good for you, you'll stop trying to throw down every time a little truth comes along and bites you in the ass.}
{438}{}{Sorry, no offense intended. Say, I had some other questions…}
{439}{}{Understood. I better be going. }

# 23. APOLOGY FAILED (15, 21, 22)
{445}{}{Piss off. I ain't got nothing more to say to you.}
{446}{}{Wait, I just had one more question…}
{447}{}{I'm leaving, I'm leaving. }

# 24. IMPLY RICH KEPT TAKING DRUGS (15, 21, 22, 23)
{455}{}{(Chris stares at you for a moment, then lunges at you!)}
{456}{}{So THIS is how it's gonna BE, huh? ALL RIGHT THEN, LET'S GO, MOTHER FU -- }

# 25. WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT? (20, 21)
{465}{}{My guess is the Mordinos, either one of their dealers or one of the Mordino family themselves. Bastards make tons of Jet.}
{466}{}{Got it. Say, I had some other questions…}
{467}{}{Which of the dealers do you think sold it to Richard?}
{468}{}{I see. I better be going. }

# 26. WHO DO YOU THINK SOLD IT? (25)
{475}{}{Could have been any one of them: Jagged Jimmy J, that scarred prick at the corner of Virgin Street, or Renesco
 'the Rocketman,' that weasely old shit who sells Jet outta that fortified shell up on the West Side.}
{476}{}{Any other dealers?}

# 27. WHO DO YOU THINK SOLD IT? (28)
{485}{}{Hey, man, thank YOU. }
{486}{}{Hey, lady, thank YOU. }
{487}{}{You find out who killed my brother, and all of Family Wright'll be thanking you. And that's no small thanks, understand?}
{488}{}{I understand. Catch you later, Chris. }

# 28. ANYBODY ELSE? (26)
{495}{}{Jules at the head of town also sells Jet, but he mostly sells to tourists…then there's Little Jesus Mordino: he mighta pushed drugs on Rich while Rich was out alone. He hangs out at the Desperado.}
{497}{}{Jagged Jimmy J, Renesco the Rocketman, Jules and Little Jesus…I'll check them out. Thanks for the info, Chris. }
