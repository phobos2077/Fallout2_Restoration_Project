{100}{}{You see a short, slender woman wearing a blue velvet sun dress.}
{101}{}{You see Ariel, the widow.}
{102}{}{You see a short, slender woman wearing a blue velvet sun dress.  She appears to be sad.}
{103}{}{Hello, I'm Ariel. I don't think I've seen you here before. Who are you?}
{104}{}{Me }
{105}{}{Uh... you look sad. Why?}
{106}{}{Me go now.}
{107}{}{Hello, Ariel, my name is }
{108}{}{Hi. You're looking rather down. What's up?}
{109}{}{You don't need to know my name, but I need some information from you.}
{110}{}{Sorry. I don't have time for this.}
{111}{}{It's a pleasure to meet you. What can I help you with?}
{112}{}{Answer questions?}
{113}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{114}{}{You can't possibly be of any help to me. Bye.}
{115}{}{I'd like to ask you some questions.}
{116}{}{I'm sorry to intrude on your solitude, but could you answer some questions?}
{117}{}{I'm just having some personal problems. It's nothing, really.}
{118}{}{You talk, me listen. It help.}
{119}{}{Ok. No talk problem. Answer question?}
{120}{}{I'm a good listener, Ariel, and talking about whatever is bothering you may just help.}
{121}{}{Ok. Let's forget the problems for now. Can you answer some questions?}
{122}{}{Everybody's got problems, woman. Learn to deal with them.}
{123}{}{Forgive me, but I don't have the time for someone with your attitude. Good-day.}
{124}{}{}
{125}{}{}
{126}{}{All right.}
{127}{}{What do you want to know?}
{128}{}{You prisoner?}
{129}{}{D'claws treat you ok?}
{130}{}{Want leave?}
{131}{}{So why sad?}
{132}{}{How you come here?}
{133}{}{Got go now.}
{134}{}{Are you a prisoner here?}
{135}{}{Are you treated all right by the deathclaws?}
{136}{}{Would you like to leave the vault?}
{137}{}{So tell me, Ariel: Why are you so sad?}
{138}{}{How did you come to be here at the vault?}
{139}{}{I must be going now.}
{140}{}{No, I can leave anytime I want. The deathclaws have made that very clear to me. They don't hold
 anyone here against their will, as far as I know.}
{141}{}{Uh, okay.}
{142}{}{Got it. Me go.}
{143}{}{I see.}
{144}{}{I think you're lying, bitch.}
{145}{}{I see. If you don't mind, I need to ask you about a few more things.}
{146}{}{Yes. They provide me with food, water, shelter, and protection. I feel very safe here, and
 that's more than I could ask for.}
{147}{}{Okay. Got go then.}
{148}{}{Good. Ask more.}
{149}{}{All right. I need to ask you more.}
{150}{}{Okay. On to some other stuff, then.}
{151}{}{Great. A lizard lover.}
{152}{}{I've considered it, but I would have to say no. I feel safer here than anywhere else I've ever
 lived. I do get lonely for the company of other people like myself, but hopefully others will come to
 live here in the future and satisfy that need.}
{153}{}{Me go. Wavy bye bye.}
{154}{}{Tell more.}
{155}{}{Fine, you can rot here for all I care.}
{156}{}{Okay. I guess I'll go now.}
{157}{}{You've been very helpful, but I must trouble you for more.}
{158}{}{My husband recently died. I miss him and I'm having problems adjusting. That's all.}
{159}{}{Sorry, how happen?}
{160}{}{Ooops. Got go, hear elder calling.}
{161}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. How did it happen?}
{162}{}{Tough break. I'll be seeing ya.}
{163}{}{Shit happens, people die. Usually when I'm around.}
{164}{}{I've already told you about the raid. That's when it happened.}
{165}{}{My husband and I were travelling with a caravan on its way to the New California Republic. We
 wanted to start a new life for ourselves and our daughter, Sandy. Unfortunately, the caravan was
 attacked by raiders one night. They were incredibly brutal. They killed everyone: men, women, and
 children. Rand, my husband, died trying to defend Sandy and me. We were to die next when a miracle
 occurred. }
{166}{}{Uh... wow.}
{167}{}{Glad you, little one, both okay.}
{168}{}{Me outta here. Bye.}
{169}{}{Wow. What a story.}
{170}{}{What a crock of sh... I'm outta here.}
{171}{}{Thank goodness that you and your daughter are safe.}
{172}{}{Hello again. How are you?}
{173}{}{}
{174}{}{}
{175}{}{Go away, you bastard! I want nothing to do with you.}
{176}{}{Go away, bitch! I have nothing to say to you.}
{177}{}{Bye.}
{178}{}{.}
{179}{}{. Yes, I'm new here.}
{180}{}{I was holding Sandy behind me, trying to keep her from the monster that had shot Rand. He stood
 next to my husband's body and laughed at me as he aimed his gun at my head. Suddenly, this huge claw
 came out of the darkness, grabbed him from behind and... well, thank goodness that Sandy didn't see
 what happened next. Anyway, the raiders were being wiped out by this group of deathclaws. The one that
 saved Sandy and me stood near us and talked to me. He kept reassuring me that I was safe, and that he
 was sorry that he couldn't have gotten there sooner to help us. Afterwards, the deathclaws brought us
 here.}
