{103}{}{Man... Wong sure is a slave driver.}
{104}{}{Work, work, work. That's all we're good for.}
{105}{}{We'll change the wasteland with this experiment!}
{106}{}{Look out, wasteland! We have something for you!}
{107}{}{I want to see the sun again.}
{108}{}{Mix this. Mix that. I get so bored sometimes.}
{109}{}{Did you see the newest results of the big experiment! Most pleasing!}

{116}{}{Ha! Teach those spies to try to break in!}

{144}{}{We're doing good work here! Don't ruin it!}
{145}{}{We're trying to save the wasteland, you idiot!}
{146}{}{No! Not our scientists!}
{147}{}{Help! Guards!}
