# 0. QUICK LOOK [FEMALE]
{100}{}{You see the lead researcher, Marjorie Reed.}

# 0. LOOK [FEMALE]
{150}{}{You see a tired-looking woman. Her head has been shaved bald, and she is wearing a white coat.}
{151}{}{You see Marjorie Reed. She is filling a hypodermic, grumbling slightly to herself.}

# 1. FLOAT (COMPANION = MYRON)
{200}{}{Hello, Myron.}
{201}{}{Myron, do you have a minute…?}
{202}{}{Any more word when new slaves will be delivered, Myron?}
{203}{}{Myron, these new results are very promising…}
{204}{}{Myron, a minute of your time?}

# 2. FLOAT (NORMAL)
{215}{}{Where the hell is Myron…}
{216}{}{Get Myron up here. He has to see this.}
{217}{}{Wish these slaves would shut up…}
{218}{}{Where did I leave that syringe…}
{219}{}{Has anyone seen No. 31? He was here just a second ago.}
{220}{}{Have the slaves bring more of the Jet Beta.}
{221}{}{Test results from Jet Beta are very promising, but…}
{222}{}{"High" lasts 15 min to an hour…calculate one dose/hour period…hmmmmnnn.}
{223}{}{No. 12 still keeps having nasal bleeding…}
{224}{}{That's the fifth time No. 12 has had seizures…up the dose, see what happens…}
{225}{}{Well, what SORT of hallucinations was he having?}
{226}{}{Check that one's heart rate. If it's still within tolerable limits, up the dosage.}
{227}{}{Why did the slave in the control group kill herself? We weren't even testing her!}
{228}{}{Damn guards can keep track of their own asses…}

# 3. CLICK (COMPANION = MYRON)
{235}{}{Hello, Myron, sir. Tests are proceeding as scheduled.}
{236}{}{Myron, sir, this new strain of Jet is extremely addictive. The slaves are almost willing to kill each other for it.}
{237}{}{Myron, sir, you'll be pleased to note that the slaves would rather take Jet than eat, it's so potent.}
{238}{}{Who are these people with you, Myron? New subjects?}
{239}{}{Myron, sir, the third test group seem to be doing the best of all the groups.}
{240}{}{Myron, sir, if you have a moment...I think the next test group should include at least three children, sir.}
{241}{}{Myron, sir, No. 46 had a heart attack; we are restricting doses to six times a day from now on.}
{242}{}{Myron, sir, please...we need a new shipment of hypodermics from Vault City. We can't keep re-using these.}
{243}{}{Any more word when new slaves will be delivered, Myron, sir?}
{244}{}{Myron, sir, we moved three slaves from the control group into the test group because of those respiratory failures we had last week.}
{245}{}{Myron, bad news, sir. We had to shoot one slave for trying to escape. What a waste.}
{246}{}{Myron, this new hallucinogen you've developed is promising, but it is not as addictive as jet…}

# 4. INTRO (WTG)
{250}{}{(The bald woman doesn't even look up from her clipboard.) Yes?}
{251}{}{No!}
{252}{}{Yes!}
{253}{}{Heh-heh. You bald. You look like man}
{254}{}{Delenn?}
{255}{}{Wander off}
{256}{}{Who are you?}
{257}{}{Sorry, I thought you were some other bald woman with a clipboard. I'll be going now.}

# 5. RETARD (4)
{265}{}{(The woman looks up and glares at you.) Are you one of the control subjects? As if matters anyway...Guards! Detain this slave!}
{266}{}{Where slave? Me no see one}

# 6. WHO ARE YOU? (4)
{275}{}{Look, I'm VERY busy, so if you don't mind… [Glances up from her clipboard at you, then scowls.] WHO are you? How did you get in here?}
{276}{}{Look, I'm VERY busy, so if you don't mind… [Glances up from her clipboard at you, then scowls.] You again? What do you want now?}
{277}{}{Your barn door's open. Heh-heh…get it? I kill me.}
{278}{}{I'm one of the new personnel assigned here.}
{279}{}{I'm looking for Myron. Is he around?}
{280}{}{Are those test results you have on that clipboard? Can I see them?}
{282}{}{Nevermind. Sorry to bother you.}

# 7. DOOR WAS OPEN (6)
{295}{}{This area is not open for…visitors. Leave or I will call the guards.}
{296}{}{But hey, I had some questions for you…}
{298}{}{Are those test results you have on that clipboard? Can I see them? I'm something of a researcher myself.}
{300}{}{Very well. Sorry to bother you.}

# 8. BUT HEY. . . (7, 24)
{310}{}{Guards! Guards, detain this person!}

# 9. I'M ONE OF THE NEW PERSONNEL (6, 7)
{315}{}{MORE guards. Ha! As if they do any good…look, you SHOULD have received instructions from whoever sent you here. Talk
 to the other guards to find out your assignment. Now go.}
{316}{}{I'm not a guard; I'm one of the new researchers. Do you have an assignment for me?}
{317}{}{Excuse me, but I was hoping YOU could show me around. I saw you standing over here and
 felt COMPELLED to talk to you. Perhaps after the tour we could have dinner…?}
{318}{}{Thanks. You've been very helpful.}

# 10. I'M ONE OF THE NEW RESEARCHERS (6, 7, 9)
{325}{}{You're a RESEARCHER...? Hmmmm. I've never seen you before. How much do you know about pharmaceutical research?}
{326}{}{Uh, enough. Just sit back and watch me go.}
{327}{}{I know a fair amount about the composition and manufacture of base neurochemical compounds, and I think I
 could be of some assistance in your studies.}
{328}{}{I have to be going.}

# 11. I'M ONE OF THE NEW RESEARCHERS (10)
{335}{}{Ha! I think I'll just watch you go, period. Leave before I call the guards.}
{336}{}{All right.}
{337}{}{I'm going…::mumble::…you bald-headed bitch.}

# 12. I KNOW QUITE A BIT ABOUT BASE NEUROCHEMCIAL COMPOUNDS . . . (10)
{345}{}{Hmmmm. All right then. Let me give you a run-down on what we do here: we test the effects and potency of a metamphetamine
 called Jet.}
{346}{}{I see. And how is the research coming?}
{347}{}{I think I have the idea. I'll examine the rest of the testing area myself.}

# 13. I SEE. AND HOW IS THE RESEARCH COMING? (12, 22, 25)
{355}{}{Not so well. Our schedule is tight, and we need to purify the Jet manufacturing process soon.}
{356}{}{Why? Jet seems addictive enough already.}
{357}{}{Why the tight schedule?}
{358}{}{Sounds like a tough job. Look, I have to take care of something real quick - I'll be back.}

# 14. WHY THE TIGHT SCHEDULE? (13)
{365}{}{No one's come out and said it, but it's probably due to Jet distribution in Redding. Jet's potent *enough,* but
 there's a good deal of room for improvement, and the 'brass' wants to increase Jet addiction in Redding.}
{366}{}{What's the deal with Redding?}
{367}{}{Well, good luck meeting the schedule.}

# 15. WHY? JET SEEMS ADDICTIVE ENOUGH ALREADY . . . (13)
{375}{}{It's potent *enough,* but there's room for improvement. The 'brass' wants to increase Jet distribution in
 Redding, and they want the addiction rate as close to 100% as we can get it. It's going to require us pulling some long hours.}
{377}{}{Thanks for the information. I'll be back later.}

# 16. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH REDDING? (14, 15)
{385}{}{Addict the miners in Redding to Jet, and whoever controls the Jet, controls Redding. Typical power play.}
{386}{}{So…who does control the drugs?}

# 17. SO WHO DOES CONTROL THE DRUGS? (16)
{395}{}{Who controls the drugs? The Mordinos. Of course, Myron laid all the groundwork for Jet's composition.
 We do mostly clean-up work.}
{396}{}{Is Myron your boss?}

# 18. MYRON'S OUR BOSS? (17)
{405}{}{You COULD call it that. He's a smart one, I'll give him that, but he doesn't care much about what goes
 on up here. He mostly stays in the basement vault…no visitors except for the train of prostitutes. Typical project leader.}
{406}{}{Could I see him?}
{407}{}{Yeah, though marketing's worse. Anyway, thanks for the information. I'll be back later.}

# 19. COULD I SEE HIM? (18)
{415}{}{I suppose…let me give you a temporary badge; just show it to the guards. Keep it quick, though, Myron doesn't
 like people staying long.}
{416}{}{I suppose…let me give you a temporary badge; just show it to the guards. Keep it quick, though, Myron doesn't
 like people staying long…though he may make an exception in your case.}
{417}{}{Thanks for the badge. I'll see you later.}

# 20. EXCUSE ME FOR BEING FORWARD (FEMALE) (9)
{425}{}{Look, I'm VERY busy, so if you don't mind…}
{426}{}{Look, I…I'm, uh, very busy, so if you would please excuse me…}
{427}{}{Nevermind then...}
{428}{}{Thanks anyway.}
{429}{}{Thanks anyway...::mumble:: …you uppity cue-balled bitch.}

# 21. EXCUSE ME FOR BEING FORWARD (GOOD) (9)
{435}{}{This…hmm…I'm VERY flattered, but I'm also very busy at the moment…so…uh…}
{436}{}{Well, do you mind if I came by and picked you up after work then? No pressure…just some dinner, some
 conversation. You look like someone who might need to take a little break from work. Things here must keep you very busy.}
{437}{}{Well, I had to ask. Thanks anyway.}

# 22. DO YOU MIND IF I PICKED YOU UP AFTER WORK . . .? (21)
{445}{}{Oh, not THAT busy…heh…well, no, pretty busy. I mean, mostly it's routine drug testing, and occasionally we have
 a slave go over the edge…}
{446}{}{Doesn't purposely injecting experimental metamphetamines into enslaved humans make you question your basic humanity?}
{447}{}{Wow. That sounds dangerous. You ever get hurt? Do you have many patient fatalities?}
{448}{}{Drug testing? Really? How are things going?}
{449}{}{Sounds interesting, but I have to go….uh, I'll be back, though.}

# 23. DON'T YOU EVER QUESTION YOUR HUMANITY? (22)
{455}{}{Was that some poor attempt at a joke?}
{456}{}{Just asking. I mean, what if you had been sold into slavery, been taken here, then pumped full of drugs?}
{457}{}{Uh, yes. I have to be going.}

# 24. PUMPED FULL OF DRUGS? (23)
{465}{}{I'm on THIS side of the stalls, they're on THAT side. Since we're getting into hypotheticals, would
 YOU like to find out what it's like to be them? We have an extra stall or two.}
{466}{}{Now hold on a minute…}
{467}{}{Uh, no thanks. Sorry to bother you.}

# 25. PATIENT FATALTIES (22)
{475}{}{Slave deaths? A few. Mostly accidental overdoses - usually a tech's fault - or self-inflicted injuries.
 Some ingest too much Jet, and they REALLY want to fly.}
{476}{}{Other than that, how's the drug testing going?}
{477}{}{I bet. Well, thanks for the information. You've been very helpful.}

# 26. ACTUALLY, I WAS LOOKING FOR MYRON (6)
{485}{}{Try downstairs in the lab. The guarded door. If you see him, tell him to come up here when he has the
 chance. IF he's not too busy.}

# GET BADGE MESSAGE
{1000}{}{You get a temporary pass from Marjorie.}
