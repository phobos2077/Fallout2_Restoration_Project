{100}{}{You see a young woman, very much a tomboy, dressed in work overalls.}
{101}{}{It's Dorothy, the city engineer.}
{102}{}{From all the grease and dirt on her, she's a hands-on tool type, especially since that maintainence bot follows her everywhere.}
{103}{}{Oh my god, somebody's got to do something! What do I do? I need some help quick.}
{104}{}{Huh? Gug?}
{105}{}{What's going on?}
{106}{}{You come. Stop bad man. Stop him no break machine. Okay?}
{107}{}{Okay.}
{108}{}{No, no come.}
{109}{}{Oh, god, it's Jack. He's threatening to blow up the power plant. There's no time, you have to stop him for me. You can do that, can't you?}
{110}{}{Stop wasting time. Lead on.}
{111}{}{Not my job. Go find somebody else.}
{112}{}{Listen - Jack's inside. He's upset about his ex-wife. Things haven't been good for him lately. He says he's got a bomb. If so, it's probably right alongside the generating dynamo. Look, see if you can talk him out of it, but whatever you do don't let that bomb go off!}
{113}{}{How am I supposed to do that?}
{114}{}{Don't worry, I'm on it.}
{115}{}{I don't know! I'm just the city engineer. You figure it out!}
{116}{}{Crap! He's damaged the core unit. It's got to be fixed before things really go to hell. You any good at repairing things?}
{117}{}{Urrgh.}
{118}{}{Yes.}
{119}{}{No}
{120}{}{What was I thinking?}
{121}{}{Look, do what you can with the generator. I've got to stablize the core. You've got about 30 seconds, I think. After that it'll be too late. Come on, Toto.}
{122}{}{Damn! Then stand back. Unless I'm real lucky, the whole thing's going to blow. Let's go, Toto.}
{123}{}{You fixed it? Without any parts? That's amazing! Where'd you learn to do that?}
{124}{}{Huh-huh!}
{125}{}{Just handy that's all.}
{126}{}{I get it. You're one of those moron types - what do they call them? Idiot savants. Well look, idiot or not, you've earned a reward. RE-WARD - you. I give you pretty books.  You see. Get money. Good... Not like you can read, after all.}
{127}{}{Look, it's not much, but I've got some books - old tech manuals. They're yours. Take them.}
{128}{}{Hey look, Toto. It's the stranger who helped us out. Thanks again, mister.}
{129}{}{Crap! The whole grid's down. This is going to take forever to fix. No time to talk. Come on, Toto.}
{130}{}{Look, I don't blame you for what happened, but I'm not in a real chatty mood.}
{131}{}{You killed him! I mean, did you have to kill him? Wasn't there some other way?}
{132}{}{Yes.}
{133}{}{No.}
{134}{}{You should have tried it then, instead of just killing him. Get out of here, you monster!}
{135}{}{It's terrible. I wonder what made him do it? The town owes you its thanks. Look, it's not much, but here's some manuals I've been collecting. Maybe you can sell them or something.}
{136}{}{Don't talk to me, you murdering swine.}
{137}{}{Can't chat, stranger. Name's Dorothy, city engineer, and that's Toto. Got to run.}
{138}{}{You don't have an illudium Q-38 space modulator, do you? Didn't think so.}
{139}{}{You talked him out of it? That's amazing! The town owes you big, mister. Look, it's not much, but here's some manuals I've been collecting. Maybe you can sell them or something.}
{140}{}{I just want you to know I'm still impressed by what you did with Jack. Me and Toto have to run now. `Bye!}
{141}{}{Crap! I got one word of advice-RUN!}

{142}{}{Hey look, Toto. It's the stranger who helped us out. Thanks again, miss.}
{143}{}{You talked him out of it? That's amazing! The town owes you big, sister. Look, it's not much, but here's some manuals I've been collecting. Maybe you can sell them or something.}

{144}{}{Don't waste time! He's serious.}
{145}{}{You've got to do something right now!}
{146}{}{Don't just stand there -- stop him!}
{147}{}{Just get out of here, brahmin dung.}
{148}{}{Don't talk to me, you coward.}
{149}{}{What use are you!?}
