{100}{}{You see an attractive young woman.}
{101}{}{You see a bath attendant.}
{102}{}{You see one of Big Nose Sally’s girls.}
{103}{}{You see a bored looking woman.}
{104}{}{You see a woman checking you out.}
{105}{}{You’re being mentally undressed by this woman.}
{106}{}{You see a young woman.}

{110}{}{You see an attractive young woman. Her face is covered with a light dusting of some kind of
 white powder.}
{111}{}{You see a middle-aged woman with an ample bosom.}
{112}{}{You see an attractive woman wearing partially fastened clothing.}
{113}{}{You see a woman looking you over appraisingly…with a grimace on her face.}

{120}{}{That was quick.}
{121}{}{Been a long time, honey?}
{122}{}{Maybe it will last longer next time.}
{123}{}{It’s not a race, you know.}
{124}{}{Do your friends call you ‘Speedy’?}
{125}{}{If all my customers were that quick, I could go home early.}
{126}{}{It’s more fun if you wait ‘til I help you.}
{127}{}{If you waited until I undressed, I bet you’d like it more.}

{130}{}{That was real nice. You’re a real man, all right.}
{131}{}{That was special. You’re wonderful. Next!}
{132}{}{Oh yeah, baby, never had it like that before. (yawn)}
{133}{}{You’re the best. Come back soon.}
{134}{}{I’m sure you’ll make some tribal gal very happy.}
{135}{}{No, honey, size doesn’t matter at all. That was nice.}
{136}{}{Aren’t you just a hunk o’ hunk o’ burnin’ love.}
{137}{}{What a cute little feller you got there.}

{140}{}{Size does matter! Sweet mystery of life…. }
{141}{}{I’m putting in for overtime next time you come around.}
{142}{}{You sure get your money’s worth.}
{143}{}{I’m taking the rest of the day off.}
{144}{}{Wow! Did the earth move for you, too?}
{145}{}{Now I know what Catherine the Great felt like.}

{150}{}{Well, a buck’s a buck, I guess.}
{151}{}{That was, uh, different, I guess.}
{152}{}{That was real special. Next!}
{153}{}{No, you can’t use my perfume.}
{154}{}{Well, at least your mustache is smaller than most of my customers'.}
{155}{}{You’re sure you’re a gal?}

{160}{}{That was kinda nice.}
{161}{}{That was different, but not a bad different.}
{162}{}{I think I’d like to try that again sometime.}
{163}{}{We should do that off-the-clock sometime.}
{164}{}{That was sweet, sugar.}
{165}{}{Wow! My life’s going to be a lot different from here on in.}
{166}{}{I didn’t know it could be like that.}

{170}{}{You should go talk to Big Nose Sally.}
{171}{}{Aren’t you a cutey?}
{172}{}{Love you long-time!}
{173}{}{Come up and see me sometime.}
{174}{}{You know how to whistle doncha?}
{175}{}{I used to be pure as snow, but then I drifted.}
{176}{}{(Wolf whistles)}
{177}{}{Hey there, tiger.}
{178}{}{Hey, baaaaaby.}
{179}{}{Go talk to Sally if you want some action.}
{180}{}{Scrub a-dub-dub...}
{181}{}{Looks like you could use a wash.}
{182}{}{Oh, a tribal; I just love exotics.}
{183}{}{I don’t usually do tribals.}
{184}{}{Like what you see, baby?}
{185}{}{You want me?}
{186}{}{Gotta pay to play, sugar.}
