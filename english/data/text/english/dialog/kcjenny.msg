{200}{}{Gee, mister, that was pretty quick. You must be pretty new at this sort of thing. Just relax a
 bit and you’ll enjoy it more.}
{201}{}{Thanks, Jenny; I guess I need some more practice at this.}

{210}{}{That was nice. You seem like you know your way around a woman better than most men your age.}
{211}{}{I’m glad that you had as much fun as I did.}

{220}{}{You really have a lot of staying power. That’s the nice thing about younger men. Sure wish
 there were more like you in town.}
{221}{}{I sure enjoyed that bath, Jenny. I could go for a little more if I didn’t have other things
 that I had to do.}

{230}{}{Well, that was different. I hope you come back; I think I’d like to experiment with some ideas
 of my own next time.}
{231}{}{It’s nice being with someone who understands what I need for a change.}

{240}{}{That sure was fun. You could be a real knockout if we got you out of those tribal duds. I
 wouldn’t mind having you stick around for a while, sister. Ever considered a career change?}
{241}{}{I enjoyed myself, too. I have a lot of things to do before I could consider settling down just
 yet. But, thanks anyway.}

{250}{}{You're different from the usual group around here.}
{251}{}{Tell me about what goes on here.}
{252}{}{I don’t think I want to know about what goes on here.}

{260}{}{Well, it’s been nice chattin’ with you. I better get ready for another customer, though. Goodbye.}

{270}{}{You look a little confused. My name’s Jenny; can I help you?}
{271}{}{Enny? Goo heh heh heh. (smile)}
{272}{}{(nods) Hep }
{273}{}{ perdy Enny}
{274}{}{Mommy?}

{280}{}{Hmm, I think you just better clear out of here before Big Nose Sally finds you. She doesn’t
 take kindly to idjits in her place.}

{290}{}{What would you like to know?}
{291}{}{Tell me about trappers.}
{292}{}{I’m looking for a trader. Know any of them that deal in old items, like from the beforetimes?}
{293}{}{Do you happen to know how to get to the Den from here?}
{294}{}{Bye.}
{295}{}{Jenny, have you ever heard of something called a GECK?}

{300}{}{Well, there’s not much to tell about the trappers, really. They get a few gecko pelts...or get
 lucky with a few golden geckos...and then they come in to blow off some steam. Quick and not too
 demanding —- just the way I like ‘em.}
{301}{}{I guess that’s all I need to know for now.}
{302}{}{Interesting; let me ask you about something else.}

{310}{}{You’re interested in traders, huh? Well I mostly just worked for one trader. Vic was his name.
 He always had extra money to blow, at least when he worked he did. See, he specialized in really old stuff. You know,
 technical thingies.}
{311}{}{Well, thanks for the info. I think I’ll go now.}
{312}{}{Tell me more about Vic.}
{313}{}{Let me ask you about something else.}

{320}{}{Vic was a real sweetheart. He would go off for weeks at a time and then come back with all
 kinds of beforetime things. But he often had to travel to the Den to sell them. Not much call for
 that sort of stuff ‘round here.}
{321}{}{Where’s Vic now?}
{322}{}{Where’s the Den?}
{323}{}{Did Vic ever have anything that was labeled ‘Vault-Tek’?}
{324}{}{Tell me something else.}
{325}{}{I think that’s all I need to know.}

{330}{}{The Den is a hive of scum and villainy southeast of here. I guess about a week or so? Don’t
 remember too clearly. Anyhow, it’s an exciting place. Dangerous, but exciting. Sorry to leave there,
 in a way.}
{331}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{332}{}{I think I’ll leave now, thanks.}

{340}{}{I don’t rightly know where Vic is. I know he has a house just down the street from us, to the
 east. He could be out trading with tribals or even in the Den, for all I know. I hope he’s okay. He was
 getting to be more than just a steady customer to me.}
{341}{}{I hope he’s okay, for your sake. Let me ask you another question.}
{342}{}{I hope he comes back to you. I think I’ll go now. Goodbye.}

{350}{}{Hello there, mister. My name's Jenny. Looking for a good scrub-down?}
{351}{}{Uh, no thanks; I was just looking around.}
{352}{}{Actually, I could use a bit of a rub (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).}
{353}{}{Well, actually, I just had a few questions that I wanted to ask you if you don’t mind.}
{354}{}{I’m looking for information about a trader of beforetime stuff.}

{360}{}{Hello there, miss. My name's Jenny. Can I help you?}
{361}{}{Uh, no; I just wanted to see what was in here. But I think I better go.}
{362}{}{Actually, I could pick up some personal beauty tips from a cutie like you.}
{363}{}{I just had a few questions that I wanted to ask you.}
{364}{}{I’m looking for information about a certain trader of beforetime stuff.}

{370}{}{Well then, you better talk to Big Nose Sally. She makes all the business arrangements for us
 and she doesn’t take kindly to any freelance work.}

{380}{}{Hello there, cute stuff. My name's Jenny. You looking for work here? If you move as good as you
 look, you could really make some good money here.}
{381}{}{I’m really not interested in a job here.}
{382}{}{Mmm, I’d love to show you, personally, just how good I can move.}
{383}{}{Thanks, but I think I just need to ask you some questions.}
{384}{}{I’m looking for information about a trader. He deals in beforetime things.}

{390}{}{Vault-tek? He might have had something like that. I’m not sure. I know he did have a lot of
 really old stuff.}
{391}{}{Thanks, Jenny. Let me ask you something else.}
{392}{}{Well I guess that’s all I need for now.}

{400}{}{A Geck? What’s that? Some kind of small gecko, I’d guess. Sorry, I don’t know what else it
 would be.}
{401}{}{Thanks, Jenny. Let me ask you something else.}
{402}{}{Well, I guess that’s all I need for now.}

{500}{}{[Jenny slaps you] Please don't grope me like that!}
