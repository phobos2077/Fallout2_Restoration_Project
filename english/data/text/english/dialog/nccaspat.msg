{325}{}{Way to crush the Enclave, }
{326}{}{With the destruction of the Enclave, you've made this casino a better place for my children. How can I ever thank you?}
{327}{}{The Enclave never messed with me, but I'm glad they're gone.}
{328}{}{I can't believe the Enclave were still fighting the war after all this time. Idiots.}
{329}{}{I felt a great disturbance…as if a hundred evil bastards on an oil derrick suddenly cried out in terror
 and were suddenly silenced. Strange.}

{342}{}{Uh, hello, sir…or ma'am…or whatever you are.}
{343}{}{Give my regards to whoever gave that armor to you.}
{344}{}{Anything wrong, sir…ma'am…uh, whatever you are?}
{345}{}{Are you one of the new bouncers? Or some new walking arcade game?}
{346}{}{No, I'm NOT going to oil your joints.}
{347}{}{Can your armor transform into a jet and fly around? Just curious.}
{348}{}{Yeah, yeah, 'clank-whirrr-clank' to you, too.}
