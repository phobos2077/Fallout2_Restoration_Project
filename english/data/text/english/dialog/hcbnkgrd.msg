{100}{}{You see a big, burly mutant with a sense of purpose in his eyes.}
{101}{}{You see one of the bank guards, a large, tough mutant.}
{102}{}{You see a well-armed, alert guard; a mutant who carries a rather wicked-looking weapon.}

{103}{}{Can I help you?}
{104}{}{Agga agga!}
{105}{}{Me in building! Oooh!}
{106}{}{Just looking around.}
{107}{}{Err… no, not really.}
{108}{}{Yeah. I’m here to talk to your prisoners.}
{109}{}{Have you considered that you may be holding your prisoners illegally?}

{110}{}{Oh, great, another one of you. Please leave.}
{111}{}{Aaaaahn!}
{112}{}{O-kay!}

{113}{}{Yeah, well, look somewhere else. We got criminals here. Go.}
{114}{}{Oh. All right.}

{115}{}{We can help everyone who comes here for a reason. If you can’t be helped, then you gotta go. Get going before we help you.}
{116}{}{Gonna make me?}
{117}{}{Got it.}

{118}{}{You’re here to talk to them, eh? Well, you can talk to us. What do you have to say?}
{119}{}{Have you considered that you’re holding them illegally?}
{120}{}{Eat this, mutie!}
{121}{}{Nothing. I’ll be going now.}

{122}{}{Err… what do you mean?}
{123}{}{What I mean is that they have committed no crimes except for their speech. They have only spoken ill of mutants. I’m not saying they won’t commit a crime… but would you want to be detained for a crime you MIGHT commit?}
{124}{}{That power makes the law. I have the power. Right here.}

{125}{}{No, I wouldn’t, but they’re clearly dangerous.}
{126}{}{Until they commit a crime, they’re guilty of no crime. Until they’ve actually laid their plans and begun the execution of the crime, they’re not guilty. Right?}
{127}{}{Dangerous? I’m dangerous. You’re dangerous. We’re not in jail.}
{128}{}{So what?}

{129}{}{But… but… all right. They’re out. You’re accountable. I just hope you’re right. Here is the key.}
{130}{}{That’s all I wanted. Great. Thanks. Bye.}

{131}{}{Yeah, but maybe we should be. Right now, they are. And they’re staying there until someone can show me a better reason to let them out. Now… get out.}
{132}{}{No.}
{133}{}{All right.}

{134}{}{So they’re going to stay in jail for now. We gotta protect society. Now… get out.}
{135}{}{No.}
{136}{}{All right.}

{137}{}{You! What the hell are you doing? Get the hell out of here!}

{138}{}{You’ll be putting your weapons away now, pal.}

{139}{}{You again? What do you want?}
{140}{}{Just looking around.}
{141}{}{Err… no, not really.}
{142}{}{Yeah. I’m here to talk to your prisoners.}
{143}{}{Have you considered that you may be holding your prisoners illegally?}

{144}{}{You shouldn't be hanging around here. Leave now.}
{145}{}{If I ever find out where those damn prisoners ran off to, there's gonna be hell to pay!}
