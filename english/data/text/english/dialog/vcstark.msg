{100}{}{You see Citizen Sergeant Stark.}
{101}{}{You see a huge black man in heavy armor. He's watching you carefully.}
{102}{}{You see Citizen Sergeant Stark.}
{103}{}{You see a huge black man in heavy armor. He's watching you carefully.}
{104}{}{Good job down south. Saw the fireworks all the way up here.}
{105}{}{Good day... sir.}
{106}{}{Vault City prevails... sir.}
{107}{}{Good day, Citizen.}
{108}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{109}{}{You'll wish you stayed out of the city... Guards!}
{110}{}{A mutant! Guards!}
{111}{}{A ghoul! Guards!}
{112}{}{Need to compile those ammunition lists...}
{113}{}{Need to check the weapon lockers down in the Vault tomorrow...}
{114}{}{Maybe being in these cells will teach you to behave yourselves.}
{115}{}{And you'll STAY in these cells until the First Citizen pardons you.}
{116}{}{I'm sorry, Citizen, but no one's permitted in the Corrections Center after dark. Come back in the morning.}
{117}{}{It's past curfew. What are you still doing in the city?}
{118}{}{Yah!}
{119}{}{Uh, as a Citizen, I am allowed to be in the city after dark.}
{120}{}{I just had some business to take care of before I left.}
{121}{}{I'm leaving right now.}
{122}{}{Is that so? Well, I know EVERY Citizen in Vault City, and I don't recognize you. Where's your papers?}
{123}{}{You want them? Come get them.}
{124}{}{I don't have them on me.}
{125}{}{Here you go.}
{126}{}{Then stop wasting my time, "Citizen." Come on, let's move it.}
{127}{}{Your business is over for the day. Come on, let's move it.}
{128}{}{I'm not going anywhere. You try and move me, you'll regret it.}
{129}{}{All right, I'm going.}
{130}{}{Captain. Can I help you... sir?}
{131}{}{Can I help you, Citizen?}
{132}{}{What do you want?}
{133}{}{Yah!}
{134}{}{Shamble off}
{135}{}{Who are you?}
{136}{}{Nothing, sorry to disturb you.}
{137}{}{Come with me, boy. NOW.}
{138}{}{Come with me, lady. NOW.}
{139}{}{Me leave? Me leave!}
{140}{}{ME NO GO. NOW.}
{141}{}{You'll wish you left.}
{142}{}{ME NO GO LEFT.}
{143}{}{Sergeant Stark... sir. Did you need something?}
{144}{}{I am Citizen SERGEANT Stark, Citizen. Was there something I could help you with?}
{145}{}{I am Citizen SERGEANT Stark, Outsider. What do you want?}
{146}{}{What do you do here?}
{147}{}{Can you tell me where the Vault is?}
{148}{}{Nothing, sorry to disturb you.}
{149}{}{I do YOUR job, sir.}
{150}{}{I run the Corrections Center. And obey your orders, sir.}
{151}{}{I run the Corrections Center. Keep the Outworlders in line. Make sure the Servants behave. Organize patrols. Try and protect the city from raiders.}
{152}{}{You got a problem, Sergeant?}
{153}{}{You the one who busted up Cassidy's bar?}
{154}{}{Have you heard of a servant named Joshua?}
{155}{}{Patrols?}
{156}{}{Raiders?}
{157}{}{About those Raiders...}
{158}{}{Can I ask you some questions?}
{159}{}{Thanks.  Goodbye.}
{160}{}{Permission to speak freely, sir.}
{161}{}{Granted.}
{162}{}{No. I had some other questions for you, first.}
{163}{}{Not today, Sergeant.}
{164}{}{You don't DESERVE your post. I have lived in Vault City all my life. The men and women under MY command trust me and respect me, not you... sir.}
{165}{}{That's why I need you at your post, Sergeant. There is no doubt that you are capable and know Vault City better than I do. Nevertheless, I have shown RESULTS where you have NOT. Never forget that.}
{166}{}{Noted, Sergeant. Now I have some questions for you.}
{167}{}{Noted, Sergeant. I suggest you swallow your attitude and get on with doing your job. Good day.}
{168}{}{Understood, sir.}
{169}{}{Now I have some questions for you.}
{170}{}{Carry on then, Sergeant.}
{171}{}{Yes, sir. I conducted an authorized raid on Mr. Cassidy's establishment.}
{172}{}{Maybe your friend Cassidy there didn't tell you that he had illegal substances on the premises, and his license for alcohol distribution had expired. You forget to tell your friend here that, Cassidy?}
{173}{}{Cassidy says he was all paid up and you raided his place anyway.}
{174}{}{Forget it. I had some other questions...}
{175}{}{Never mind then.  Goodbye.}
{176}{}{No, sir. Mr. Cassidy had not paid his licensing fee for alcohol for the month, yet was still selling it on the premises. His list of payments are logged in the computer.}
{177}{}{Cassidy was guilty of possession without a license. He doesn't like it, he can leave Vault City. That simple.}
{178}{}{I believe you, Sergeant. Well done. Now listen to me: I want you to pardon Mr. Cassidy, wipe his record clean, and pay him restitution for the damages you caused his establishment.}
{179}{}{You know, I think my fist and your face are about to have a conversation.}
{180}{}{Forget it. I had some other questions...}
{181}{}{Nevermind then. Goodbye.}
{182}{}{Thanks for looking out for me, friend. Stark's one stubborn sonuvabitch.}
{183}{}{Just try it. I'll look forward to putting trash like you and Cassidy in their place.}
{184}{}{Fine. I was looking forward to kicking your ass anyway.}
{185}{}{Forget it. I had some other questions...}
{186}{}{Nevermind then. Goodbye.}
{187}{}{Yes... SIR.}
{188}{}{NOW, Sergeant.}
{189}{}{Come on, Sergeant. Chop-chop.}
{190}{}{Here you are, SIR.}
{191}{}{Now I have some questions for you, Sergeant.}
{192}{}{Very good, Sergeant. Carry on.}
{193}{}{Yeah, he was that drunk Outworlder who struck one of my guards in that brawl in the Spittoon. He's over at the Servant Allocation Center getting... broken in. It's just down the street.}
{194}{}{I had another question...}
{195}{}{Hmmm. I'll head over there now.}
{196}{}{The Vault's right outside the door...sir.}
{197}{}{The Vault's right outside the door. Just tell the guards you're a Citizen, and they'll let you through.}
{198}{}{The Vault's right outside the door. Only Citizens are allowed in there, so I don't want to catch you bothering the guards.}
{199}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{200}{}{But I am a Citizen.}
{201}{}{How do you become a citizen?}
{202}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}
{203}{}{That so? I don't recognize you, and I know every Citizen in Vault City.}
{204}{}{Here's my papers. I think you'll find everything in order.}
{205}{}{Uh, never mind. I had some other questions...}
{206}{}{I better be going.}
{207}{}{Well, well, if it isn't those papers that were stolen last month. Looks like I finally found the culprit. Come with me, Outsider.}
{208}{}{Touch me, and you'll regret it.}
{209}{}{I'm going, I'm going. Stop pushing.}
{210}{}{I was BORN a Citizen. Interested in becoming a Citizen? Find a council member.}
{211}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{212}{}{I will, thanks. Goodbye.}
{213}{}{Yeah, what about them?}
{214}{}{I found their base.}
{215}{}{I wiped them out.}
{216}{}{Any idea where these raiders are striking from?}
{217}{}{Never mind. I had some questions...}
{218}{}{Forget it. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{219}{}{You did? Where is it?}
{220}{}{Yes, you said that before. You should tell the First Citizen if you haven't already.}
{221}{}{Down south, in a series of caves in the mountains. Here, let me point it out...}
{222}{}{I had some questions for you.}
{223}{}{All right. I'll go tell her.}
{224}{}{You wiped them out?}
{225}{}{Yes, you said that before. You should tell the First Citizen if you haven't already.}
{226}{}{Yeah, Vault City shouldn't have to worry about them anymore.}
{227}{}{I had some questions for you.}
{228}{}{All right. I'll go tell her.}
{229}{}{Go tell the First Citizen at once. She'll want to know about this immediately.}
{230}{}{I had some questions first.}
{231}{}{All right. I'll go tell her.}
{232}{}{Yeah, raiders. They've been hitting us pretty hard lately. (Frowns.) Why do you want to know about them?}
{233}{}{I'd like to try and find their base, maybe stop the attacks if I can.}
{234}{}{I was just curious.}
{235}{}{Never mind. I had some questions...}
{236}{}{Forget it. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{237}{}{What, you some kind of good Samaritan? I don't buy it.}
{238}{}{I am not a Samaritan. I'm actually a native of Arroyo - it's a village to the west.}
{239}{}{I'd like to help if I could.}
{240}{}{Look, I've seen enough of the world to know that helping out people seems to come back and help me in the end.}
{241}{}{Never mind. I had some questions...}
{242}{}{Forget it. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{243}{}{What, you come in here to be a smartass? That it?}
{244}{}{Oh, yeah? Well, tackling this band of raiders may be more than you can handle.}
{245}{}{No, but if you need help, I'm willing to help you out.}
{246}{}{I'd still like to try and help.}
{247}{}{Never mind then. I had some questions...}
{248}{}{Forget it. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{249}{}{Hmmm. Well, I ain't going to turn down any help at this point. You find their base, or even better, wipe them out, go tell the First Citizen.}
{250}{}{Actually, I already found their base.}
{251}{}{Actually, I wiped them out already.}
{252}{}{Any idea where these raiders are striking from?}
{253}{}{All right. I had some other questions...}
{254}{}{I'll do that.}
{255}{}{Curious, huh? So am I. Now, what do you know about the raiders?}
{256}{}{I'd like to try and find their base, maybe stop the attacks if I can.}
{257}{}{I don't know anything. That's why I'm asking you.}
{258}{}{Never mind. I had some questions...}
{259}{}{Forget it. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{260}{}{Don't know anything? Maybe I'll keep you here in the Corrections Center until you REMEMBER something.}
{261}{}{I'd like to try and find their base, maybe stop the attacks if I can.}
{262}{}{You got me. I'm obviously in league with the raiders. Arrest me.}
{263}{}{Look, I'm walking out of here right now. If you try and stop me, there's going to be trouble.}
{264}{}{You're already in trouble. You looking to make it worse?}
{265}{}{No, I'd like to try and find their base, maybe stop the attacks if I can.}
{266}{}{You got me. I'm obviously in league with the raiders. Arrest me.}
{267}{}{I'm leaving. You want to stop me? Go ahead.}
{268}{}{All right then...}
{269}{}{Whoa! Whoa! I didn't --}
{270}{}{Bring it on, dead man.}
{271}{}{I don't think we'll be dropping the subject quite that easily. Now... what do you know about the raiders?}
{272}{}{I'd like to try and find their base, maybe stop the attacks if I can.}
{273}{}{I was just curious.}
{274}{}{Look, I'm walking out of here right now. If you try and stop me, there's going to be trouble.}
{275}{}{I don't know. These raiders don't make much sense. IF they are raiders.}
{276}{}{What do you mean?}
{277}{}{I had some other questions...}
{278}{}{I have to be going.}
{279}{}{They've got heavy firepower. Expensive firepower. They know military tactics. They stay in formation. They never cross their lines of fire. And they always stop short of breaking through our defenses.}
{280}{}{Uh... they stop short of breaking through the defenses?}
{281}{}{I had some other questions...}
{282}{}{I have to be going.}
{283}{}{I've seen them do it. The last attack, they disabled a laser turret on the western perimeter. They had a clear shot into the city. Then I saw one of their "captains" ORDER them to fall back. Makes no sense.}
{284}{}{Any idea where they're coming from?}
{285}{}{Hmmm. I had some other questions...}
{286}{}{Interesting. I have to be going.}
{287}{}{No. That's the most frustrating part. They keep retreating south. I can't spare any men to go and scout the area. I think the raiders have some native guide that leads them through the southern canyons.}
{288}{}{What's the deal with the south?}
{289}{}{Hmmm. I had some other questions...}
{290}{}{Interesting. I have to be going.}
{291}{}{Plenty of places to hide if you don't know where to look. The place is riddled with caves.}
{292}{}{I could probably find them.}
{293}{}{I had some other questions...}
{294}{}{Hmmm. I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye.}
{295}{}{Go ahead and try. I'm betting the only way they'd let us find them is by giving us a map.}
{296}{}{I had some other questions...}
{297}{}{If that's what it takes...thanks for the information.}
{298}{}{Yeah, we have a small group of patrols. Can barely spare the men to protect Vault City, much less do all the reconnaissance that needs to be done.}
{299}{}{Recon-o-what?}
{300}{}{I do a lot of travelling. Anything I can help with?}
{301}{}{Sorry to hear that. I had some other questions...}
{302}{}{Never mind then. Goodbye.}
{303}{}{Scouting.}
{304}{}{What do you mean?}
{305}{}{I could do some recon for you if you're short-handed.}
{306}{}{Forget it. I had some other questions...}
{307}{}{Never mind then. Goodbye.}
{308}{}{No, you'd need a Pip Boy to get the job done right, and I can't spare one right now.}
{309}{}{I already got a Pip Boy. It's old... and cranky... and seems to have wires and buttons yanked out everywhere... but it works.}
{310}{}{Well, all right. I had some other questions...}
{311}{}{Never mind then. Goodbye.}
{312}{}{Yeah? Has it got a Northern California world map installed?}
{313}{}{Yes. Well, at least from what I can see through the fog of war on the damn thing.}
{314}{}{I got a job for you, then. I need someone to scout the terrain around Gecko... that ghoul encampment to the northeast. Hit the eight sectors on the world map around the town, then report back.}
{315}{}{Why?}
{316}{}{No problem. I've already scouted out the area.}
{317}{}{All right. I'll come back when I've scouted the area.}
{318}{}{On second thought, count me out. Goodbye.}
{319}{}{If they keep poisoning our groundwater, we may be forced to take military action.}
{320}{}{I want to see how much damage the plant meltdown caused to the area.}
{321}{}{We may be forced to take military action against them in the future, especially if they start poisoning the groundwater again.}
{322}{}{Now do you want the job or not?}
{323}{}{Yes. I've already scouted out the area, though.}
{324}{}{I'll take the job. I'll report back when I'm done.}
{325}{}{I'll take the job. I had some questions first, though...}
{326}{}{No thanks. Maybe some other time.}
{327}{}{That so? Heh. Well... all right then.}
{328}{}{Good job. Download the information into my Pip Boy, and I'll log it into the patrol computers.}
{329}{}{All right...}
{330}{}{This intelligence looks good. Well done. Here's your payment... three hundred dollars.}
{331}{}{All right then...you got any more work for me?}
{332}{}{Great. I had some other questions...}
{333}{}{Thanks. Pleasure doing business with you.}
{334}{}{Yeah, actually... I need someone to travel to NCR. Lately, I've been hearing reports that
 the Republic might be building up military strength. True or not, I need someone to plot a route to NCR and report back.}
{335}{}{No problem. Already done.}
{336}{}{Just travel to NCR, then come back?}
{337}{}{Forget it. I had some other questions...}
{338}{}{No thanks. Goodbye.}
{339}{}{That's all I need. I'm more interested in the route than the Republic itself, but I'll still need you to enter the city once you get there.}
{340}{}{No problem. Already done.}
{341}{}{I'll take the job. I'll report back when I'm done.}
{342}{}{I'll take the job. I had some questions before I left, however...}
{343}{}{No thanks. I had some other questions, though...}
{344}{}{I don't think I want this job. Maybe some other time.}
{345}{}{That so? Heh.}
{346}{}{All right then. Download the information into my Pip Boy, and I'll log it into the patrol computers.}
{347}{}{All right.}
{348}{}{This intelligence looks good. Well done. Here's payment for your services, five hundred dollars... plus, you might find this useful.}
{349}{}{What is it?}
{350}{}{It's a Vault-Tec Motion sensor. We were going to strip it for parts, since it's too old for our Pip Boys, but it looks like it's compatible with your model.}
{351}{}{How does it work?}
{352}{}{Keep it in your hand and it IDs hostiles in your immediate area when you use it. Or you can call up the Pip Boy automap as normal, then just click the "scanner" button and they're lit up like a neon sign.}
{353}{}{Thanks, this could be useful. Say, can I ask you some other questions?}
{354}{}{Much appreciated. I'll go try it out.}
{355}{}{Hello... Captain. Did you want something?}
{356}{}{Hello again, Citizen. Something I can help you with?}
{357}{}{You're back again? You lost, or do you need something?}
{358}{}{Like what... sir?}
{359}{}{Yes, Citizen. What did you want to know?}
{360}{}{Like what?}
{361}{}{Hep-Hep Schlep-Bep}
{362}{}{Shamble off}
{363}{}{You got some kind of problem, Sergeant?}
{364}{}{You the one who busted up Cassidy's bar?}
{365}{}{Have you heard of a Servant named Joshua?}
{366}{}{What do you do here?}
{367}{}{Can you tell me where the Vault is?}
{368}{}{I surveyed the area around Gecko for you.}
{369}{}{Got any more recon work for me?}
{370}{}{I plotted that route to NCR for you.}
{371}{}{About those Raiders...}
{372}{}{Never mind. Goodbye.}
{373}{}{Good day...ma'am.}
{374}{}{Vault City prevails... ma'am.}
{375}{}{Captain. Can I help you... ma'am?}
{376}{}{Sergeant Stark... ma'am. Did you need something?}
{377}{}{I do YOUR job, ma'am.}
{378}{}{I run the Corrections Center. And obey your orders, ma'am.}
{379}{}{Permission to speak freely, ma'am.}
{380}{}{You don't DESERVE your post. I have lived in Vault City all my life. The men and women under MY command trust me and respect me, not you... ma'am.}
{381}{}{Understood, ma'am.}
{382}{}{Yes, ma'am. I conducted an authorized raid on Mr. Cassidy's establishment.}
{383}{}{No, ma'am. Mr. Cassidy had not paid his licensing fee for alcohol for the month, yet was still selling it on the premises. His list of payments are logged in the computer.}
{384}{}{Yes... MA'AM.}
{385}{}{Here you are, MA'AM.}
{386}{}{You pulled rank on Stark to help out your friend Cassidy.}
{387}{}{The Vault's right outside the door... ma'am.}
{388}{}{You have scouted Gecko for Vault City.}
{389}{}{You have scouted NCR for Vault City.}
{390}{}{Like what... ma'am?}
