{100}{}{You see a greasy, sweating man.}
{101}{}{You see Eric.}
{102}{}{You see a greasy, sweating man. He looks quite miserable.}
{103}{}{Like this town needed any more hard luck. Like *I* needed any more.}
{104}{}{Come in already! Close the door behind you! Don't let in the flies!}
{105}{}{Dries? F-f-f!}
{106}{}{All right, all right. No need to shout.}
{107}{}{Are you shouting at me?}
{108}{}{I'll let in all the damn flies I want. Loser.}
{109}{}{Right. So long.}
{110}{}{Close the door! Please! Go away and take those damn flies with you!}
{111}{}{D'okay!}
{112}{}{Sorry. I'm just a little on edge. All these damn flies and no air conditioning. If I just had a little more power I'd be able to shake 'em... but I don't.}
{113}{}{Who are you?}
{114}{}{How do you get the power?}
{115}{}{Why are the flies coming here?}
{116}{}{You could try bathing, you know.}
{117}{}{Tough luck for you, pal. So long.}
{118}{}{Hmm. Too bad. So long.}
{119}{}{There's a power generating station downtown that controls the power to the city. If you could just go there and get permission to give me a little more energy for my air conditioning, I'd be grateful.}
{120}{}{How grateful? Cash or equipment?}
{121}{}{Yeah, I'll do it for you.}
{122}{}{I haven't got time. Maybe later.}
{123}{}{Are you nuts? No way. Maybe you'll get so miserable you die. Do the world a favor.}
{124}{}{They come here because for some odd reason I exude fly nutrients. My body is rich with food for them, and this sweating just makes it worse.}
{125}{}{That's just plain nasty. Why not take a bath or something?}
{126}{}{Then I'll be doing you a favor by killing you.}
{127}{}{I see. That's more than I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{128}{}{I've tried that. I've tried everything. The only thing that keeps the flies off me is not to sweat... and when I don't have enough power to keep cool, I can't.}
{129}{}{I see. I have more questions.}
{130}{}{I see. Goodbye.}
{131}{}{Yes?}
{132}{}{I talked to Brian and he said the power rations are so tight that he can't possibly allow you to increase your share.}
{133}{}{Where do the flies come from?}
{134}{}{Have you tried bathing?}
{135}{}{Where's the power generator?}
{136}{}{Who are you?}
{137}{}{It's much nicer in here. Comfy?}
{138}{}{Nothing. Forget it.}
{139}{}{I could scrape a little something together for you if you did it. I can't promise much, but then, it's not too huge a favor, either.}
{140}{}{You've got a deal. Just make sure to have something for me when I get your power for you.}
{141}{}{I'll do it for free. No charge.}
{142}{}{Forget it. I don't want to do it.}
{143}{}{Let me think about it.}
{144}{}{I can't tell you how grateful I am to you. Please let me know as soon as you're done so I can turn up the air conditioning and take a bath.}
{145}{}{Will do. I had some other questions.}
{146}{}{Will do. So long.}
{147}{}{Please don't wait too long for this... I'm getting really sick of all these flies.}
{148}{}{Sure. I had some other questions.}
{149}{}{Sure. I'll let you know.}
{150}{}{Thanks ever so much for your compassion. That's sarcasm, by the way, in case you hadn't noticed. Get the hell out of my house.}
{151}{}{Why not go to hell and die?}
{152}{}{So long, fly boy!}
{153}{}{The power generator's on your left as you come into Broken Hills from the outside world. It's run by a guy named Brian, a lazy son of a bitch who does as little work as possible.}
{154}{}{Sounds like a real piece of work. Thanks. I have more questions.}
{155}{}{I see. Well, that's all for now.}
{156}{}{I'm Eric. I used to run the hotel in town, but I had to sell it because of my fly problem. I also ran the tavern, but had to get out of that, too, for the same reason. Finally, I used to run the generator, but flies kept getting into it.}
{157}{}{That's an awful lot of jobs. I have more questions.}
{158}{}{I see. So long!}
{159}{}{He said that, did he? Well, you tell him that the generator is uranium powered and that the miniscule amount of energy I require would barely register on the generator. And tell him I want my power!}
{160}{}{Will do! Nice speech!}
{161}{}{I'll tell him. I have other questions.}
{162}{}{Sure. Bye.}
{163}{}{You're done with the generator? Thank you so, so much. I can't even begin to describe how grateful I am.}
{164}{}{The common way to express thanks is through gifts of money or equipment.}
{165}{}{Don't, then. I'm fine with your thanks.}
{166}{}{Francis the mutant has a power fist. He keeps betting it in arm-wrestling contests. The problem is being stronger than him. If you're interested, I can give you some pills that should give you the edge over him.}
{167}{}{Sure thing.}
{168}{}{I'd rather have cash, if you have it.}
{169}{}{I don't want a reward.}
{170}{}{These pills are called buffouts. They'll increase your strength, but your mind will suffer for a little bit. Don't take too many or you might get hooked. Good luck with the fist!}
{171}{}{Thanks! So long!}
{172}{}{Do you think you can help me with my fly problem? I'd be very grateful.}
{173}{}{How grateful?}
{174}{}{Sure thing.}
{175}{}{Let me think about it.}
{176}{}{No way in hell.}
{177}{}{Here's all the money I have... $150. Thank you.}
{178}{}{No, thank you. So long.}
{179}{}{Then I'm doubly grateful. Oh... I hear you're looking for a GECK. Try asking around in NCR. It's to the south.}
{180}{}{Thanks! Bye!}
{181}{}{Oh yes. The flies have lessened, the air is cool, and I'm less sweaty. Better deal for everyone all around!}
{182}{}{I'll say. Well, that's all. So long!}
{183}{}{You see a greasy, sweating man. He looks quite comfortable.}
