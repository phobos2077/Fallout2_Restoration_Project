# 0. Look
{100}{}{You see Lara.}

{150}{}{She's the leader of this gang.}

# 1. Start (From Where to go)
{200}{}{The name's Lara; I run this gang. You better not be here to cause trouble or
 you're in for a world of hurt.}
{201}{}{Hi again. Need something?}
{202}{}{Got any work?}
{203}{}{Just looking around.}
{204}{}{I'm looking for a merchant named Vic.}
{205}{}{Aruh.}
{206}{}{Rara.}

# 2. Dumb, bye (From 1, 26)
{220}{}{We don't have any doctors in town and I can't help you.}
{221}{}{Sorry, I still don't understand.}
{222}{}{Ack.}

# 3. Vic (From 1)
{230}{}{The name doesn't ring a bell, but then again I don't keep track of who comes in and out of town. Check with Becky. Everyone ends up going through there. She might know.}
{231}{}{Got any work?}
{232}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

# 4. Looking around (From 1)
{240}{}{If you didn't come to the Den for a specific reason you should probably leave. It's not very safe around here.}
{241}{}{Oh, okay.}
{242}{}{Got any work?}
{243}{}{I can handle myself.}
{244}{}{Okay, thanks.}

# 5. Handle (From 4)
{250}{}{No doubt. Otherwise you probably wouldn't have made it here alive.}
{251}{}{Uh, yes, so I heard. You said that already.}
{252}{}{Got any work?}
{253}{}{Okay, thanks.}

# 6. Got work? (From 1, 3-5)
{260}{}{Well it depends on what you're good at. There is something I'm curious about. If you can find out, I'll pay you a bit.}
{261}{}{As I said, I'm looking for more information on a certain something... or someplace. I'll pay of course.}
{262}{}{Sure what's that?}
{263}{}{Maybe later.}

# 7. Bye, let me know if mind changes (From 6)
{270}{}{Let me know if you change your mind.}
{271}{}{All right.}

# 8. Setting Crates (From 6)
{280}{}{Well, there's a church east of here. Metzger has some people guarding whatever
 is inside. Find out what and I'll pay you $200.}
{281}{}{That was easy. I already know.}
{282}{}{Sure.}
{283}{}{I'll see what I can do.}

# 9. Thanks (From 8)
{290}{}{Thanks. Don't get in a fight... yet. I have a plan.}
{291}{}{No problem.}
{292}{}{I'll be right back.}

# 10. Crates Answered (From 8)
{300}{}{What's that?}
{301}{}{Raw chemical compounds in large crates.}
{302}{}{Big containers holding chemicals of some kind.}
{303}{}{Let me check again.}

# 11. Crates Answered (From 10, 18)
{310}{}{That makes sense actually. Thanks. Here's your money.}
{311}{}{Why is that?}
{312}{}{No problem. Bye.}

# 12. Makes Sense? (From 11)
{320}{}{I've seen caravans from Vault City come in and then some of it gets picked up by caravans from New Reno.}
{321}{}{So? Why does that make sense?}
{322}{}{Oh.}

# 13. Makes Sense, Bye (From 12)
{340}{}{New Reno is the chem capital around here. They have to get the raw materials to make their chems from somewhere, right? It seems like they're getting some, or all of it, from Vault City.}
{341}{}{Where's New Reno?}
{342}{}{Okay, thanks.}

# 14. Located? (From 13)
{350}{}{Not sure exactly. Somewhere to the south I think. I've never been there, I just see their caravans stop by once in a while - once in a long while.}
{351}{}{Oh, okay. Thanks.}

# 15. (From 11-14)
{360}{}{You looking for some more quick and easy cash? $50. Easy money.}
{361}{}{Sure.}
{362}{}{Make it quick.}

# 16. Set Ask (From 15)
{370}{}{I need you to check with Metzger to see if he'd be okay if Tyler and I settled some old matters. He'll understand what I mean.}
{371}{}{Why do you want me to ask?}
{372}{}{If I get a chance.}
{373}{}{Okay.}

# 17. Why PC ask Metzger (From 16)
{380}{}{Because I don't want Tyler to see any of my people going into or out of Metzger's place. I don't want to tip our hand.}
{381}{}{Don't you get it? If Tyler sees me all of a sudden talking to Metzger he might catch wind of something fishy.}
{382}{}{We'll see.}
{383}{}{Okay.}

# 18. On Crate Quest (From WTG)
{390}{}{So did you find out what's in there?}
{391}{}{Raw chemical compounds in large crates.}
{392}{}{Big containers holding chemicals of some kind.}
{393}{}{Not yet.}

# 19. Ask/Permission (From WTG)
{400}{}{So did you talk to him yet? What did he say?}
{401}{}{He said yes. If you win, you can have their job, like before.}
{402}{}{Na.}

# 20. Permission Done (From 19)
{410}{}{Great. I was hoping as much. I hear he's been complaining about them lately. Here's your money.}
{411}{}{I assume there's something else now?}
{412}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

# 21. Wait, need info... (From 20)
{420}{}{I have one more job for you. I'm not sure how you'll do it, but since you were able to get inside maybe they trust you.}
{421}{}{I snuck inside.}
{422}{}{What is it?}

# 22. Snuck (From 21)
{430}{}{I'm sure you can figure something out.}
{431}{}{Okay, what is it?}

# 23. Setting Find (From 20-22)
{440}{}{We can't take them at their present strength. They have extra funding
 and slightly outnumber us. If you can find some kind of weakness we could use
 to balance out the odds or something we can exploit...}
{441}{}{Huh? Find a weakness? How am I supposed to do that?}
{442}{}{How much?}
{443}{}{Consider it done.}

# 24. How Much? (From 23)
{450}{}{We'll give you $150. There's no way we can get close enough to find out by ourselves.}
{451}{}{If I get around to it.}
{452}{}{Okay.}

# 25. Weakness??? (From 23)
{460}{}{I don't know. That's why I'm asking you to help.}
{461}{}{I'll try.}
{462}{}{This is pointless.}

# 26. Find/Weakness report (From WTG)
{470}{}{Did you find anything?}
{471}{}{Yes. They're having a party tonight.}
{472}{}{Not yet. I'll let you know.}
{473}{}{Gra.}
{474}{}{Na.}

# 27. Skeleton crew(From 4)
{480}{}{Excellent! They're sure to leave a skeleton crew. Those should be good
 odds. We'll take out those at the party after we hit the church.}
{481}{}{And my money?}

# 28. Money ? (From WTG & 27)
{490}{}{I don't think so. You'll have to come with us if you want your money. You
 won't have to fight but just to be sure it's not a trap. We'll give you $300 total.}
{491}{}{You ready?}
{492}{}{Okay, let's do it.}
{493}{}{Give me a bit to get ready.}
{494}{}{No way. Keep your money!}

# 29. Wait to fight. (From 28, 30)
{500}{}{Okay, but we've got to act soon so don't take too long or we'll ruin our chance.}
{501}{}{Okay.}

# 30. Coward (From WTG & 28)
{510}{}{You don't have to fight. Easy money.}
{511}{}{Well, have you changed your mind?}
{512}{}{Let's go. I'm ready.}
{513}{}{Okay, I'll be right back.}
{514}{}{No.}
{515}{}{Uk}

# 31. CF: No Show (From WTG)
{520}{}{Because of you we blew our chance.}
{521}{}{Coward!}
{522}{}{You get nothing.}
{523}{}{It was probably a trap anyhow.}
{524}{}{Sorry, you're not reliable.}
{525}{}{I can't trust you.}

# 32. CF: 2 Won (From WTG)
{530}{}{We did it!}
{531}{}{Thank you for your help.}
{532}{}{Special thanks to you!}
{533}{}{I've finally paid Tyler back for what he did to my brother.}
{534}{}{Thank you again.}

# 33. CF: Metzger Dead (From WTG)
{540}{}{Now that Metzger's dead, I don't know what'll happen.}
{541}{}{Maybe we should just pack up.}
{542}{}{Did you hear Metzger died? I don't know what to do now.}
{543}{}{What's going to happen to the Den now? Maybe something better.}
{544}{}{This could actually be for the better.}

# 34. CF: Hostile (From WTG)
{550}{}{Bastard!}
{551}{}{Bitch!}

# 35. CF:  Reward (From WTG)
{560}{}{Thanks. Here's your money and $100 extra.}

# 36. Gang Dead (From WTG)
{570}{}{Did you kill Tyler and his guards? How are we supposed to prove ourselves to Metzger? He'll never hire us now. That was our only chance.}
{571}{}{We don't have any work. Someone killed off Metzger's guards and now he won't talk to us. He thinks we did it. Oh well.}
{572}{}{Sorry.}
{573}{}{Too bad.}
{574}{}{That was me, and you're next.}
{575}{}{Oh. Okay, bye.}
{576}{}{Uhr?}
{577}{}{Ug.}

# 37. Gang Dead Cont. (From 36)
{590}{}{I told you we would go together. Since no one was there to watch the place, it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.}
{591}{}{I told you to find a weakness, not kill them! Since no one was there to watch the place, it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.}
{592}{}{Damn it! I told you to ask Metzger, not to kill them! Since no one was there to watch the place, it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.}
{593}{}{Damn it! I told you not to attack them! Since no one was there to watch the place, it got ransacked and now Metzger's madder than hell.}
{594}{}{Oh, well, I've got to go.}
{595}{}{That's a shame.}
{596}{}{You're next, bitch.}
{597}{}{Hmph!}
{598}{}{You next.}

# 38. CF: Next times Gang Dead (From WTG)
{610}{}{You really know how to screw things up, don't you?}
{611}{}{We don't need any more of your help.}
{612}{}{Go bother someone else.}
{613}{}{Metzger better not take anything out on us.}
{614}{}{I'm sorry. I can't help you.}
{615}{}{Can't talk. I'm trying to figure out what to do now.}
{616}{}{I hope Metzger doesn't think we were involved.}
{617}{}{What are we going to do now?}
{618}{}{We better leave soon in case Metzger thinks we killed his guards.}
{619}{}{You ever been to New Reno? Maybe we'll head there - or north.}

# 39. Running to Fight
{650}{}{Alright! Let's go! Everyone follow me!}
