{101}{}{You see a dusty, yellowish-buff colored, dog.}

{110}{}{Grrrrrr. Woof! Woof! Grrrrrr….}
{111}{}{Woof, Arf, Arf?}
{112}{}{(Staring into dog’s eyes) Grrrr! Arrrrrgh! Grrrrrrrr!}
{113}{}{Hmm, I bet you sound angry because you want something.}
{114}{}{You’re just hungry, aren’t you, boy? Let me see if I have some delicious drymeat to
 give you.}

{120}{}{Woof! (Dog leaps forward with teeth bared -— snatches jerky from your outstretched hand -— eats
 jerky noisily)}
{121}{}{Woof! (The mongrel happily grabs the yummy drymeat, dropping a key that he must have had in his
 mouth -— you pick up the key)}
{122}{}{Mmm, jerky}
{123}{}{Ah, poor boy, you must have been hungry. (Patting dog on head)}

 Let’s see if I have some. }
