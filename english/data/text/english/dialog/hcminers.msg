{100}{}{You see a mutant in dusty clothes holding a pickaxe.}
{101}{}{You see a mutant miner.}
{102}{}{You see a mutant in dusty clothes holding a pickaxe. From the calluses on his hands and the
 tired expression, you figure out this mutant must be a miner. He looks tired, and a little confused.}

{103}{}{Whaddya want?}
{104}{}{Ag-ag! Ooo!}
{105}{}{Ork! Ooky!}
{106}{}{Dallo?}
{107}{}{Dallo!}
{108}{}{What’s there to do around here?}
{109}{}{Who are you?}

{110}{}{Oh, good. An idiot. Touched by the radiation, eh, pal? I can’t understand you. I can’t help you.}

{111}{}{I said I can’t help you! Go away and pester someone else!}

{112}{}{What’s there to do? Well, the mine’s shut down because we haven’t got an air purifier that
 works. There’s the saloon. There’s the caravaneers, and there’s the general store.  That’s about it.
 Wait… what were we talking about?}
{113}{}{Who do I talk to about the mine?}
{114}{}{Where’s the saloon?}
{115}{}{Where are the caravaneers?}
{116}{}{Where’s the general store?}
{117}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{118}{}{Just one of the miners.  Do you want someone important?}
{119}{}{Yes.}
{120}{}{No.}
{121}{}{Bye.}

{122}{}{The movers and shakers of the town are Marcus, who’s kind of the mayor and sheriff, Zaius, who’s
 the mine foreman, and Chad, who runs the caravan. Phil the bartender’s the leader of the ghouls, I guess…
 if you can say they have a leader. Who were you again?}
{123}{}{Where can I find Marcus?}
{124}{}{Where can I find Zaius?}
{125}{}{Where can I find Cameron?}
{126}{}{Where can I find Chad?}
{127}{}{Where can I find Phil?}
{128}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{129}{}{If you think you can help out at the mine, go talk to Zaius. He’s usually in the foreman’s hut
 outside the mine. He’s in a bad mood because of the air purifier being shut down. Anything else?}

{130}{}{Phil the ghoul runs the saloon. He’s kinda the spokesman for the ghouls in town. You can find
 it to the east of the bank. Anything else?}

{131}{}{Chad runs the caravans out of his place on the southwest edge of town. Anything else?}

{132}{}{Liz, who’s a decent sort for a human, runs the general store just west of the bank. Anything else?}

{133}{}{All right, then. See you later.}
{134}{}{Cameron’s the leader of the normal humans here. He doesn’t much like mutants or ghouls, but he
 treats us okay. He’s a politician, so you’ll usually find him at the bank or the saloon. Sometimes you
 can even find him working at the blacksmith. Anything else? And where am I, anyway? Oh yeah… so… anything
 else?}

{135}{}{Marcus is our leader. He helped found Broken Hills. You can usually find him at the Bank or
 the jail. Anything else?}

{136}{}{Greedy bastard. Do you know how hard we work? I hope you rot.}

{137}{}{Thanks for the ore!}

{138}{}{I can’t believe the mine blew up. We’re all going to starve to death now. That mine was the
 only thing keeping this town going. Well, at least I can go senile without any more work…}

{139}{}{You bastard! Die!}

{140}{}{Thanks for fixing the mine for us. We really owe you for this. What can I do for you?}
{141}{}{Who are you?}
{142}{}{What’s there to do in this town?}
{143}{}{Nothing.}

{144}{}{We owe you for saving us from those NCR bastards. Thanks, pal. What can I do for you?}
{145}{}{Who are you?}
{146}{}{What’s there to do in this town?}
{147}{}{Nothing.}
