{101}{}{It's the guy they call Saltbeef Bob}
{102}{}{He's got about three teeth and a face criss-crossed with the little veins of a drunkard. He smells bad too.}

Did I ever tell you about the time I made my big strike?}
{121}{}{No?}
{122}{}{Hey, quit drinking all my booze!}
{123}{}{Rahhhg!}
{124}{}{It was back in '78 and me and Bessie - best 'bot a man ever had - we was u-ra-ni-um prospecting west o' here. We hadn't turned up a rad's worth o' beans when all of a sudden five - no, I'm sure it was ten - deathclaws jumped us.}
{125}{}{They fought like hellcats. I fired so much I melted down my rifle barrel and was going at 'em knife to claw when old Bessie finally fused her last circuit board. Well, I tried to save her, but it warn't no use. Finally had to cut and run, keeping 'em off with rocks all the way.}
{126}{}{Well, things looked bad when I stumbled into this cave. Thought I was a goner fer sure. Figured it was their lair - but I had me my torch so I went inside. Hoo-wee, it was a deep cave. And that's when I saw it.}
{127}{}{It was a great big door, like them kinds you see in the old video flics. Big and made o' steel. An on it was carved a great, big 13!}
{128}{}{I knew I'd found it, the mother lode, the Vault 13. I sat right down and made me a map. Damn near died getting out o' there, past them deathclaws and then the sun o' the desert and no water.}
{129}{}{By the time I staggered into Shady Sands, I was mostly dead. Took me to the doc and fixed me up, but that doc stole my map. I knows it and that's all I gots to say.}
# took this out -- Got anymore o' that drink, stranger?

{131}{}{Tarnation, it's a good and honest name, is what it is! The boys let me do some cooking around here and if you weren't such a tinhorn you'd know that and know to respect yer elders.}
{132}{}{Sorry, old-timer didn't mean to rile you.}
