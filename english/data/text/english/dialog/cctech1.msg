{100}{}{You see a tech.}
{101}{}{You see an Enclave technician.}
{102}{}{You see someone wearing a lab coat with a pocket protector and lots of pens stuffed in it. He has that slightly confused look of someone new to a job.}

{103}{}{Yes, sir?}
{104}{}{Me new here. Need ask question.}
{105}{}{Me just say hi. Me go now.}
{106}{}{I’m new here. I need to ask a few questions to familiarize myself with the base.}
{107}{}{Sorry to bother you. I’m just saying hi.}

{108}{}{I’m a new recruit myself, sir. I don’t know if I can answer all your questions but I’ll try.}
{109}{}{What can I help you with?}
{110}{}{What this place?}
{111}{}{What you job?}
{112}{}{Where Enclave main base at.}
{113}{}{Me look for vertibird plans. Where I find?}
{117}{}{Me be go now.}
{118}{}{What is this place?}
{119}{}{What is your job here?}
{120}{}{Where is the Enclave main base located?}
{121}{}{I need to look at the vertibird plans. Where are they kept?}
{125}{}{Nothing. I’ve got to go.}

{126}{}{This is the comm center. We handle all communications with the main base from here.}
{127}{}{Me see. Me ask more.}
{128}{}{All right. A couple more questions.}

{129}{}{I’m a comm center technician, second class. I handle all communications with main base and I maintain equipment status.}
{130}{}{Uh... yeah.}
{131}{}{Good. Keep up the good work.}

{132}{}{You’ve got to be kidding, right? }
{133}{}{No kid. Where base?}
{134}{}{Do I look like I’m kidding?}

{135}{}{The main base is located off the Pacific coast near the city of San Francisco. May I ask why you are asking?}
{136}{}{No. Reason military. How many way get to base?}
{137}{}{No. This is a military matter. Now, how many ways do you know of to reach the base?}

{138}{}{Well... there’s the vertibirds, but that’s pretty obvious. Then there’s the tanker down in San Fran. Other than that I guess you’d have to swim.}
{139}{}{Thanks.}
{140}{}{Thanks.}

{141}{}{They would be located in maintenance, next to air traffic control. }
{142}{}{Okay.}
{143}{}{Got it.}

{153}{}{Are you nuts, walking around here out of uniform? Get suited up!}
{154}{}{If the sergeant catches you out of uniform he’ll hand you your ass.}
{155}{}{Why are you out of uniform? }

{156}{}{Holy shit! We’re being invaded! Alert!}
{157}{}{Intruders! Call the guard!}
{158}{}{Guard! Intruders in the comm center!}

{159}{}{What’s up? Are we under attack?}
{160}{}{Why the alert? What’s happening?}
{161}{}{What the hell’s going on?}

{162}{}{I’m just a tech, don’t shoot me!}
{163}{}{I didn’t sign up for combat, just tech training!}
{164}{}{This is a lab coat, not armor! I’m outta here!}
