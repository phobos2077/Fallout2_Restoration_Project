{100}{}{You see Wallace's Assistant, Skeev.}
{101}{}{You see a scrawny young man. His eyes are darting back and forth.}
{102}{}{You see Wallace's Assistant, Skeev.}
{103}{}{You see a scrawny young man. His eyes are darting back and forth.}
{104}{}{Hey, you got any pieces of Horrigan? I could sell 'em for fifty, hundred bucks a pop, give you 10% of the action.}
{105}{}{Get lost.}
{106}{}{Beat it. I got nothing to say to you.}
{107}{}{Oh, uh, hey, Captain. Good day, huh?}
{108}{}{Well, if it ain't the new Citizen.}
{109}{}{Hey there, "Citizen."}
{110}{}{You can't bring that mutant in here.}
{111}{}{You can't bring that ghoul in here.}
{112}{}{We're shut down for the night. Come back in the morning.}
{113}{}{Look, Outsider, if you got customs business, Wallace is in the back there, okay? He'll set you up with all the forms you need.}
{114}{}{Furms need?}
{115}{}{Shamble off}
{116}{}{Uh... what is this place?}
{117}{}{All right. Thanks.}
{118}{}{This is the CUSTOMS Office. Like the sign outside says. If you haven't got customs business, what are you doing here?}
{119}{}{I was looking for the Vault.}
{120}{}{I was looking to get inside the city.}
{121}{}{Since you're a part of customs and all, I was wondering if you had any 'advice' on how to bring certain items within the city.}
{122}{}{Nothing. Sorry to bother you.}
{123}{}{The Vault? It's inside the city. Why? You looking to get past the gate?}
{124}{}{Yes.}
{125}{}{No, just looking around. Thanks.}
{126}{}{Well, you could go see my boss, Wallace, and TRY to get permission to get inside, but you'd be wasting your time. He never lets anybody in. Of course, there's other ways...}
{127}{}{What other ways?}
{128}{}{Thanks. I'll go see Wallace then.}
{129}{}{Advice? Well, advice's expensive, Outsider. You got any money?}
{130}{}{Give him $50.}
{131}{}{Give him $75.}
{132}{}{Give him $100.}
{133}{}{Probably not enough to interest you. I'll be back when I have some more.}
{134}{}{Never mind. Maybe we'll talk later.}
{135}{}{Well, there's a few things you can do. One is become a Citizen. They never search Citizens. Of course, your chances of becoming a Citizen are next to nothing.}
{136}{}{Why?}
{137}{}{What else could I do?}
{138}{}{Nevermind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{139}{}{If you're not born a Citizen, then you have to take a test to become a Citizen. Number of Outsiders that have taken the test and become Citizens? Zero. Your chances? LESS than zero.}
{140}{}{What is this test?}
{141}{}{What else could I do to beat customs?}
{142}{}{Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{143}{}{Gregory, the Proconsul, gives a "test" to any Outsiders who want to become Citizens. It measures their intelligence and
 perception, and you have to be damn lucky to pass it, too. Most Citizens would have trouble with it.}
{144}{}{So what makes it so hard?}
{145}{}{What else could I do to beat customs other than becoming a Citizen?}
{146}{}{Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{147}{}{Since most Outsiders can't read, do trigonometry, or spell "Australopithecus," you figure it out. It's just an excuse to keep Outsiders from becoming Citizens.}
{148}{}{What else could I do to beat customs other than becoming a Citizen?}
{149}{}{Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{150}{}{Hide the goods on your slaves...your "Servants." You see, Vault City mentality is this:
They don't seem to catch on that anyone would let Servants carry anything important... or questionable. Go figure.}
{151}{}{Any other options?}
{152}{}{All right, then. Thanks.}
{153}{}{Well, you CAN become a Citizen... unofficially.}
{154}{}{What are you talking about?}
{155}{}{Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{156}{}{If you got the cash, then I'll go into detail. Otherwise...}
{157}{}{I've got the money. What are you selling?}
{158}{}{Nevermind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{159}{}{$200, and the papers are yours.}
{160}{}{For two hundred bucks, I can make you a full-fledged Citizen. You'll have free passage through
 the gate, no hassles. I can print out the papers, register your serial number, and have you on your way
 in five minutes.}
{161}{}{What if I told somebody that you were peddling Citizenship papers?}
{162}{}{Sounds good. Here's $200.}
{163}{}{Well, two hundred's pretty steep. I only got $150 on me.}
{164}{}{I don't have that kind of cash on me. Maybe some other time.}
{165}{}{No thanks. Maybe some other time.}
{166}{}{Simple. They wouldn't BELIEVE you. You're an Outsider, I'm a Citizen. Guess whose word they're going to believe?}
{167}{}{I'll take the Citizenship papers, then.}
{168}{}{I'll take the Citizenship papers... but for $150, not $200.}
{169}{}{Well, $200's too steep for me. I might be back if I get some more money.}
{170}{}{Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{171}{}{Hmmm. Well, all right... I'm feeling charitable today. But don't tell any of your other Outsider
 friends you got them so cheap.}
{172}{}{All right.}
{173}{}{Just give me the damn papers.}
{174}{}{All right, they're all done printing. Here you are..."Citizen." And don't tell anyone about this,
 ESPECIALLY Wallace, all right?}
{175}{}{No problem. I would never think of doing such a thing to an upstanding Citizen such as
 yourself, especially when I have proof of your illegal activities sitting right here in my pocket.}
{176}{}{Got it. No problem.}
{177}{}{What th-?! Nobody's gonna believe you, Outsider! It'll be your word over mine!}
{178}{}{Normally, it would be. But these fake papers speak for themselves. And they will,
 unless you can pay for their silence.}
{179}{}{Of course it will. See you.}
{180}{}{I... wh... you dirty...}
{181}{}{Careful... I'd watch your tongue if I were you.}
{182}{}{Sweet talking me isn't going to help, Skeev.}
{183}{}{All right, I got a LITTLE cash stashed away. Here. Take it... three hundred bucks.
 Now, you gonna keep quiet?}
{184}{}{As far as you know. See you.}
{185}{}{No problem. You have my silence.}
{186}{}{Two hundred or nothing, Outsider. It's the only way you're going to get inside the gate.}
{187}{}{I think I'll try official channels.}
{188}{}{No thanks.}
{189}{}{Ha! Good luck, Outsider. The only way you'll get a Day Pass outta ol' man Wallace is if you pry
 it from his stingy, dead fingers.}
{190}{}{I'll try him anyway.}
{191}{}{If that's what it takes...}
{192}{}{You reconsider?}
{193}{}{You again. What do you want?}
{194}{}{Vant? Vant!}
{195}{}{Shamble off}
{196}{}{What is this place?}
{197}{}{I'd like to get inside the city.}
{198}{}{I'd like to buy those fake Citizenship papers you were offering before.}
{199}{}{I've decided to turn you in for selling fake Citizenship papers.}
{200}{}{Since you're a part of customs and all, I was wondering if you had any 'advice' on how to bring certain items within the city.}
{201}{}{Never mind.}
{202}{}{Look, dim, get out of here, or I'll call the guards.}
{203}{}{Look, dim, get out of h -- Mmmm. Wait a minute. Maybe...}
{204}{}{Hurnh?}
{205}{}{Shamble off}
{206}{}{Come with me a second, dim. I got somebody you gotta meet.}
{207}{}{Okee-dokeee}
{208}{}{Nuh-uh ME STAY}
{209}{}{Found this Outsider wandering in the wastes, Barkus. Looks like good Servant material.}
{210}{}{Found this bunch wandering in the wastes, Barkus. This one Outsider here looks like good Servant material.}
{211}{}{2 Seconds}
{212}{}{You HAVE to be kidding. It's obviously retarded.}
{213}{}{1 Second, don't remove Barkus' float yet.}
{214}{}{Re-tar-dead! Pooooo!}
{215}{}{2 Seconds}
{216}{}{C'mon. You need someone to work the Vault, don't you?}
{217}{}{1 Second, don't remove Barkus' float yet.}
{218}{}{Valt! Gechkk!}
{219}{}{2 Seconds}
{220}{}{Well...hmmm. I suppose you'll be expecting a finder's fee?}
{221}{}{2 Seconds}
{222}{}{Do Outsiders eat their own feces? Of COURSE I want a finder's fee.}
{223}{}{1 Second, Don't remove Skeev's float}
{224}{}{Feeee? Peeeeeeee!}
{225}{}{1 Second}
{226}{}{Very well. I'll send it off to the Vault then. MAYBE it can clear up the storerooms.}
{227}{}{Whoa. How did you escape?}
{228}{}{Whoa. How did you escape? You better get back inside before Barkus gets mad. C'mon...}
{229}{}{Oh-keeee}
{230}{}{Shamble off}
{231}{}{Like I said before, I can make you a full-fledged Citizen for $200. You'll have free passage
 through the gate, no hassles. I can print out the papers, register your serial number,
 and have you on your way in five minutes.}
{232}{}{What does it take to become a real Citizen?}
{233}{}{And what if I do? I could go tell him right now that you're selling fake Citizenship papers.}
{234}{}{I sure hope so. I can be pretty persuasive.}
{235}{}{We'll see about that.}
{236}{}{Ha! I'd like to see you try. Wallace'll never believe you.}
{237}{}{Oh, I think he will once he sees the fake citizenship papers you gave me. Of course, if you
 happen to have some cash on you, it can be our little secret.}
{238}{}{We'll see about that.}
{239}{}{I'll take the Citizenship papers, then.}
{240}{}{Well, $200's too steep for me. I might be back if I get some more money.}
{241}{}{No, thanks. Maybe some other time.}
{242}{}{What does it take to become a real Citizen?}
{243}{}{Hmmmm. How much for the Citizenship papers again?}
{244}{}{If I have to pry it from his dead fingers, I will.}
{245}{}{How do you become a real Citizen?}
{246}{}{Nothing, never mind.}
{247}{}{No, thanks. Maybe some other time.}
{248}{}{If you're not born a Citizen, then you have to take a test to become a Citizen. Number of
 Outsiders that have taken the test and become Citizens? Zero. Your chances? LESS than zero.}
{249}{}{What is this test?}
{250}{}{I see. How much for those papers again?}
{251}{}{Never mind. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{252}{}{Gregory, the Proconsul, gives a "test" to any Outsiders who want to become Citizens. It
 measures their intelligence and perception, and you have to be damned lucky to pass it, too.
 Most Citizens would have trouble with it.}
{253}{}{So what makes it so hard?}
{254}{}{I see. How much for those pspers again?}
{255}{}{Hmmmm. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
{256}{}{Since most Outsiders can't read, do trigonometry, or spell "Australopithecus," you figure it
 out. It's just an excuse to keep Outsiders from becoming Citizens.}
{257}{}{I see. How much for those papers again?}
{258}{}{Hmmm. Maybe we'll talk some other time.}
