{100}{}{You see a burly female miner.}
{101}{}{You see Blasphemous Bette, a miner for the Morningstar Mine.}
{102}{}{You see a well-muscled woman bristling with confidence.}
{103}{}{Caminetto, your Kokoweef miners are all show and no go.}
{104}{}{I'll show you where to go, Blasphemous Bette.}
{105}{}{You couldn't show me where to go with a roadmap.}
{106}{}{Just 'cause I wouldn't wanna get that close to ya.}
{107}{}{Don't flatter yourself, you little runt.}
{108}{}{You'd be lucky to get a runt instead of that drilling machine you normally use.}
{109}{}{Well, at least my drill lasts more than thirty seconds.}
{110}{}{No wonder the Morningstar's machinery is always breaking down.}
{111}{}{I'll show you broken down, with my fists!}
{112}{}{Your fists? Your breath is bad enough.}
{113}{}{I don't know how you could smell that over your own 3-week stink.}
{114}{}{Stink? Hell, looking at you causes me enough pain.}
{115}{}{You don't know nuthin' about pain, but I'll teach you something.}
{116}{}{You teach me?}
{117}{}{Yeah, that's right. 'Cause your momma sure didn't.}
{118}{}{You talkin' about my momma now? Ain't that creative.}
{119}{}{I'll do a better job of creating a new face for you. That old one sure ain't much to look at.}
{120}{}{You and what army?}
{121}{}{Just me. That's all it's gonna take. But I bet us Morningstars can take you wimpy Kokoweefs
 anytime.}
{122}{}{I don't think so. Kokoweef rules the roost here. I'm gonna have to learn you that.}
{123}{}{Gonna be hard for you to do that when I beat you unconscious.}
{124}{}{Think you might get lucky then, huh?}
{125}{}{I don't need luck to pound you flat.}
{126}{}{You're gonna pound me with your fat? Uh oh, now I *am* scared.}
{127}{}{Put up or shut up, you little shrimp.}
{128}{}{Come get some, you hag.}
{129}{}{Now who's hoping to get lucky?}
{130}{}{That's it, I'm gonna take you out for that one.}
{131}{}{Who the hell is this watching us?}
{132}{}{Someone new. Hey, this is a private matter! Let's get 'em!}
{133}{}{Fer once I agree with you. Get 'em!}
{134}{}{Who's gonna mine the gold now, huh, asshole?}
{135}{}{I could use a fucking vacation.}
{136}{}{I gotta share this crappy jail with that jerk?}
{137}{}{Caminetto, your fucking days are numbered.}
{138}{}{Kiss your ass goodbye for this.}
{139}{}{Get me the fucking hell out of here!}
{140}{}{Hey, fuckwit, let me out of here!}
{141}{}{Hey, Sheriff; I'll blow you if you let me out.}
{142}{}{Next time I'll settle your fucking hash.}
{143}{}{What the hell are you looking at?}
{144}{}{What do you want, dipshit?}
{145}{}{I'm not going to let you fight each other.}
{146}{}{I was just wondering what's going on here.}
{147}{}{There's a bunch of shit in this bar and me and my Morningstar miners are gonna shovel it out
 into the street. The biggest turd even has a name - Caminetto.}
{148}{}{Why? What started it?}
{149}{}{I see. Well, I can't let you do that. You have to break it up now.}
{150}{}{Just look at their sorry-ass, limp-dicked selves. Who wouldn't want to stomp them flat?}
{151}{}{That's not good enough. I can't let you fight.}
{152}{}{Well, that seems like a problem, all right. I don't blame you. Good luck.}
{153}{}{What the hell are you going to do about it, you goddamn shit-heel?}
{154}{}{I'll kill the first person to throw a punch.}
{155}{}{I'm just going to ask you real nice like. Then I'm going to load up my weapons and wait for some
 target practice.}
{156}{}{The Sheriff asked me to help him out while he's laid up with a bum leg. I've got to keep my
 word to him.}
{157}{}{Yeah? That Marion's kinda cute. Okay, for him I'll give those Kokoweef pansies a rain-check for an
 ass-kicking.}
{158}{}{Thanks. I was hoping you'd see things that way. Goodbye.}
{159}{}{Don't you think you're some kind of shit-hot asphalt cowboy. I don't think I like your fucking
 attitude.}
{160}{}{You don't have to like it. You're going to walk with me to the Jail or I'm gonna drag your
 corpse there. Your choice.}
{161}{}{Oh, I'm sorry. I certainly didn't mean to be rude. I'll be leaving now. Goodbye.}
{162}{}{Yeah? Well, I tell you what. I'll go if you jail that asswipe Caminetto, too.}
{163}{}{You're not in a position to make deals.}
{164}{}{That's not a bad idea. Putting some bars between the two of you should cool things off a bit.
 Come along, you two.}
{165}{}{Are you suffering from a cranial-rectal inversion? If you try anything we'll all jump you just
 for a warmup. Then there's gonna be blood. Think the Sheriff'll like the job you're doin' then?}
{166}{}{No, I guess he wouldn't.}
{167}{}{Doesn't matter to me. It won't be *my* blood that's spilled.}
{168}{}{Well, maybe I could use a fucking rest. I've been working my goddamn ass off lately. (to the
 others) Break it up, gang. I'll be back at work tomorrow.}
{169}{}{Good choice.}
{170}{}{Don't worry; I'm bringing Caminetto along to keep you company. Right, Caminetto?}
{171}{}{You just don't fucking get it, do you? You try to mix it up with us and both me and that
 weasel-dick Caminetto are gonna lay into you.}
{172}{}{Then I'll just have to jail both you and Caminetto.}
{173}{}{Then I'll just have to kill both you and Caminetto.}
{174}{}{Hmm, I think I'm needed in another part of town. Right away. Goodbye.}
{175}{}{I guess you're brighter than you look. But then you must be; you're standing erect. Just run on
 home to mommy and say there wasn't anything you had enough guts to do.}
{176}{}{That's it. I've had enough of your mouth. One last chance: Go quietly or I'll tear you apart.}
{177}{}{Maybe I'll do that. I sure don't want to hurt anyone. Goodbye.}
{178}{}{I see how this is going, you little piece of shit. OK, You can take me in, and Caminetto too.
 (to Caminetto) Right, my little fuckface?}
{179}{}{That's more like it.}
{180}{}{Nope. Too late now. I'm gonna have to open up a can of whoop-ass on you two. }
