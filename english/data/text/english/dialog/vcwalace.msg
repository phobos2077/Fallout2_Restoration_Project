{100}{}{You see Wallace.}
{101}{}{You see a thin man with a pinched face. He is wearing a sharply pressed Vault suit.}
{102}{}{You see Wallace, Vault City's Customs Official.}
{103}{}{You see a thin man with a pinched face. He is wearing a sharply pressed Vault suit.}
{104}{}{We have heard about your heroic exploits. By order of the Council, you... and any companions... are permitted to enter Vault City whenever you wish.}
{105}{}{The Customs Office is closed for the evening. Come back in the morning.}
{106}{}{The Customs Office is closed for the evening. I'll be heading home after I tabulate all these lists.}
{107}{}{I have nothing to say to anyone who travels with... ghouls. His kind belong in the Courtyard.}
{108}{}{I have nothing to say to anyone who travels with... mutants. His kind belong in the Courtyard.}
{109}{}{Hello, Captain. Is there anything I can help you with?}
{110}{}{Hello, Citizen. Is there anything I can help you with?}
{111}{}{Hello, traveler. Welcome to Vault City. Is there anything I can help you with?}
{112}{}{Frazz-urb-luuw!}
{113}{}{Shamble off}
{114}{}{Who are you?}
{115}{}{What is this place?}
{116}{}{I believe your assistant, Skeev, is involved in illegal practices.}
{117}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{118}{}{Well, I see I'll have to have to have a talk with the guards in the Courtyard. They seem to be letting just about ANY Outsider into Vault City nowadays. }
{119}{}{Dayz. Daze? Daiseeee.}
{120}{}{Shamble off}
{121}{}{Idiot.}
{122}{}{"Daiseee," you say? How fascinating. Why don't you go back to the Courtyard and tell the rest of your inbred Outsider friends all about it?}
{123}{}{Okee!}
{124}{}{Actually, now that I think about it, maybe you better leave your weapons and armor here. Just for the safety of Vault City.}
{125}{}{Uh-kuh}
{126}{}{Better do the armor first, so y... hey... what's that you're wearing beneath your armor?}
{127}{}{Hnuh?}
{128}{}{Wh--? Why... you're wearing an original vault suit!}
{129}{}{Yup. Valt sut warm. Like mom.}
{130}{}{Yes, I am. And you won't believe what I had to go through to get the DAMN thing --}
{131}{}{Here, take this Day Pass and go speak with our First Citizen - I'm sure she will have many questions for you.}
{132}{}{Uh-kuh.}
{133}{}{Thanks. Uh, I think I'll have some questions for her.}
{134}{}{What do *you* want?}
{135}{}{Citeee? Me go in?}
{136}{}{Hewooo?}
{137}{}{Shamble off}
{138}{}{I'd like to get back into the city.}
{139}{}{I wanted to ask you some questions...}
{140}{}{Never mind.}
{141}{}{Cease bothering me, you fool.}
{142}{}{Me no FUL. YOU FUL.}
{143}{}{Shamble off}
{144}{}{Look, maybe we can work something out...?}
{145}{}{Uh, goodbye, then.}
{146}{}{You were kicked out of Vault City for a reason, Outworlder. No second chances.}
{147}{}{Another one? What happened to the first one?}
{148}{}{ME GO IN. NOW.}
{149}{}{Pwease?}
{150}{}{Shamble off}
{151}{}{Look, it was all a misunderstanding.}
{152}{}{Well, I just don't have it on me. Can't you issue me another one?}
{153}{}{Nevermind then.}
{154}{}{Forget it.}
{155}{}{I can. But there is a $50 fee for every Day Pass I issue past the first.}
{156}{}{All right. Here's the money.}
{157}{}{Never mind. I don't need it that badly.}
{158}{}{Never mind then. I'll come back when I have some more money.}
{159}{}{Here you go. PLEASE try and keep this on you at all times. I don't want to have to keep track of multiple Day Passes for everyone.}
{160}{}{I had some other questions I wanted to ask you.}
{161}{}{Understood. Thanks.}
{162}{}{Name's Wallace. I'm the Customs Officer for Vault City. I accommodate those who wish to conduct business within our great walls.}
{163}{}{I'd like to enter the city.}
{164}{}{"Accommodate?" What do you mean?}
{165}{}{I see. Thanks for the information.}
{166}{}{If you want to enter Vault City, then you'll need a good reason. Only a Vault Citizen has the right to come and go as they please. All others must procure a Day Pass.}
{167}{}{What's a Day Pass?}
{168}{}{It's very important you let me in to speak to your leader.}
{169}{}{Uh, but I am a Citizen. Here, look.}
{170}{}{I see. Thanks for the information.}
{171}{}{This is the Customs Office for Vault City. We're responsible for keeping a log of all the goods that come to us via the caravans and supervising all transactions. All merchants must pass through customs before entering the city.}
{172}{}{I'd like to enter the city.}
{173}{}{What goods do you receive from the caravans?}
{174}{}{I see. Thanks for the information.}
{175}{}{Uh... are you certain?}
{176}{}{Wh-? Who are YOU to be accusing a Vault Citizen of anything?}
{177}{}{Well, he sold me this fake Citizenship. Here, look.}
{178}{}{Nevermind. I must have been mistaken.}
{179}{}{Those who need to deal directly with the merchants or the First Citizen are given a Day Pass. Only those with Day Passes can enter the city.}
{180}{}{Excellent! You sound like just the person I was looking for. I need to speak with the First Citizen. It's urgent.}
{181}{}{Well, I need to speak to the First Citizen.}
{182}{}{Who's the First Citizen?}
{183}{}{What is it that you do, exactly?}
{184}{}{Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{185}{}{Well, of course. Everyone desires an audience with the First Citizen. Sadly, her time is only for matters of the utmost importance.}
{186}{}{You don't look important enough to warrant her time, I'm afraid.}
{187}{}{That's why it's vital I speak to her. I'll be sure to throw in a good word about how efficiently the Customs Office is being run. But if you can't help me, then...}
{188}{}{The information I possess is really important. Really.}
{189}{}{If I were you, I'd watch that tone of yours. I said I need to see her. Now.}
{190}{}{Nevermind, then.}
{191}{}{Oh, do tell. I'll rush right over to the First Citizen to deliver the news personally.}
{192}{}{Well, I didn't say I couldn't help you, it's just that... well... what is the purpose of your visit?}
{193}{}{Uh... I have information that... could lead to establishing a network of... um, all the existing vaults throughout the country. That's it.}
{194}{}{I can't tell it to you personally, Officer, as much as I'd like to. It's for the First Citizen's ears alone. That's why it's vital I speak to her.}
{195}{}{Well... it's... uh, just really, really important. Did I mention how important it was?}
{196}{}{A... network of Vaults?}
{197}{}{Hmmmm. Well... hmmmm. This is MOST irregular...}
{198}{}{Yes. A network... of, uh, Vaults. You see, um, not many know this... but Vault City wasn't the only Vault to survive. There are others. A network, so to speak.}
{199}{}{I wouldn't trouble you if it wasn't a matter of extreme urgency, Officer. I'll be sure to mention how helpful you were when I speak to the First Citizen.}
{200}{}{Nevermind. I had some other questions I wanted to ask you...}
{201}{}{Forget it. I'll come back some other time.}
{202}{}{Well... this certainly seems to be a matter for the First Citizen. Here is your Day Pass. It is only good during the day - at night you will be asked to leave the city. Citizens also reserve the right to cancel the Day Pass privileges at any time, so behave yourself.}
{203}{}{Understood. Can I ask you some other questions?}
{204}{}{Thanks.}
{205}{}{Don't waste any more of my time, Outsider. Leave.}
{206}{}{I suggest you leave now, or I will summon the guards.}
{207}{}{NO Uuu LEAVE or me HIT U}
{208}{}{Shamble off}
{209}{}{I'm not going anywhere. You want to try and move me, go ahead.}
{210}{}{All right, all right.}
{211}{}{And where, may I ask, did you come by this fraudulent Citizenship? These serial numbers are the same as the Citizenship papers stolen last month.}
{212}{}{If I tell you, will you give me a Day Pass?}
{213}{}{It was your assistant, Skeev. He sold it to me.}
{214}{}{I don't know what you're talking about. I am a citizen.}
{215}{}{Hmmmm... very well. If you tell me, I will give you a Day Pass. Now where did you get these papers?}
{216}{}{It was your assistant, Skeev. He sold it to me.}
{217}{}{I changed my mind. I'm not telling you anything.}
{218}{}{You Outsider degenerate. I'm not one to be trifled with! You'll never set foot into our city now! Leave before I summon the guards!}
{219}{}{Go ahead, call them over. I'll deal with them after I'm done butchering you.}
{220}{}{I'm leaving. For now.}
{221}{}{Skeev? This is how I'm repaid for taking him in as my son! He shall be dealt with, I assure you.}
{222}{}{For my troubles, could I get a Day Pass?}
{223}{}{Of course. Can I ask you some questions?}
{224}{}{No problem. Goodbye.}
{225}{}{Skeev? That ungrateful wretch! This shall be dealt with immediately!}
{226}{}{No problem. Can I ask you some questions?}
{227}{}{Ooooooh, I'm scared. Thanks for the Day Pass, pal.}
{228}{}{Understood. Thanks.}
{229}{}{Very well, you've earned it. Here you go. The pass is only good during the day; at night, you will be asked to leave the city. Citizens also reserve the right to cancel Day Pass privileges at any time, so behave yourself.}
{230}{}{Got it. Say, Can I ask you some questions?}
{231}{}{Understood. Thanks.}
{232}{}{Sorry. Unless you have a pressing reason I cannot help you.}
{233}{}{Uh... but I do have a pressing reason. Really.}
{234}{}{Well then, I had some other questions for you...}
{235}{}{But I'm the descendant of the original Vault Dweller!}
{236}{}{Nevermind then. Goodbye.}
{237}{}{Why, how SILLY of me. I should have known that someone of YOUR superior breeding came from Vault Dweller stock. Pah! Waste no more of my time, Outsider.}
{238}{}{You'll let me in, and you'll let me in now, or the next thing that gets wasted around here is you.}
{239}{}{All right, I'm leaving.}
{240}{}{Very well. What did you want to know?}
{241}{}{Hello, Captain. Is there anything I can help you with?}
{242}{}{Hello, Citizen. Is there anything I can help you with?}
{243}{}{You again. Was there something else you wanted, or...?}
{244}{}{Of course, Captain. What else did you want to know?}
{245}{}{Of course, Citizen. What else did you want to know?}
{246}{}{What else did you want to know?}
{247}{}{Frazz-urb-luuw!}
{248}{}{Shamble off}
{249}{}{What is this place?}
{250}{}{What kind of shipments do you receive here?}
{251}{}{Your assistant, Skeev, is involved in illegal practices.}
{252}{}{Can I get another Day Pass?}
{253}{}{I've found the cause of Redding's slowed shipments.}
{254}{}{I found the raiders' camp.}
{255}{}{I found the raiders' camp and wiped them out.}
{256}{}{What can you tell me about your leader?}
{257}{}{Nothing today, thanks.}
{258}{}{Nothing more today, thanks.}
{259}{}{Depends on where the caravan is from. We get shipments from many places... Servants from the Den, uranium from Broken Hills, and metal ore from Redding.}
{260}{}{What can you tell me about the Den?}
{261}{}{What can you tell me about Broken Hills?}
{262}{}{What can you tell me about Redding?}
{263}{}{Can I ask you another question?}
{264}{}{I see. Thanks for the information.}
{265}{}{It's a... community to the west of here. We frequently purchase Servants from their traders. It's quite a rough place, from what I've heard.}
{266}{}{I'm sure a... Servant appropriator... such as yourself has a much more thorough knowledge of that place than I.}
{267}{}{A delightful place, really. Killers, thieves... the usual Outsider scum. A place where one such as yourself would feel right at home.}
{268}{}{What can you tell me about Broken Hills?}
{269}{}{What can you tell me about Redding?}
{270}{}{I had some other questions for you...}
{271}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{272}{}{Thought I'd ask anyway. Goodbye.}
{273}{}{*Thanks.* Goodbye.}
{274}{}{Broken Hills is a mining town to the south. As I understand it, mutants mine the uranium, and they ship it here by caravan.}
{275}{}{They seem a bit shifty, but nice enough... well, nice enough for Outsiders, anyway. No offense.}
{276}{}{Out of curiosity, how much do you pay for your uranium?}
{277}{}{What can you tell me about the Den?}
{278}{}{What can you tell me about Redding?}
{279}{}{Uh, yeah... look, I had some other questions for you...}
{280}{}{None taken. Goodbye.}
{281}{}{It's a mining town far to the west. The caravans from there were the most pleasant to deal with, but recently the shipments of ore have slowed considerably. It has us a bit worried... we depend on their ore a great deal.}
{282}{}{I know why the shipments from Redding have slowed.}
{283}{}{What can you tell me about the Den?}
{284}{}{What can you tell me about Broken Hills?}
{285}{}{I see. I had some other questions...}
{286}{}{Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{287}{}{You have? This is excellent news! Please go tell Councilor McClure right away.}
{288}{}{You have? That is excellent news! Let me give you a Day Pass so you can speak with Councilor McClure. The pass is only good during the day; at night you will be asked to leave. Now go.}
{289}{}{Can I ask you another question before I go?}
{290}{}{I'll do that.}
{291}{}{I'll go speak to him at once.}
{292}{}{Funny you should mention that. The price has been going up of late... nothing we can't afford,
 mind you. We're certainly getting a better deal than Gecko. Those filthy scavengers need the uranium
 much more than we do.}
{293}{}{What can you tell me about the Den?}
{294}{}{What can you tell me about Redding?}
{295}{}{I see. I had some other questions...}
{296}{}{Hmmm. Interesting. Thanks for the information.}
{297}{}{Our First Citizen is Joanne Lynette. She has done many good things for our city in her ten years of service.}
{298}{}{Such as?}
{299}{}{She has kept our city untainted by the outside world. Even with NCR pressuring us to join the
 Republic and the raider attacks, she has kept our city strong. Now there are the troubles with Gecko....}
{300}{}{What is the NCR?}
{301}{}{Who are these raiders?}
{302}{}{What is the problem with Gecko?}
{303}{}{Can I ask you some other questions?}
{304}{}{Sorry to hear it. Maybe I can hear more about it some other time.}
{305}{}{NCR is the "New California Republic." They claim they are attempting to unify all of California
 under one Government, but we can see right through their pathetic ruse.}
{306}{}{"Ruse?" Is that some weapon that NCR h--?}
{307}{}{Ruse? Are you sure?}
{308}{}{Even if they were sincere, why would we want to share our resources with the cutthroats
 and thieves that live outside these walls? I think *not.*}
{309}{}{I see. What were you saying about raiders before?}
{310}{}{What troubles is Vault City having with Gecko?}
{311}{}{Can I ask you some other questions?}
{312}{}{That's a little more than I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{313}{}{Recently we have experienced a rash of particularly brutal raider attacks. We have had attacks in
 the past, but nothing like this. I fear these raiders might eventually breach our laser turret defenses.}
{314}{}{You won't have to worry about those raiders anymore. I wiped them out.}
{315}{}{Can you tell me anything else about these raiders?}
{316}{}{Uh, sorry to hear it. What was that you said about the NCR?}
{317}{}{What troubles is Vault City having with Gecko?}
{318}{}{They sound like a real problem. I wish you luck.}
{319}{}{Not much. We can't seem to find where they are striking from. Our Citizen Sergeant Stark
 may know more, but he's in the Corrections Center inside the city.}
{320}{}{If I track down these raiders, will you let me in the City?}
{321}{}{I had some other questions...}
{322}{}{I'll go see what I can find out about these raiders.}
{323}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{324}{}{Certainly. If you can find the raiders base camp, I'll grant you a Day Pass.}
{325}{}{I'll see what I can do. But first, I had some other questions...}
{326}{}{It's a deal. Goodbye.}
{327}{}{You have? That is excellent news! Please go tell the First Citizen right away.}
{328}{}{You have? That is excellent news! Let me give you a Day Pass so you can tell the First Citizen.
 Here you go. The pass is only good during the day; at night you will be asked to leave. Now go.}
{329}{}{Before I leave, can I ask you another question?}
{330}{}{I'll go do that.}
{331}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}
{332}{}{Oh, uh, that's not my place to say. You'd have to speak with the First Citizen about such matters.}
{333}{}{What were you saying about NCR?}
{334}{}{What were you saying about raiders?}
{335}{}{Uh, okay... can I ask you some other questions?}
{336}{}{I see. Well, thanks for the information.}
{337}{}{A GECK? Well, that means nothing to me…and if means nothing to me, it will certainly mean
 nothing to the First Citizen. Now was THAT what you wished to see the First Citizen about or
 was it something else?}
{338}{}{I'm looking for a GECK to save my village.}
{339}{}{Look, let me in now, and I'll let you keep breathing. }
{340}{}{Nevermind. Maybe we'll talk later.}
{341}{}{Thank you for your assistance, Outsider.}
{342}{}{Well, as promised, here is your Day Pass... but you step out of line, I'll have it revoked. You hear me?}
{343}{}{Oh, uh… well, I am a merchant. I had planned on trading with the other merchants in the city. Can I get a Day Pass from you?}
{344}{}{You are a merchant? Really. And what would you happen to be selling? Ore? Some of those filthy wastelander lizard skins? }
{345}{}{(Glances at your companion.) Or are you looking to sell some Servants?}
{346}{}{Yes, I am looking to sell some Servants in the City.}
{347}{}{I'm selling some of those… uh… filthy Gecko pelts.}
{348}{}{Actually, I have some fine Golden Gecko pelts with me. }
{349}{}{I'm selling some gold ore.}
{350}{}{I'm selling some uranium ore.}
{351}{}{I don't have any of those things… yet. Maybe I'll be back.}
{352}{}{Actually, I misspoke. Sorry to bother you.}
{353}{}{Hmmmm. Well, let's see what you have. Once I inspect your stock, I can process the paperwork for your Day Pass. }
{354}{}{All right. Uh, all I have is a sample of my stock here. The rest is in… uh, my caravan. Outside the city. }
{355}{}{Hmmmm. Very well.}
{356}{}{Well, this sample is adequate.}
{357}{}{There IS a Day Pass fee for merchants, five hundred dollars. That includes full daytime trading privileges within
 Vault City walls and is good for up to five years after its issue date.}
{358}{}{All right. I'll take it.}
{359}{}{Hmmm... That's a little steep. I'll pass for now.}
{360}{}{Five hundred's a little more than I can afford right now. Maybe some other time.}
{361}{}{Excellent. Here you go…again, it is only good during the day - at night you will be asked to leave the city. Citizens also reserve the right to cancel the Day Pass privileges at any time, so behave yourself.}
{362}{}{Understood. Can I ask you some other questions?}
{363}{}{Thanks.}
