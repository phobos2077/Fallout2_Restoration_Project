 is no number on the back.}
{101}{}{You see a Vault City Citizen.}
{102}{}{You see a Citizen in a bright blue jumpsuit. It looks like the Vault Dweller's suit, but there
 is no number on the back.}
{103}{}{::claps::}
{104}{}{It's the hero! Look!}
{105}{}{My word! It's the hero, here, in Vault City!}
{106}{}{Good day, Captain.}
{107}{}{Vault City prevails, Captain.}
{108}{}{Good day, Citizen.}
{109}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{110}{}{A mutant! Guards! Guards!}
{111}{}{A ghoul! Guards! Guards!}
{112}{}{How did you get inside the walls?}
{113}{}{Excuse me, do you have a Day Pass? }
{114}{}{Hmmmph. Another Outsider.}
{115}{}{Seems like more and more Outsiders are finding their way inside the walls...}
{116}{}{I certainly hope you have a Day Pass.}
{117}{}{Seems like they're issuing Day Passes to just about *any* Outsider lately...}
{118}{}{I have heard of your brave deeds. You have done a great service for Vault City...and the world.}
{119}{}{Your battle against the Enclave impressed even the First Citizen.}
{120}{}{I heard you traveled as far south as San...Fran...Cisco. Is that true?}
{121}{}{Maybe Vault City *should* welcome Outsiders. }
{122}{}{Was it true? Was the old world government still waging the war?}
{123}{}{You should catalog your travels in the Vault City computer so others may read about them.}
{124}{}{You are welcome to stay as long as you wish, hero.}
{125}{}{You should catalog your heroic exploits against the Enclave into a nice, tidy list.}
{126}{}{*Yawn*...hrmnnn? Yes? What is it?}
{127}{}{It's a little late for visitors. }
{128}{}{MOST Citizens would be asleep at this hour.}
{129}{}{Sleeping? No, not anymore.}
{130}{}{Please... come back in the morning. I have a long day of making lists tomorrow.}
{131}{}{Good day, Captain.}
{132}{}{Vault City prevails, Captain.}
{133}{}{Can I get you a donut, Captain?}
{134}{}{Anything wrong, Captain?}
{135}{}{I hope none of those filthy Outsiders are giving you trouble, Captain.}
{136}{}{Do you have any stories about the outside world, Captain?}
{137}{}{Good day, Citizen.}
{138}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{139}{}{I'm feeling double-plus good. You?}
{140}{}{As a Citizen, it is part of our civic duty to make and maintain lists.}
{141}{}{I spent most of the day making that list for the Proconsul, then checking it. I love making
 lists.}
{142}{}{I work in the List Office. Most of us do. We here at Vault City *love* making lists.}
{143}{}{I spent most of the day today updating that list for the List Office. It was good, honest,
 productive work.}
{144}{}{I heard you actually traveled the outside world. How did you survive among those filthy
 Outsiders?}
{145}{}{Oh! You're the new Citizen. Welcome to Vault City.}
{146}{}{Do you need a place to stay while you're in town?}
{147}{}{The Council has our interests at heart.}
{148}{}{We must take care to keep our beautiful city clean.}
{149}{}{The servants? Oh, we use them for menial tasks.}
{150}{}{That Council meeting yesterday was very productive. We made *lots* of lists. We here at Vault
 City love to make lists.}
{151}{}{Yes?}
{152}{}{Something I can help you with...Outsider?}
{153}{}{I'm sorry, did you say something?}
{154}{}{Me? I'm going about my business. Perhaps you should, too.}
{155}{}{Can I see your Day Pass, please?}
{156}{}{Oh... sorry. I almost mistook you for a servant.}
{157}{}{I really don't have time to chat with an Outsider right now. Please move along.}
{158}{}{Could you keep your distance, please?}
{159}{}{Please stand over there.}
{160}{}{The servants free up our time for more important matters. Mostly list-making.}
{161}{}{The servants? Oh, we use them for menial tasks.}
{162}{}{Yes, I can smell... er, see, that you're an Outsider.}
{163}{}{You're an Outsider? How quaint.}
