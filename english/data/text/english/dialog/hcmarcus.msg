{102}{}{You see a burly old mutant with a weary cast to his face. He still looks vigorous and tough.}

# node 1
{103}{mcs1a}{Well, what the hell. I haven't seen one of those outfits for a long, long time. Takes me back.}
{104}{mcs1b}{What do you want, human?}
{105}{mcs1c}{Something else you wanted?}
{106}{}{Uggie.}
{107}{}{Who are you?}
{108}{}{What's the story with this place?}
{109}{}{Why aren't you mutants attacking me?}
{110}{}{What's the news?}
{111}{}{I have something I wanted to tell you.}
{112}{}{You wanna travel with me?}
{113}{}{Bye.}

{114}{mcs3}{Yeah, I'm a ugly mutant. I also run this place. You got a problem with that?}
{115}{}{Uh!}
{116}{}{Nuh.}

{117}{mcs4}{You wanna fight me?}
{118}{}{Uh!}
{119}{}{Nuh.}

{120}{mcs5}{Take your best shot, human.}

{121}{mcs6a}{Good.}
{122}{mcs6b}{Keep your nose clean and you won't get into trouble.}
{123}{}{Uh?}

{124}{mcs7}{I'm Marcus. Helped build the place. Now I'm sheriff.}
{125}{}{You helped build this place? That must have been a long time ago…}
{126}{}{Bullshit. How could you have been around that long?}
{127}{}{Bye.}

{128}{mcs8}{Long story. Want it short or the whole thing?}
{129}{}{Give me the short version.}
{130}{}{Hell, I'm not too busy. Let's hear it all.}
{131}{}{Neither. I have more questions.}
{132}{}{Neither. See ya.}

{133}{mcs9}{Right. Me and a human named Jacob built this place around that old bank about 60 years ago. Anyone's welcome here, long as they keep the peace.}
{134}{}{Great. I have more questions.}
{135}{}{Fair enough. Bye.}

{136}{mcs10}{Right...After the Master and the vats were destroyed, I wandered a bit. No place to go. One day got attacked by this fool wearin' power armor.}
{137}{}{Really?}

{138}{mcs11}{That was Jacob, from the Brotherhood of Steel. He'd sworn some oath to destroy muties. We tussled for a while – probably a day or two. After a while, we just started laughing. What was the point?}
{139}{}{Then what?}

{140}{mcs12}{We became friends. Headed off together. Then other people started following us. Guess they figured if they weren't safe with a mutie and a Steel Knight, safe just wasn't going to happen. }
{141}{}{So you set up here. Why?}

{142}{mcs13}{Uranium mine. I knew there was one around from old maps. Now anybody's welcome here – ‘long as they act right. Others might not think much of us, but nobody's more free than we are. There ya go.}
{143}{}{Wait… you were friends with a guy from the Brotherhood?}
{144}{}{What, you're not killing humans anymore?}
{145}{}{Thanks. There I go. Bye.}

{146}{mcs14}{Oh, what sinkhole are you from? Muties and normals made peace a long time ago.}
{147}{}{I'm from a village founded by the original Vault Dweller.}
{148}{}{From a village to the north west.}
{149}{}{Oh. My mistake. Well, thanks. Bye.}

{150}{mcs15a}{What's news… what's news…}
{151}{mcs15b}{Well, gettin' kind of worried about one of our caravan guys. Chad. He might be skimming. You up to checking him out for me?}
{152}{}{What's in it for me?}
{153}{}{Sure. I'll do it.}
{154}{}{I'm a little busy.}
{155}{}{You have anything else?}

{156}{mcs16}{My undying gratitude. Right?}
{157}{}{Good enough for me.}
{158}{}{No good. I want something.}
{159}{}{How ‘bout more questions while I think it over.}
{160}{}{Let me think about it. Bye.}

{161}{mcs17}{That ain't good enough for you? Then get out.}
{162}{}{Bye.}

{163}{mcs18}{Got a little trouble with the mine. If you're interested in helping fix it, go talk to Zaius, the mine foreman.}
{164}{}{Where can I find him?}
{165}{}{You got anything else?}
{166}{}{I have more questions.}
{167}{}{Maybe later. Bye.}

{168}{mcs19}{Usually at the mine. Sometimes the saloon.}
{169}{}{Got anything else?}
{170}{}{I have more questions.}
{171}{}{Bye.}

{172}{mcs20}{Somebody busted two lunatics out of the jail in the Bank. Find ‘em. Tell me and I'll stuff ‘em back in.}
{173}{}{Got anything else?}
{174}{}{I have more questions.}
{175}{}{Bye.}

{176}{mcs21}{What exactly do you want? Okay. We've got some folks missing. No idea what's happened. Find ‘em, get $500.}
{177}{}{I'll do it for free.}
{178}{}{$500? Sounds good.}
{179}{}{I don't have time.}
{180}{}{I have more questions.}
{181}{}{Bye.}

{182}{mcs22}{Great. Let me know when you've found something, right?}
{183}{}{Sure. I have more questions.}
{184}{}{Will do. Bye.}

{185}{mcs23}{Yeah? What?}
{186}{}{You wanted me to find those missing people. I've found some tunnels below the city. They might be there.}
{187}{}{I've found those missing people. They're in tunnels beneath the city.}
{188}{}{Those two escaped convicts? They're in cahoots with Jacob and Aileen. They're hiding out around Jacob's Drugstore.}
{189}{}{Jacob and Aileen asked me to break two people out of jail. I think they've got a plan how to do it.}
{190}{}{Jacob and Aileen want me to blow up the mine. Thought you might want to know.}
{191}{}{A scientist from NCR wants to try an experimental drug that'll wipe out mutants. Be careful of what you eat and drink.}
{192}{}{Chad took $6000 from the rep in Gecko. The rep was complaining about the price… said it'd been going up.}
{193}{}{Chad kept about $1000 from the last uranium shipment for himself. He's planning on bailing outta town. I got a briefcase of documents to prove it.}
{193001}{}{Chad kept about $1000 from the last uranium shipment for himself. He's planning on bailing outta town. I got a briefcase of documents to prove it.}
{193002}{}{Chad kept about $1000 from the last uranium shipment for himself. He was planning on bailing out of town, but we had a confrontation. He's dead. I have a briefcase of documents to prove his involvement.}
{193003}{}{Chad's admitted to the whole thing. We got into a scuffle over at the caravan center. He's given up and waiting to be brought in.}
{194}{}{Nothing. Forget it.}

{195}{mcs24}{Tunnels under the city? Guess it's not that surprising with the mines around. You'll keep looking around for those folks, right? }
{196}{}{Right.}

{197}{mcs25a}{They're dead? Damn… I'll tell the families myself. }
{198}{mcs25b}{Here's your reward. $500. Thanks for your time.}
{199}{mcs25c}{Oh, hey, I know you said you'd do this for free, but take this as our thanks.}
{200}{}{Sure.}

{201}{mcs26}{Right. Me and my deputies will take it from here...And, thanks. I don't forget things like this.}
{202}{}{No prob. Bye.}

{203}{mcs27}{What is it people got against mutants? We'll be on the lookout. Thanks. The town owes you. And I never forget things like this.}
{204}{}{My pleasure. Bye.}

{205}{mcs28}{Keep your eye on him, will you? I want to catch him red-handed.}
{206}{}{No problem.}

{207}{mcs29}{Well, in that case, we'd better be sure to stop him. Want to come along?}
{208}{}{Sure.}
{209}{}{No, thanks.}

{210}{mcs30}{You want me to come along with you? Ah, what the hell, I'm too old to settle down. We goin' now?}
{211}{}{Yes.}
{212}{}{No, not right now.}

{213}{mcs31}{Ah, there's too much going on right now. When things calm down, then I just might.}
{214}{}{Sure. I got more questions.}
{215}{}{Bye.}

{216}{mcs32}{Damn right. Best friend I ever had.}
{217}{}{Yeah, right, you would've dipped him just like everyone else.}
{218}{}{Bye.}

{219}{mcs33}{Hell, yes, I would've. What a great mutant he would've been.}
{220}{}{I don't think he'd be happy to hear you say that.}
{221}{}{Bye.}

{222}{mcs34}{(laughs) We had this argument all the time. (sighs) I miss that hard-head.}
{223}{}{What about the Master's hatred for humans?}
{224}{}{I still think it's a rotten fate.}
{225}{}{Bye.}

{226}{mcs35}{You're talking a long time ago. The world's moved on. You want to hear ancient history?}
{227}{}{Definitely.}
{228}{}{Not right now. I'd like to ask some other questions, though.}
{229}{}{Not right now. I'll talk to you later.}

{230}{mcs36}{Right. Well, never really HATED humans. We just had a better way. These new governments, they think they've got all the answers. Blah, blah. Been there, seen that, got the scars.}
{231}{}{So what was the better way?}

{232}{mcs37}{The Master wanted to elevate everyone to his level, so we wouldn't fight each other anymore. He was convinced we wouldn't do it by ourselves – couldn't. We had to be forced to evolve.}
{233}{}{Do you agree?}

{234}{mcs38}{While Jacob was alive, I thought the Master was wrong. But it seems that while some men can heed the call and rise above it all, most just run away.}
{235}{}{So you think the Master was right?}

{236}{mcs38a}{Jacob heard the call and embraced it. So did the Vault Dweller. But no matter how many rise above, the masses will always destroy them, right?}
{237}{}{Maybe.}

{238}{mcs39}{The Master just wanted everyone to see clearly. The Vault Dweller ended that dream.}
{239}{}{Sounds like you admired and hated the Vault Dweller at the same time.}
{240}{}{You were a human. How can you justify what the Master did to you?}
{241}{}{So you think the Master's plan was right?}
{242}{}{I'm descended from the original Vault Dweller, you know.}

{243}{mcs40}{You're right. If all humans fought for what they believed in like that, we wouldn't have needed the Master's plan in the first place.}
{244}{}{The Master wanted to enslave humanity!}
{245}{}{Interesting spin. I gotta go.}

{246}{mcs41}{Don't forget, I knew the folks involved. They were the best humanity had to offer. Your people are going to tell the story a different way, right?}
{247}{}{Err… maybe. Umm, I have more questions.}
{248}{}{Wrong!}

{249}{mcs42}{The "original Vault Dweller"? You mean the one who killed the Master and destroyed the vats?}
{250}{}{Ummm… yes.}
{251}{}{Damn right. Gonna do something about it, mutie?}
{252}{}{Nooo… this is someone else. I don't know what you're talking about.}

{253}{mcs43}{Not a problem. Like I said, that was a long time ago.}
{254}{}{I'm not afraid of you.}
{255}{}{Why did you hate humans back then?}

{256}{mcs44}{No reason to be, unless you cross me or someone in my town. Be civilized, that's all I ask.}
{257}{}{I'll keep it in mind. I have more questions.}
{258}{}{I'll keep it in mind. Bye.}

{259}{mcs45}{Lemme make this clear: Nothing's going to happen here unless you start it. Just stay civilized while you're in my town.}
{260}{}{Yeah, right. I have more questions.}
{261}{}{Yeah, right. Bye.}

{262}{mcs46}{My memories of being a human aren't as clear as they once were, but I remember pettiness, hatred, jealousy... I prefer being a mutant.}
{263}{}{So you think the Master's plan was right?}
{264}{}{Huh. You're a lot uglier this way. Bye.}
{265}{}{Then you're fine. Bye.}

{266}{mcs47}{It was flawed. We should have only taken the best. Look around. Most mutants didn't have the mind or will to withstand the strain. (sighs) If only we had chosen better…}
{267}{}{So you would have dipped Jacob? Or the Vault Dweller?}
{268}{}{Yeah, that's a tragedy. Well, see ya later!}

{269}{mcs48}{You ever get back there, tell them the war's over. It's been over a long time.}
{270}{}{Ummm. Okay. I have more questions.}
{271}{}{Sure thing. Bye.}

{272}{mcs49alt}{Thanks for your help. Could've been trouble. We took their weapons cache and disabled their bombs.}
{273}{}{Great! I have some questions...}
