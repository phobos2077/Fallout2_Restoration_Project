{100}{}{You see a balding man in a lab coat.}
{101}{}{You see Tom Murray, the head of the Atomic Energy Commission.}
{102}{}{You see a very nervous old man in a pristine lab coat.}
{103}{}{My machine! My beautiful machine gone. (Sob, sob.)}
{104}{}{We're doomed.}
{105}{}{Without the computer online the reactor will meltdown!}
{106}{}{I can't even swim.}
{107}{}{Maybe I can fix it….}
{108}{}{What's the alarm ringing about?}
{109}{}{What's going on here?}
{110}{}{Don't panic, anyone. DON'T PANIC!!!!!!!!!!!!}
{111}{}{OK, stay calm. }
{112}{}{Maybe this is just a drill.}
{113}{}{Get back to the detention level.}
{114}{}{You really can tell the difference.}
{115}{}{Your forehead is quite beetling.}
{116}{}{Your cranial capacity isn't quite up to snuff is it?}
{117}{}{If you're good, I'll make sure you get a cracker when you get back to your cell.}
{118}{}{You there, you're not supposed to wear that stuff in here.}
{119}{}{I'll wear my armor wherever I want to.}
{120}{}{Oh, sorry, sir. I'll be going then.}
{121}{}{You will, huh? Well, I'll just have to report you then.}
{122}{}{Go ahead. Make my day.}
{123}{}{Oh, please don't do that. I'm leaving now. Goodbye.}
{124}{}{I'm Tom Murray, head of the Atomic Energy Commission. I control our atomic powerplant here. Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?}
{125}{}{What the hell do you want now?}
{126}{}{I need to shut down your atomic reactor.}
{127}{}{I was just curious as to how your reactor works.}
{128}{}{I need to exterminate you.}
{129}{}{Help! Help me! Help!}
{130}{}{Intruders! Alert!}
{131}{}{Run for your lives! The primitives are loose!}
{132}{}{Guards! Heeeeeeelllllp!}
{133}{}{Intruder alert! Intruder alert!}
{134}{}{Shut it down? Are you crazed? You're not going to shut down *my* reactor.}
{135}{}{Yes, I am. You better tell me how, or I'll shut you down, permanently.}
{136}{}{Did I say shut down? I'm sorry, I just wanted to know how your reactor works.}
{137}{}{Oh, it's yours? I'm sorry, I didn't realize that. Well, Goodbye then.}
{138}{}{Here, I tell you what. I'll do it for you. But if you try to shut it down too fast it'll overheat.}
{139}{}{I don't care about that. Just shut down the reactor, or I'll gut you like a fish.}
{140}{}{That sounds dangerous. Well, OK, just forget it. Goodbye.}
{141}{}{You're bluffing. You wouldn't dare.}
{142}{}{Yes, I would. If you don't help me, you're a dead man.}
{143}{}{I tried to let you cooperate, but you wouldn't do it. Oh well, can't let you sound the alarm. }
{144}{}{Hey, I was just kidding. How does your reactor work anyway?}
{145}{}{Yeah, I guess you're right. You better just keep quiet for a while after I'm gone though. Goodbye.}
{146}{}{Okay, okay. I'll do it. Just take it easy now. But I'm telling you - it's going to overheat as soon as I put the containment rods down. If we perform a crash shutdown like this we'll have to scram the whole reactor-or we better learn to speak Chinese.}
{147}{}{Yeah, whatever. Just shut the damn thing down right now!}
{148}{}{That sounds dangerous. Maybe I better look for another way. I sure don't want to hurt anything here. Goodbye.}
{149}{}{I'm not going to risk the lives of everyone here. No way. }
{150}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. I guess I'll have to kill you then. Nothing personal.}
{151}{}{How would that risk everyone's life? How does your reactor work anyway?}
{152}{}{I guess I'll just have to find another way to shut down the power. You better not make any noise after I'm gone. Goodbye.}
{153}{}{You got it. Okay, uh, slide this to green. (He fiddles with a control panel for a few minutes while he mutters to himself.) Okay, you got it, but it sure isn't going to stay stable for very long.}
{154}{}{You did the right thing. Now, I've got to be going. You better just keep quiet in here for a while.}
{155}{}{Good job. Now, I've got to kill you. Sorry, but I can't leave any witnesses.}
{156}{}{I've got to be going. Goodbye.}
{157}{}{I don't control that much of the reactor's operation. The central computer just north of the reactor controls most of the powerplant functions. If that weren't there, we'd have no power at all.}
{158}{}{No power at all?}
{159}{}{Well, not enough for much. The lights, life-support, and defenses would work for a while but forcefields and other power intensive devices would be shut down immediately.}
{160}{}{Sounds as though you'd really be crippled.}
{161}{}{Well, it wouldn't be good. All kinds of watertight security doors close when that happens. No way in the world to open them once they're closed by the power shut-off. That's a safety feature.}
{162}{}{Interesting. There's something else I wanted to know though.}
{163}{}{That's all I need to know. Thanks you've been a big help. You just better keep quiet after I leave.}
{164}{}{Thanks. Too bad you won't live to see that. Goodbye.}
