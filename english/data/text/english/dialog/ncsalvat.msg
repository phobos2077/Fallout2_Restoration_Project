{215}{}{(Salvatore turns to you with a stone-faced expression. He studies you for a fraction
 of a second, then makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{216}{}{Owwww! Turn down sound! Hurt ears! HURT EARS!}
{217}{}{ME CANT TALK OVER RINGING. TURN OFF, WE TALK}
{218}{}{I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!}
{219}{}{I knew I should have gotten permission first…}
{220}{}{Shit!}
{221}{}{Uh, please tell me that was room service.}

# 4. MAIN DIALOGUE INTRO (WTG)
{230}{}{(The elderly man looks up at you. His face is gaunt and covered with liver spots. He is holding
 a breathing mask, which is connected to an oxygen tank by his side.) What… do you want of me?}
{231}{}{Me want…me no know what I want}
{232}{}{Me want}
{233}{}{Me }
{234}{}{Wander off}
{235}{}{I have information for you.}
{236}{}{I have information for you, Mr. Salvatore.}
{237}{}{I'm looking for a job.}
{238}{}{Mr. Salvatore, you have a reputation for strength and fairness. I want to work for you.}
{239}{}{I wanted to know where you get the lightbringers.}
{240}{}{Word is you had Mr. Wright's son poisoned. Why?}
{241}{}{I think I've entered the wrong room. Pardon me.}

# 5. RETARD DEATH WARRANT/TOO MANY QUESTIONS (4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 43)
{250}{}{I have told you the reason the boy was killed. It will not leave this room. (Salvatore
 makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}

 Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{254}{}{I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!}

# 6. INFORMATION (4)
{270}{}{(Takes a deep breath from his mask, then shakes his head.) You have
 nothing…that I need to know, }
{271}{}{Um, I don't recall introducing myself. How do you know my name?}
{272}{}{Uh, okay. Well then, I'm looking for a job.}
{276}{}{Actually, I seem to have entered the wrong room. Pardon me.}

# 7. HOW DO YOU KNOW ME? (6)
{290}{}{(Looks at you silently for a minute. He might be either amused at your question
 or irritated…it's hard to tell.) Again, }
{291}{}{Uh…hmmm. Well, uh, I'm looking for a job.}

# 8. I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB (IMPOLITE) . . . (4, 6, 7)
{305}{}{(Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of…course you
 are. And WHY should I hire you?}
{306}{}{Well, why not? Name a job, I'll do it. I'm hard-working, and I got the skills to
 get things done.}
{307}{}{Whoa. Did I say I was looking for work? I meant to say I was leaving.}

# 9. I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB (POLITE) . . . (4, 6, 7, 10)
{315}{}{(Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of…course. But
 I require a…token of your good faith. A sample of your…willingness to work for me.}
{316}{}{What do you want me to do?}
{317}{}{What would you have me do, Mr. Salvatore?}

# 10. I'M HARDWORKING, WELL-ARMED . . . (8)
{325}{}{(Shakes his head slightly.) Your naiveté has…no place here. Words are not
 sufficient: You wish to work for Louis Salvatore? Then I must know how much I can rely on you.}
{326}{}{Look, you can COUNT on me.}
{327}{}{Let me prove it, Mr. Salvatore. Assign me a task.}

# 11. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO? (9, 10)
{335}{}{(Takes a deep breath from the oxygen mask.) There is…a man…who
 has used his…skill with cards to rob me. The sum is...trivial. The insult is not. I want him killed and
 the money he stole returned.}
{336}{}{Who is this thief?}
{338}{}{How much has he stolen?}
{339}{}{It could be a rough assignment: Can I have one of those laser weapons your family uses?}
{340}{}{Uh, I don't do contract hits. I'll be leaving now.}

# 12. ANY QUESTION FROM ABOVE (11)
{350}{}{Mason will have…the details. (Nods at exit.) Go now.}
{351}{}{All right.}
{352}{}{Thank you, Mr. Salvatore. I will go ask Mason.}

# 13. PUSS-OUT (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 37)
{360}{}{Then you are of…no use to me. Leave now.}
{361}{}{Uh, waitaminute…I changed my mind. I'll do it.}
{362}{}{Leave quietly.}

# 14. CAN I HAVE ONE OF THOSE LASER WEAPONS? (11, 34)
{370}{}{(Narrows his eyes. His next words are delivered in a rasping hiss.)
 ::You have not yet PROVEN yourself.:: Now go see Mason. He will have the…details of your assignment.}
{371}{}{All right, then. Forget the pistols for now.}
{372}{}{I understand, Mr. Salvatore. Forgive my question. I will go see Mason.}
{373}{}{Look: If you aren't going to arm me properly, then I can't continue working for you.}

# 15. MISSION IS ASSIGNED (WTG)
{380}{}{Talk to Mason. He will have the…details of your assignment.}

# 16. LLOYD MISSION ACCOMPLISHED (WTG)
{385}{}{(Salvatore looks up at you, takes a breath from the mask.) Have…you disposed of the thief?}
{386}{}{Naw...Lloyd left town with the money.}
{387}{}{Yep. The vultures are probably shitting pieces of him out right now.}
{388}{}{Not yet.}
{389}{}{No, Mr. Salvatore. Lloyd left town with the money.}
{390}{}{Yes. I made an example of him, Mr. Salvatore.}
{391}{}{Not yet, Mr. Salvatore.}

# 17. LIE (16)
{400}{}{Yet…you told Mason that you had taken care of the assignment.}
{401}{}{Well, yes, but…}

# 18. AND THE MONEY? (16)
{405}{}{(Puts his fingers together.) And…the money. Has it been recovered?}
{406}{}{No, I couldn't find the money.}
{407}{}{No, Lloyd already spent the money.}
{408}{}{Yes.}
{410}{}{No, Mr. Salvatore, I couldn't find the money.}
{411}{}{No, Mr. Salvatore, Lloyd already spent the money.}
{412}{}{Yes, Mr. Salvatore.}

# 19. NO, NO MONEY (18)
{420}{}{Your instructions were to recover the money he stole.
 Have you not done this?}
{421}{}{Well, no, because --}
{422}{}{Uh, I have the money --}
{423}{}{Well, you see, I don't --}

# 20. YES (18, 19)
{430}{}{I will take the money now.}
{431}{}{Well, I don't have it on me…}
{432}{}{Give him 250 chips.}
{433}{}{Give him 500 chips.}
{434}{}{Give him 750 chips.}
{435}{}{Give him 1000 chips.}
{436}{}{Give him 1000 chips. (This is the correct amount.)}
{437}{}{(Make a break for it.)}

# 21. WRONG AMOUNT (20)
{450}{}{This amount…is not the amount that was stolen
 from me. Perhaps you don't know how much was stolen from me. Or perhaps you are holding
 out on me. Either way…}
{451}{}{Oh, well, I must have miscounted…}

# 22. CORRECT AMOUNT (20)
{455}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money, but he holds up his hands halfway
 through the transaction.) The…remaining half is yours.}
{456}{}{Hey, thanks.}
{468}{}{Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.}

# 24. I HAVE ANOTHER JOB FOR YOU (22, 23)
{475}{}{(Mr. Salvatore takes a breath from the mask.) I have another…matter that requires your attention.}
{476}{}{Sure, why not? What's the job -- another kill and fetch assignment?}
{477}{}{I am interested in the job, Mr. Salvatore. What do you want me to do?}
{478}{}{No, I'm done doing hit jobs. I'm making a clean break.}
{479}{}{No more jobs for me, Mr. Salvatore. I have to be going.}

# 25 MISSION TWO: EXTORTION (24)
{485}{}{A constituent in my…district has not paid me…tribute…for the services I provide.
 Collect it. If he objects, inform him you are my…representative in this matter. Talk to
 Mason for the details.}
{487}{}{Yes, Mr. Salvatore. I'll go see him.}
{488}{}{No thanks, I don't do extortion jobs.}

# 26. CAUGHT IN LIE (16)
{495}{}{You are...lying to me. I know that he still lives.}

# 27. TRIBUTE (WTG)
{500}{}{Have you done as I asked?}
{501}{}{Yes, Mr. Salvatore, I have the tribute you asked me to collect.}
{502}{}{Yeah, the 'tribute' is right here.}
{503}{}{Not yet. I haven't got the old guy to cough it up yet.}
{504}{}{Not yet, Mr. Salvatore. When I return, I shall have it with me.}

# 28. NO, NO MONEY (27, 29)
{515}{}{You told Mason you had collected my tribute. Have you not done this?}

# 29. I HAVE THE TRIBUTE (27, 28)
{525}{}{Very well. (He waits.)}
{527}{}{Give him 900 chips.}
{528}{}{Give him 800 chips.}
{529}{}{Actually, I don't have the tribute ON me…}

# 30. WRONG AMOUNT (29)
{540}{}{This amount…is not the amount that was stolen
 from me. Perhaps you don't know how much the required tribute is. Or perhaps you are
 holding out on me. Either way…}

# 31. CORRECT AMOUNT (29)
{545}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done…well. You have
 earned 25% of the cut.}
{546}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done…adequately. You have
 earned 10% of the cut.}

# 32. COLD REFUSAL (22, 23, 31, WTG)
{555}{}{(Takes a breath from his mask.) You have...done as I asked. I have no
 further need of your… services. (Points to the exit.) Leave now.}
{556}{}{Uh…okay.}
{557}{}{Could I have one of those laser pistols as part of my payment before I go?}

# 33. I HAVE ANOTHER JOB FOR YOU (31)
{565}{}{(Takes a deep breath from the mask.) I have another…matter that I could
 use your assistance with.}
{566}{}{Sure, why not? What's the job - more extortion?}
{568}{}{No, I'm done doing extortion jobs. I'm making a clean break.}

# 34. MISSION THREE: GUARD ASSIGNMENT (33)
{575}{}{A…sensitive transaction will be taking place soon. I am in need of an extra… guard
 to insure that the transaction goes smoothly. You will speak with Mason and do as he directs you.}
{576}{}{What is this transaction?}
{577}{}{Where is this transaction taking place?}
{578}{}{Can I have one of those laser weapons you use?}
{579}{}{I can't do this mission right now, Mr. Salvatore. I must be going.}

# 35. WHAT IS THIS TRANSACTION (34)
{585}{}{Mason will have…the details. Go now.}

# 36. CAN I HAVE ONE OF THOSE LASER WEAPONS? (YES) (34)
{595}{}{Yesss. This time, yes. But you will
 carry other armaments as well. Talk to Mason about the details. He will give you
 one of the lightbringers.}
{596}{}{All right, then.}

# 37. MADE MAN? (YES) (WTG)
{605}{}{Sit, }
{607}{}{I would be honored, Mr. Salvatore.}
{608}{}{I can't. I have other obligations. Thanks for the offer, though.}
{610}{}{I would be honored, Mr. Salvatore, but I cannot. I have other duties to another
 family… notably, my mother.}

# 37a. MADE MAN NO
{615}{}{That is... unfortunate. I cannot take the risk that you will remain... silent about
 what you have seen in the desert. Goodbye, }
{616}{}{Whoa! Wait a minute...!}
{617}{}{Oh yeah? Bring it on so I can slaughter your entire family, one by one.}

# 38. MADE MAN? (CHOOSE) (37)
{620}{}{Very well. You must choose a name…}
{621}{}{How about…}

# 39. MADE MAN? (CHOOSE) (38)
{630}{}{(Nods) That is a…good name. Now go speak to Mason. He will have…
something for you.}

# 40. MADE MAN? (AFTER THE FACT) (WTG)
{640}{}{Greetings, }

# 41. SALVATORE_DONE = TRUE (AFTER THE FACT) (WTG)
{645}{}{I have no further need of your services, }

{659}{}{::Stops breathing.::}
{660}{}{Heh-heh. I love killing old people.}

# 43. MR. WRIGHT'S SON POISONED (4, 6, 7)
{675}{}{(Mr. Salvatore looks at you for a long time in silence, then speaks.) We
 Salvatores...we will rule New Reno. If a child must die to insure that, it will
 be...done. There is no other reason.}
{676}{}{What did killing Wright's son have to do with ruling New Reno? That makes no SENSE.}
{677}{}{You murdered someone's SON, Salvatore. You might as well have just signed
 your own death warrant...}
{678}{}{All right then. I just wanted to know why you did it.}

{800}{}{You have assassinated Boss Salvatore.}
{825}{}{You have whacked Boss Salvatore.}
{850}{}{You have resolved the Lloyd "situation".}
{875}{}{You have collected Mr. Salvatore's tribute.}
{900}{}{You have become a made man of the Salvatore family.}
{925}{}{You have successfully completed the secret transaction.}
