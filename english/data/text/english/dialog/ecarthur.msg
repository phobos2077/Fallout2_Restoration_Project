{100}{}{A man in power armor.}
{101}{}{Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon.}
{102}{}{His fly is down.}
{103}{}{Hail, travelers. My name is Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the Brotherhood of Steel. We
 are on quest for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. Hast thou seen it?}
{104}{}{Holy what of who?}
{105}{}{Player Response}
{106}{}{Unga.}
{107}{}{No time to talk. We're on quest.}
{108}{}{We seek the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.}
{109}{}{For the Brotherhood of Steel!}
{110}{}{Hmm...African or European swallow?}
{111}{}{Hey now! That's not yours, is it?}
{112}{}{I'm warning you. Keep your hands to yourself.}
{113}{}{That's it. Enough is enough.}
{114}{}{The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch? Why, 'tis only the greatest hand held, anti-personnel weapon
 of its kind.}
{115}{}{Why do you search for such terrible weapon?}
{116}{}{We of the Brotherhood of Steel seek to find this most devastating weapon of our ancestors, and
 secure it from those who would abuse the power of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.}
{117}{}{Why?}
{118}{}{Well...because the Brotherhood of Steel is dedicated protecting the weak and defenseless, and
 this thing could really hurt someone.}
{119}{}{Why?}
{120}{}{Umm...because it's really the only moral thing to do.}
{121}{}{Why?}
{122}{}{Wha...um...Look now, we're really quite busy. Are you going to help us or not? Have you seen
 the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch or not?}
{123}{}{Yes.}
{124}{}{No.}
{125}{}{Well, why didn't you just say so? If you could just tell us where, we'll be off and you can get
 back to whatever it is you were doing.}
{126}{}{[You point in a random direction.]}
{127}{}{Right then. Thank you for you help. Something for your trouble.}
{128}{}{Wait! I am also on quest. I seek the holy GECK. Have you seen it?}
{129}{}{Well then, no sense in continuing this conversation. We're off.}
{130}{}{[END]}
{131}{}{Bloody peasant!}
{132}{}{[END]}
{133}{}{GECK, you said? Why yes, we have two of them. Don't need another one. Thanks all the same
 though.}
{134}{}{Since you have two of them, maybe you could give me one.}
{135}{}{No. No. Couldn't do that. Wouldn't be right to end your quest that easily. There's some more
 of them that way. Go get your own. [He points in a direction about the same way you pointed when you
 told him where the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch was.]}
{136}{}{[END]}

{200}{}{Do you speak the king's tongue?}
{201}{}{Hellooo.}
{202}{}{Hey, I'm over here.}
{203}{}{If you could spare a moment of your time.}
{204}{}{Ahem.}
{205}{}{Now come on. Don't ignore me.}
{206}{}{Pleeeease! I need to ask you something important.}

{207}{}{Well, we must continue our quest for the Hand Grenade of Antioch. Come, Patsy.}
