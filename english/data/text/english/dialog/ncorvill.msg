{321}{}{What makes you think I'd want tribal trash like you in my family? I got all the hitmen I need.}

{352}{}{I'll take the job.}
{353}{}{No, this job isn't my style. I better be going.}

# 14. FORCED HIM TO TAKE IT? (13)
{360}{}{(Face turns red.) My boys are clean, and they know to stay away from that shit, or I'll kill them. Then SUDDENLY, Richie ODs.
 Someone pumped a ton of Jet in him, so much that fumes was runnin' outta his nose.}
{361}{}{Well…that doesn't mean someone else is responsible. Your son could have taken too much. Jet is highly addictive.}
{362}{}{Hmmm. I'll take the job.}

# 17. LEADS? (15, 16)
{390}{}{(Eyes blaze.) No…everybody's too scared to talk…to a Wright, anyway. If I were you, I would 'question' some of the Reno

{403}{}{Jagged Jimmy J, the dealer on 2nd Street.}
{404}{}{That old geezer, Renesco the Rocketman.}
{405}{}{Lil' Jesus Mordino. He deals Jet.}
{406}{}{Your son didn't die of an overdose. He was poisoned.}

# 19. NAMED A KILLER, EXCEPT KILLER DEAD (18, 47)
{415}{}{That so? Word is, the bastard's ALREADY dead, but I ain't telling you nothing new. I TOLD you not to touch him

 Boys! Get in here!}
{447}{}{Understood.}
{448}{}{I'm not the one for this job, Mr. Wright. Find somebody else.}
{449}{}{Fuck this job, fuck your dead drug-using son, and fuck you. I'm outta here.}

{453}{}{Get out of here.}

# 24. WHAT KIND OF PROPOSITION? (21, 29)
{465}{}{It so happens, not too long ago, I came across a map that shows an old army base in the mountains not far from here. You find a way in there, and I'll see that you're taken care of…}
{466}{}{Okee Dokee Mister Orderville}
{467}{}{ go. }
{468}{}{All right. I'll go check it out.}
{469}{}{Why should I go? Didn't you send somebody already?}
{470}{}{Not interested, thanks. Goodbye.}
# extra 24
{471}{}{I already found a way to get inside the base. There's a lot of old weapons
 and military hardware there, all for the taking.}
{472}{}{I already found a way inside the base. Problem is, there was an... accident...
 the base is contaminated.}

# 25. YOU ALREADY SENT SOMEONE, DIDN'T YOU . . . (24)
{480}{}{(Mr. Wright's expression tightens for a moment, then he snorts.) Heh. Not exactly. The fellas I got the map from are dead.
 They were a tough bunch, but they all got wiped out tryin' to get inside the base.}
{481}{}{They didn't even get INSIDE?}

# 26. YOU ALREADY SENT SOMEONE, DIDN'T YOU . . . (25)
{485}{}{Yeah, the only survivor said…shortly before his unfortunate death…said that there were some kind of super gun turrets
 guarding the entrance. Wiped out most of his boys.}
{486}{}{What happened to the survivor?}
{487}{}{Hmmmm. I'll have to be careful then. I'll take the job.}
{488}{}{Forget this. No one said it would be that dangerous.}

# 27. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ONLY SURVIVOR? (26)
{495}{}{Oh, ol' Sam Pritchard? Sad story. Got drunk one night, mentioned to my boy Keith he'd found this 'base,' and 'fore y'know
 it, he draws me a map and DIES. He's sleeping in Golgotha now.}
{496}{}{Seems like Reno's filled with sad stories these days. I'll take the job.}
{497}{}{Y'know, it's stories like that that make me realize I really can't take this job. Later, Wright.}

# 28. REFUSE (21, 26, 27, 29)
{505}{}{(Shakes his head.) Too bad. You come back and see me if you change your mind.}
{506}{}{I'll do that.}

# 29. CHANGE YER MIND ABOUT THE BASE? (WTG)
{515}{}{(Wright smiles when he sees you.) You change your mind about that proposition I had?}
{516}{}{What was this proposition again?}
{517}{}{No, just stopping by. I'll be going now.}

# 30. AGREE CRACK OPEN BASE (24, 26, 27)
{525}{}{(Nods, smiles.) All right then. Come back when you found a way in, and I'll see you're well rewarded. Now, as for
 the location of the base…head north, then… (Gives you the coordinates for the army base.)}
{526}{}{All right. I'll go check it out. When I find a way inside, I'll be back.}

# 31. YOU FIND THAT ARMY BASE? (X)
{535}{}{Ah, it's you. You got some good news for me? You find a way into that army base?}
{536}{}{If you're back and ain't done what I asked, then you're in for a world of hurt.}
{537}{}{Not yet.}
{538}{}{Yes. I managed to get inside and found a lot of old weapons and military hardware there. It's all there for the taking.
 Now, about my payment…}
{539}{}{I got inside the base, but there was an…accident…the base is contaminated.}
{540}{}{Sorry. I'll return once I get inside the Army base.}
{541}{}{Screw this job, and screw you. I'm outta here.}

# 32. NOT YET. (31)
{550}{}{If you ain't DONE what I asked, then what in HELL are you doing back here?! I need you to crack that base, so don't
 be coming back here until you've done it!}
{551}{}{All right. I'll return once I get inside the Army base.}

# 34. SORRY . . . (WARNING) (31)
{560}{}{If you come back here again and you ain't done what I asked, I'll see you hang in Golgotha, tribal. NO ONE wastes my
 time. You understand me?}
{561}{}{Sorry? SORRY?! That don't cut it this time, tribal. If you think you can waste my time, you're wrong. I can get
 someone else to fill your shoes. (Shouts at door.) Boys! Get in here!}
{562}{}{Understood. I'll be back when I've done the job.}

# 35. MADE MAN (31)
{575}{}{. I like it, I like it. It's got style. Now you stop on by the Cat's Paw and New Reno Arms, and they'll take care of
 you. You need free hootch, head on by the train station, too. I'll set you up.}
{576}{}{Thanks. I'll do that.}

# 37. REWARD/LOSS (SIERRA ARMY BASE) (31)
{580}{}{(Eyes gleam.) You done good, }
{581}{}{An 'accident?' Aw, hell, I don't even want to know. Get outta here and don't ever come back.}
{582}{}{Thanks, Mr. Wright. If I'm a Made Man, then I'd like to be called…}
{583}{}{All right then.}

{584}{}{So what do you want us to call ya?}

# 38. REP: MADE MAN INTRO (WTG)
{590}{}{(Smiles when he sees you.) }
{591}{}{Sure. How are things with you, Mr. Wright?}
{592}{}{Sure. I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.}

# 39. HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU, MR. WRIGHT? (38)
{600}{}{(Chuckles.) Not bad, not bad. My wife is still being a holy terror, but that's nothing new. The joys of marriage.}
{601}{}{I understand. Well, I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.}

# 40. MY WIFE JUST BUSTED UP ONE OF MY CELLS (38)
{610}{}{Angry? Hell, yes, my goddamn wife just went berserk on one of my stills. Don't know how the hell she found out, but…}
{611}{}{Angry? Hell, yes, some low-down sonuvabitch destroyed one of my stills. Don't know how the hell he pulled it off, but…}
{612}{}{Angry? Hell, yes, my customers are dropping off...literally. Something's wrong with the alcohol, and I think it's killing
 people. I wonder if the fermenting process is poisonous...}
{613}{}{She probably just stumbled across it. Dumb luck, no doubt! I don't think anyone told her, nope. Very unlikely.}
{614}{}{Well, those old machines break down all the time! I don't think anyone did it on purpose. Very unlikely.}
{615}{}{Well, it certainly couldn't have anything to do with radscorpion venom leaking into the vats from a severed radscorpion
 tail being dropped in there. I wouldn't dwell on it.}

# 41. MY SON GOT A GUN FROM SOMEWHERE (38)
{620}{}{Funny you should ask. My son got a gun from somewhere…I think it's one of the other families, trying to get him to shoot
 himself or his old man. When I catch the bastard…}
{621}{}{Uh, a gun? Really? You're right, sir, probably one of the other families gave it to him. Be hard to track down whoever
 did it, though. I wouldn't pay it any mind.}

# 42. PROB NOTHING . . . (40, 41)
{625}{}{(Nods.) Probably nothing. Aw, well…}
{626}{}{Sure. Oh, well, I was just stopping by, Mr. Wright. You take care, sir.}

# 43. PUSHERS YOU SUSPECT? . . . (17)
{630}{}{(Frowns.) Way I see it, it was probably a Mordino pusher…that goddamn family controls nearly all the Jet in Reno.
 I'd scope out the Desperado, see what dealers hang out round there.}

# 44. POISONED . . . (18)
{640}{}{Wh -? "Poisoned?" What in hell's name are you talking about?}
{641}{}{I inspected your son's body. Jet didn't kill him...his body still had traces of radscorpion venom in it.}
{642}{}{I found this Jet canister that Richard used… er, was used on Richard. There were traces of radscorpion venom
 in the cartridge.}
{643}{}{I found a Jet canister that Richard used… er, was used on Richard. There were traces of radscorpion venom
 in the cartridge.}
{644}{}{He was poisoned with radscorpion venom. The Jet overdose was just a cover for the poisoning.}

# 45. MY SON'S BODY . . . (44, 52)
{650}{}{"Inspected my son's body?"}
{651}{}{Yeah, I had to open his grave to do an autopsy.}
{652}{}{Uh…you know, I DIDN'T. I misspoke. "Son's body?" I meant "somebody's." Yes, that's what I meant.}
{653}{}{This might not be the best time to discuss this. I'll talk to you later.}

# 46. SON'S BODY, DEAD . . . (45)
{660}{}{You ghoulish son of a bitch…}
{661}{}{You ghoulish bitch…}
{662}{}{ you just earned YOURSELF a plot o' land on Golgotha. IF they find all the pieces. (Starts shouting.) Boys! Get in here!
 And bring yer knives!}
{663}{}{Hold on! Can't we talk about this?}
{664}{}{You're going to need more than knives to take me down…}
{665}{}{Excuse me. The exit and I have an appointment.}

# 47. VENOM FOUND . . . (44)
{670}{}{Assuming I believe this for a second... and I ain't saying I AM... then who POISONED my son? And why did they go to the
 trouble of dosin' him with Jet?}
{671}{}{Word is it was the Salvatores. They pumped him with Jet laced with radscorpion venom, then left him for you to find.}
{672}{}{I don't know which of the Salvatores did it. Renesco doctored up some Jet for them, not knowing they'd use it to
 poison your son.}
{673}{}{I don't know.}

# 48. VENOM FOUND . . . (20, 47)
{680}{}{Now why in hell would they do that?}
{681}{}{Way I see it, the Mordinos control the Jet in Reno. Naturally, you'd blame them for a drug overdose... and then there'd
 be war. IF you two didn't wipe each other out, you'd at least be weakened by the fight. That makes life easier for the
 Salvatores…all they have to worry about then is the Bishops.}
{682}{}{I don't know. Maybe you should ask them.}

# 49. SOLUTION . . . (48)
{690}{}{(Stares at you for a long time, then a dry chuckle escapes his lips.) You give me an answer, and I can't do nothing about
 it. The Salvatores…goddammit. (Takes a deep breath.)}
{691}{}{What's wrong?}
{692}{}{"You can't do anything about it?" What do you mean?}

# 50. PROBLEM . . . (49)
{700}{}{Know what those Salvatore bastards are ARMED with, friend? Those damned lightbringers. ONE Salvatore packing that kind
 of heat can kill my whole family without batting an eye. To beat that, I'd need…}
{701}{}{What?}
{702}{}{Don't worry about it, I've kicked the shins out from underneath the Salvatores already.}

# 51. SALVATORES . . . (50)
{710}{}{Ha! The ones in Reno maybe, but you got a lot to learn about the families... there's still Salvatores kicking
 around beyond Reno, and even if there's just one left, that's trouble. To beat them, I'd need...}

# 52. I DON'T KNOW . . . (47)
{720}{}{(Frown deepens.) This smells like a pile of brahmin shit to me...}
{721}{}{Don't believe me? Look, I inspected your son's body, and it REEKED of radscorpion venom.}
{722}{}{Look, trust me... your son was POISONED. I don't know by who, but somebody went to great pains to make it look like a
 Jet overdose.}

{750}{}{You have solved the murder.}
{775}{}{You fingered a suspect in Richard Wright's death.}
{800}{}{You have correctly identified who killed Richard Wright and the motive.}
{825}{}{You have become a made man of the Wright family.}
