{101}{}{A cop.}
{102}{}{Judging from the unsmiling face, don't expect much mercy here.}
{103}{}{Put your weapon away - NOW!}
{104}{}{Stranger, we got a no weapon policy in this town. Put your weapon away.}
{105}{}{Put the weapon away and nobody'll get hurt.}
{106}{}{It's after curfew, stranger. Why don't you head home?}
{107}{}{Move along now. There's nothing to see here.}
{108}{}{Night's not a good time to be wandering the streets.}
{109}{}{Good day, stranger. New in town?}
{110}{}{Move along now. There's nothing to see here.}
{111}{}{I'm on assignment. If there's trouble you might try reporting it to the sheriff.}

{112}{}{Hey, stop tampering with that.}
{113}{}{Get away from that.}
{114}{}{That is not to be tampered with.}
{115}{}{If you don't stop fooling with that I am authorized to shoot you.}
