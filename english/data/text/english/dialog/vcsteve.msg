{100}{}{You see a cheerful young man.}
{101}{}{You see Steve, Sub-Greeting Chief of Vault City.}
{102}{}{He has a vacant look in his eyes.}
{103}{}{Hello and welcome to Vault City, the best city in New California!
 I'm Steve...how can I help you?}
{104}{}{Is this fenced-in area all there is to the city?}
{105}{}{What do you mean by "the best?"}
{106}{}{I'm looking for the Vault. Can you tell me where it is?}
{107}{}{Goodbye.}
{108}{}{Umm… (Looks at a pamphlet in his hand.) Uh... you weren’t
 supposed to ask that. There’s no answer for that in here.}
{109}{}{Do you know anything?}
{110}{}{Thanks anyway.}
{111}{}{(Reading from the Pamphlet.) If the Outworlder… that must be
 you… insults you… that must be me… then refer them to the Chief
 Greeting Officer. Oh… I'm to refer you to Melinda, the Chief
 Greeting Officer.}
{112}{}{I’ll go talk to her, then.}
{113}{}{Welcome to the Greeting Office. I’m Steve.}
{114}{}{Sorry, gotta read up on this thing.}
