{200}{}{Hello there, I haven’t seen you in Klamath before. I’m Aldo, the town greeter. (hic)
 It’s my job to greet anyone new in town and to answer any questions they might have about
 our bucolic little burg. Welcome to Klamath. (hic) Who might you be?}
{201}{}{Uhh, thanks for the greeting. I’m just a traveler.}
{202}{}{My name’s }
{203}{}{ . Thanks for welcoming me here.}
{204}{}{ of Arroyo. I’m the Chosen One.}
{205}{}{You don’t need to know my name or anything else about me. Go away, you filthy drunkard.}
{206}{}{I don’t think a town like Klamath would have a drunk like you as a greeter, or anything else.}

{300}{}{The Chosen One. Oh mighty }
{301}{}{, you must be very important and powerful among your people. Surely one of your great (hic)
 stature would be happy to follow our custom of tipping the town greeter. (urp)}
{302}{}{Here’s a tip for you - stay away from the booze for a while.}
{303}{}{A tip, huh? Well I guess it’s worth $5 to get you off my back.}
{304}{}{Well, I wouldn’t want to go against custom. Is $5 enough? }
{305}{}{You should give me a tip, just so I won’t take the time to rid Klamath of your filthy hide.}
{306}{}{Sorry, the Chosen One has little use for money -— I have none to give you.}

{350}{}{Well, friend }
{351}{}{, since you’re new to these (hic) parts, and look as though you could use (urp) some pointers,
 I’ll let you know that it’s customary to tip the town greeter before asking any questions and such.}
{355}{}{Sorry, I can’t spare any money for you.}

{400}{}{Well stranger, since you’re (hic) new to these parts, you probably don’t (urp) know that it’s
 (hic) customary to tip the town greeter before asking any questions and such.}

{450}{}{Thanks for the money, friend. (urp) I’m going to use it to get some (hic) medicine for my dry
 throat. Consider yourself officially (hic) greeted to the town of Klamath. Do you have any questions
 about our fair (urp) metropolis?}
{451}{}{No thanks, I think I can figure things out here on my own.}
{452}{}{Well, actually, I was curious about a thing or two.}
{453}{}{Aldo, I’m looking for a trader that sells beforetime things. You know, really old stuff.}

{500}{}{Ask away, oh benefactor of mine.}
{501}{}{What do folks do here in Klamath?}
{502}{}{Where can I trade things or find healing?}
{503}{}{Tell me about geckos.}
{504}{}{Where do you buy your booze?}
{505}{}{Thanks, I think that’s all I need to know for now.}
{506}{}{Do you know where I might find a GECK?}

{550}{}{Thanks for nothing. I hope you don’t stay in town too long. We don’t need your kind here.
 Humph. Tribals -- they’re all the same.}

{600}{}{Here in Klamath some people farm, some raise brahmin, but trapping geckos is what most of the
 people do.}
{601}{}{What’s a gecko?}
{602}{}{Oh, thanks. I guess that’s all I need to know.}
{603}{}{That’s interesting. I have another question, though.}

{650}{}{A gecko is a large lizard that’s hunted by the trappers round these parts for its meat and
 hide. But, it sure is a lot of work to catch them dang critters - and dangerous too. My advice to a
 friend...avoid it. It's far too much work.}
{651}{}{Oh, thanks. I guess that’s all I need to know.}
{652}{}{Hmm. One more thing, Aldo.}

{700}{}{You can buy or trade things at Buckner House and also the Golden Gecko. Sometimes they even
 have healing herbs available -- not that they’d give me any for my (hic) condition. They’re both run
 by real skinflints. Just get a little behind on your (hic) tab and out you go, into the cold and rain.}
{701}{}{Thanks for the information, that’s all I need for now.}
{702}{}{I’ve always found the fresh air invigorating. Hmm, I have another question for you.}

{750}{}{I know that you couldn’t spare any money for the official town greeter earlier, but perhaps
 (hic) this time you are feeling more generous and are ready to be greeted ‘officially’ to Klamath.}
{751}{}{I guess I could spare $5 to keep you off my back.}
{752}{}{I felt that something was missing. Here’s $5; I’m ready to be Greeted.}
{753}{}{No, thanks, I don’t think I need your official greeting.}
{754}{}{I think I’d rather have your insides greet my blade.}

{800}{}{Hey there, friend, good to see you again. Can you spare some money for a bit of medicine? My
 throat is getting dryer and scratchier (hic) all the time. I could even throw in another official
 (urp) greeting.}
{801}{}{Sure, I can always spare $5 for a friend’s medicine.}
{802}{}{Sorry, Aldo I can’t spare any right now.}
{803}{}{I think you’ve had enough medicine. You should sweat that poison out of your system with some
 hard work.}

{810}{}{Thanks for nothing. How can you be so cruel to someone as unwell as myself? Damn tribals!
 (Aldo spits on the ground at your feet, dribbling a bit on his scruffy chin)}

{820}{}{I’m certain that your generosity to someone as needful as myself (hic) will bring you good
 luck. I hope to see you again soon.}
{830}{}{I could sure use some money for medicine. I feel pretty weak - but if you can’t (cough, cough)
 spare any (cough), I guess I understand. Maybe next time, if I’m still around (cough) by then.}

{850}{}{You mean my much needed medicine? (hic) Well, I used to buy it at either the Golden Gecko or
 the Buckner Place (urp), but they won’t sell it to me until I pay some money on my bill. Lucky for
 me, Whiskey Bob's been making a bit of medicine for some of his friends.}
{851}{}{I’m glad you found a source for your medicine. I guess that’s all I need to know for now.}
{852}{}{Interesting. Where would I find this Whiskey Bob?}
{853}{}{Thanks, Aldo. Tell me about something else, though.}

{860}{}{Whiskey Bob is usually (urp) at Buckner’s Place right here in downtown. I don't think he's
 been able to get out to tend his still lately. He's just not a reliable source of medicine for someone
 as (hic) unwell as myself.}
{861}{}{Thanks for the information, Aldo. That’s about all I need to know.}
{862}{}{Glad you found another supplier. Uh, could you breathe a bit more downwind? I’ve got another
 question for you.}

{870}{}{Hello there, Friend -- you look a bit perplexed. What you need is an friend here in town. I’m
 Aldo, the town greeter.}
{871}{}{Friend? Heh, heh, }
{872}{}{ like friend.}
{873}{}{Urk, (sniff, sniff) bad smell. Go away now.}

{880}{}{If you give me $20 I’ll be your friend and I’ll make sure everyone else is, too. That’s how it
 works here in the big city.}
{881}{}{Toowa-eee-nty? Ook?  Beeg Cee-tee? Ook?}
{882}{}{Give man pretty leaf now?}

{890}{}{A Geck? Heck, you mean a gecko. Never heard about a geck but I’ll tell you about geckos.}

{900}{}{Old stuff, huh? (urp) Well the only (hic) trader I know who trades much old stuff is
 (hic) Vic.}
{901}{}{Vic? Where can I find this Vic?}

{910}{}{Well now (hic), I haven’t seen Vic for a while. I don’t rightly (urp) know where he might have
 run off to. You might talk to (urp) Jenny over at the bath house. She and Vic were pretty (hic) thick.
 Heh, heh, heh. Get it? Oh my, I haven’t lost my touch.}
{911}{}{It’s nice to know that no matter how low you sink, you can’t lose something you never had. Let
 me risk asking you something else.}
{912}{}{Thankfully, you’re one-of-a-kind, Aldo. I guess that’s all I need to know.}
