{136}{}{A mutant? Where?}
{137}{}{He's with me.}

{139}{}{He's with you? Then you're coming with us. We're going back to the Courtyard where you... and that thing... belong.}
{140}{}{All right, we'll go peacefully.}
{141}{}{Why don't you try to escort us out of here? I guarantee it'll be an educational experience.}

{153}{}{Hey, congratulations on defeating the Enclave!}
{154}{}{Welcome to Vault City, hero!}
{155}{}{Your battle against the Enclave impressed even the First Citizen.}
{156}{}{I heard you've traveled as far south as San Francisco. Is that true?}
{157}{}{Is it true that the U.S. was still fighting the war?}
{158}{}{You should catalog your travels in the Vault City computer.}
{159}{}{You're welcome to stay in Vault City as long as you want.}
{160}{}{You should catalog your exploits against the Enclave and put it up on the List Server.}
