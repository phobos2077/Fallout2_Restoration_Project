{471}{}{Hmmm. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{472}{}{So, blackmail's Bishop's game? A few raids, a few deaths, and Vault City might be ready to be friends with New Reno.
 Not too subtle, but effective. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{473}{}{That seems an odd tactic...I mean, it's much more likely Vault City would try and get help from someone else before
 caving into Bishop's pressure. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
