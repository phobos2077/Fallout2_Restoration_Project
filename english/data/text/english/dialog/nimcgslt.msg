# JACKPOT! (8)
{310}{}{(As you pull the bent handle, you think you hear the machine give a relieved sigh, followed by a long silence. Just when
 you are about to give up on it, you hear something rattling from deep within the machine. A few seconds later, the rattling grows
 to a deafening roar as coins start piling out in an avalanche!) JACKPOT!}
