{100}{}{He's a  muscular guy, with a barrel chest.}
{101}{}{It's Hal, the captain for the brahmin drive.}
{102}{}{He's chewing a wad of something you hope he don't spit this way, because it stinks to high heaven.}
{103}{}{You here for the drive?}
{104}{}{}
{105}{}{Yes.}
{106}{}{No.}
{107}{}{Need some redding floats!!!}
{108}{}{Yuep need those redding floats!!}
{109}{}{Wonder what Redding floats go here.}
{110}{}{Great. Let's roll out. Head 'em out for Redding boys!}
{111}{}{Well then, leave me alone. I got 500 head of brahmin to get on the trail.}
{112}{}{You again? Go away.}
{113}{}{Well, that was the crapper! Afraid there's no money in this run for any of us. Just be happy you're alive.}
{114}{}{Well, the ranchers are none too happy - it's only a $1000 run. Tough luck.}
{115}{}{Well we had little string of bad luck but did all right. Here's the $2000 you signed on for.}
{116}{}{Hot damn, you were just fine! There's a $1000 bonus in it for you. That and $2000 makes your pay. Redding better watch out tonight!}
{117}{}{You're on your own. Good travelling with you.}
