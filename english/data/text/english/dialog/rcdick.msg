{100}{}{You see a scruffy-looking man with a large beard.}
{101}{}{You see Athabaska Dick.}
{102}{}{This man looks like a miner who would know his way around a pit.}
{103}{}{You're too dumb for mine-work.}
{104}{}{Welcome to the big city.}
{105}{}{Your skylight leaks a little, don't it?}
{106}{}{You're 'bout as smart as bait.}
{107}{}{I've used shovels with more brains 'an you.}
{108}{}{Same old thing, mostly. All of us miners working jist enough to get our next flight on Jet.}
{109}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{110}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{111}{}{I see. Goodbye.}
{112}{}{Well, most of us are workin' our asses off to get enough Jet. Damn price's going up all the
 time now. Hate the way I feel when I'm not flyin' Jet.}
{113}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{114}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{115}{}{I see. Goodbye.}
{116}{}{Cain't hardly work enough to get the Jet I need to feel good. Mebbe' we can work somethin' out
 with New Reno, direct like. I heard that Ascorti might be workin' on that.}
{117}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{118}{}{Asctorti? Who's that?}
{119}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{120}{}{I see. Goodbye.}
{121}{}{I don't feel so good lately, and it seems like I ain't alone, neither. I tried to fly more Jet
 but it shore don't seem to help none. I think it's jist makin' me feel worse than ever. I feel lower'n a snake's belly-jist like most of the miners.}
{122}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{123}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{124}{}{I see. Goodbye.}
{125}{}{I don't know what happened, but most everyone gave up on Jet after that last batch. I felt like
 we were going to fly Jet to that big airport in the sky. Nobody has much interest in takin' it no more.
 Jist the idea makes us sick.}
{126}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{127}{}{Jet? What's Jet?}
{128}{}{I see. Goodbye.}
{129}{}{Howdy. My name's Athabaska Dick. Mostly people just call me Dick. 'Course, there's some what
 calls me Athabaska. Mostly they just call me Dick, though.}
{130}{}{Hey there. What can old Athabaska Dick do you for?}
{131}{}{Got to hurry. Faster, faster! Well? What are you waiting for? If you want to talk to Athabaska
 Dick you need to talk quicker'n that.}
{132}{}{Wha', what do you want? Cain'tcha see I'm busy. (mutters to himself) must stay busy all the
 time…busy…busy….}
{133}{}{(groans) What do you want of old Athabaska Dick? (to himself) I feel like I been kicked in the
 head by a mule.}
{134}{}{I'm feelin' mighty poorly. Whatcha wanna bother ole Dick with?}
{135}{}{Hello, my name's Athabaska Dick. I used to spend all my time taking Jet. But I'm not doing that
 shit anymore.}
{136}{}{I ain't never felt so washed up and raggedy in all my born days.}
{137}{}{Dick, what do you do here?}
{138}{}{Hey Dick…what's going on in town lately?}
{139}{}{Hear any interesting rumors?}
{140}{}{What's At-the-basket mean?}
{141}{}{What's the matter with you?}
{142}{}{What happened to you?}
{143}{}{I work a spell now and then here at the Morningstar. They can always used experienced help.}
{144}{}{Let me ask you something else, then.}
{145}{}{I understand. Well, that's all I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{146}{}{Well, not much lately except about them goll-dang Wanamingos.}
{147}{}{Want-a-mongols? What the heck is that?}
{148}{}{Of course. Let me ask you about something else.}
{149}{}{Well, that's all I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{150}{}{Atha-baska, Athabaska. That's not so dang hard to say, is it? Criminy. That's just my nickname.
 Do you really want to know how I got my nickname?}
{151}{}{Uh, not really. Let me ask you something else.}
{152}{}{I think that's all I need to know. Goodbye.}
{153}{}{Key-rist! I'm sicker 'an a dog and I've been yelling at my feet for days now...ever since I had
 that last hit of Jet. Something must've gone bad with that batch. If'n I survive this, I ain't never
 gonna have Jet again.}
{154}{}{Sounds bad. Let me ask you something else, then.}
{155}{}{I understand. Well, that's all I needed to know. Goodbye.}
{156}{}{I did it. Don't feel real great about it, yet. But I reckon that I'll be better off for it.}
{157}{}{What do you mean? What happened?}
{158}{}{You're tellin' me you ain't never heard of the Wanamingos?}
{159}{}{Uh, well, um. Sure I've heard about the Wanamingos. Let me ask you something else.}
{160}{}{Nope, never heard of anything like that. Tell me about them.}
{161}{}{I've never heard about Wana-whatchamacallits, and I don't have time to waste on your fairytale
 now. Goodbye.}
{162}{}{I kicked the habit - that's what happened. I ain't never having Jet again. That last batch
 nearly killed me. I found I didn't want it so much after that. I ain't wanted none since.}
{163}{}{Well, good for you, I guess. Let me ask you something.}
{164}{}{Interesting. Well, I'll leave you to your recovery. Goodbye.}
{165}{}{Well, some say they were here before the A-bombs, H-bombs, and all-what-else hit. Others say
 they were jean-eti-cally injuneered as weapons. An' then there's some what says that they're from a
 whole differ'nt planet. }
{166}{}{What are *they*? Who cares where they came from, just tell me what *they* are.}
{167}{}{Yeah, sure. I've heard enough, old-timer. Goodbye.}
{168}{}{Well, I don't rightly know what they are 'zactly. But I kin tell you this: they shut down the
 Wanamingo Mine just west of town a few years back.}
{169}{}{The Wanamingo mine?}
{170}{}{That's nice. Well, I better be going, old-timer. Thanks for the story. Goodbye.}
{171}{}{Yup. And the Great Wanamingo was the richest strike in these here parts, too. But now,
 nobody'll go near it. Heck, you could even buy it from Ascorti if you wanted to. But nobody will.}
{172}{}{Like I was saying. The Great Wanamingo used to be the richest mine around, but now you could buy
 it for a song.}
{173}{}{I could buy it? Is it worth anything?}
{174}{}{Who's Ascorti?}
{175}{}{Sounds too dangerous for me. Goodbye.}
{176}{}{Well, not right now it ain't. Haven't you heard anything I've said? It's filled with them damn
 Wanamingos. But if'n someone was to clean the place out - well that'd be a brahmin of a differ'nt
 color. Heck, you wouldn't even have to kill all of 'em.}
{177}{}{What do you mean?}
{178}{}{Brahmin of a different color? Is that like a pink pachyderm? I'm going to leave you and your
 delirium alone now. Goodbye.}
{179}{}{Well, there's some stuff in there that the owners of the Morningstar and the Kokoweef mines here
 in town would sure pay a pretty penny for.}
{180}{}{What kind of stuff?}
{181}{}{Money. Hmm. Well, I've got to be going. Goodbye.}
{182}{}{Well, ya see, mines used to be dug out by big machines. Heck, those machines are built to last.
 Both mines got big diggers. But - an' here's the money question - the dang little control chips weren't
 made so tough. Neither mine's got a chip that works. Heh-hee.}
{183}{}{I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at here.}
{184}{}{The more parts there are, the more there is to break. Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
{185}{}{Well, what I'm saying is that either mine owner would pay for one of these digger-control-chips.
 Heck, if they had a workin' machine and the other mine doesn't, they'd shut the other mine down  - or
 buy 'em out - in no time.}
{186}{}{Too bad nobody knows where to get one of those chips, then.}
{187}{}{I'll have to see how much they'd pay for a chip like that. Thanks. Goodbye.}
{188}{}{Squee-gee out your dang ears! I told you where to look for the damn chip. Ain't you been
 listening to a word I said? The Wanamingo mine had machines, and they were workin' 'til the time the
 mine got shut down. Prolly still chips down there. Jist waitin' fer someone to come along an' take 'em.}
{189}{}{Hmm, maybe so. Let me ask you about something else.}
{190}{}{Tell me about those Want-to-mangles, then.}
{191}{}{Thanks. I'll have to look into that. Goodbye.}
{192}{}{Well you see - here's the god's honest truth - I know someone who saw one up close-like, it was…
(time passes)…With huge fangs that it uses to…(more time passes)…}
{193}{}{I had a friend once that I was workin' a claim with and one day…(time passes)…big as a brahmin
 and it smelled worse…(more time passes)…}
{194}{}{You're jist gonna fall asleep anyhow, but here goes nuthin.' It was late at night, see, and so…
(time passes)…tracks like a cross 'tween a Radscorpion and a Gecko…(more time passes)… See, I told you
 you'd fall asleep.}
{195}{}{Huh, wha? (your head snaps up; you must have been dozing).}
{196}{}{I better go find something to help me stay awake. Goodbye.}
{197}{}{…So, now you know. The slaves that used to work the mine blew up the dynamite stores and
 escaped, rather than face those Wanamingos. Shut down the mine right after and nobody went back.}
{198}{}{Where did you say the Great Wanamingo Mine is?}
{199}{}{Sounds sensible enough. Well, goodbye for now.}
{200}{}{Jist west of town. But I heard that some of the Wanamingos been coming into town late at night.
 So mebbe' you won't have to go out there to see 'em. Heh-hee.}
{201}{}{I think I've heard all I need to about Wanamingos. Let me ask you something else.}
{202}{}{I'll keep an eye out for anyone Wanting-to-mingle. Goodbye.}
{203}{}{Ascorti's the mayor. He runs Ascorti's Ace downtown. He takes care of buying and selling a lot
 of stuff. He's right in the middle of all kinds o' thangs.}
{204}{}{Ascorti's the Mayor of Redding. But I don't rightly know where he is. Haven't seen him around
 for a stretch.}
{205}{}{Let me ask you about something else.}
{206}{}{Oh, okay. Well, go on with the rest of your story, then.}
{207}{}{I think I've listened to you long enough. Goodbye.}
{208}{}{Jet is jist a little somethin' from New Reno. I jist take enough to smooth out the rough edges.}
{209}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{210}{}{Interesting. Thanks and goodbye.}
{211}{}{Jet's the way to go, man. If I'm not flying Jet, I just don't feel right no more. You've gotta
 get yourself some.}
{212}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{213}{}{Interesting. Thanks and goodbye.}
{214}{}{I cain't make it without taking some Jet. Everyone's flyin' it lately. Gotta have it jist to get
 by. Heck, I don't feel so good with it as I feel shitty without it.}
{215}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{216}{}{Interesting. Thanks and goodbye.}
{217}{}{The Jet's bad, man. Everyone who's using got all sick like they're gonna die. I think I better…
(bends over and dry heaves a bit)…sorry. Say pardner, can we talk about something else?}
{218}{}{Sure, sorry. Let me ask you something else.}
{219}{}{Interesting. Thanks and goodbye.}
{220}{}{I don't never want to hear about that god-damn Jet again. That stuff'll kill ya. Damn-sight
 worse'n Radscorp venom. I cain't believe that I ever liked that stuff. That last time… I
 thought I was a goner.}
{221}{}{Let me ask you something else.}
{222}{}{Interesting. Thanks and goodbye.}
