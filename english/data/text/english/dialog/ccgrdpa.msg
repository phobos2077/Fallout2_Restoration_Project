{100}{}{You see a guard.}
{101}{}{You see a guard in power armor.}
{102}{}{You see someone wearing power armor of an unusual design. There is an insignia on the breastplate that you are unfamiliar with.}

{103}{}{Nothing to report.}
{104}{}{Nothing going on with me, how 'bout you?}
{105}{}{Shouldn't you be at your post, soldier? It's not good to wander about here.}

{106}{}{You're out of uniform.}
{107}{}{You better report to the Sarge and get suited up.}
{108}{}{You're taking a big chance being out of uniform. You better report to supply.}

{109}{}{Who the hell are you guys... Alert! Intruders!}
{110}{}{We've been infiltrated! Alert!}
{111}{}{Multiple intruders! Sound the alarm!}

{112}{}{Security alert! Seal the base!}
{113}{}{Secure all stations! We're on alert!}
{114}{}{Intruder alert! Go code red!}

{115}{}{We're going to put you under!}
{116}{}{The Enclave will rule the world!}
{117}{}{You die so that the Enclave will survive!}

{200}{}{...asshole...}
{201}{}{...yeah, you'd BETTER walk away...}
{202}{}{...what a brownie hound...}
{203}{}{...yes, sir! fuckin' sir!...}

{300}{}{Hold on there. What do you think you're doing with that aircraft? There are no scheduled flights for several days.}
{301}{}{Nrg?}
{302}{}{I am aware of this.}
{303}{}{I'm sorry. I was just looking. I'll be going now.}
{304}{}{There's been a change of plans. I'm taking this aircraft.}

{310}{}{What? Oh, I see. Look, don't touch. Okay? Touch again and you die.}
{311}{}{(Smile then attack.)}
{312}{}{(Walk away.)}

{315}{}{Oh shit, looks like we got ourselves an intruder. Code Red! I repeat, code Red!}
{316}{}{That sounds like a good idea. Touch the aircraft again and I'll put a bullet in your head.}

{320}{}{Right. And therefore you are...}
{321}{}{About to leave. Sorry to bother you.}
{322}{}{About to deliver an important message to the main base.}
{323}{}{Oh, really? And what does this message say.}
{324}{}{It's super top secret. I cannot tell you.}
{325}{}{I'll tell you, but it's absolutely essential that you don't disclose this information to anyone else, for fear of a
 mass panic. You see, it's come to my attention that one of the recent shipments of slaves is infected with an unknown, and
 highly deadly, virus strain. I *must* get to the base immediately, or all our lives could be lost. Now stop wasting my time,
 as there isn't a moment to spare.}
{326}{}{Yeah, I believe you. Looks like we got ourselves an intruder...}
{327}{}{Damnit! Ah, whatever. I never get told shit around here. Fine. Be on your way.}
{328}{}{Woah, that sounds bad. You better get moving then, I don't want this shit on my hands. Oh, and don't worry, I won't tell anyone.}
{329}{}{[DONE]}
