{101}{}{It's the captain of the guard.}
{102}{}{She may be a woman, but that shotgun on her hip says she ain't no pushover.}
{103}{}{You'll have to excuse me, I'm a busy woman. No time for chitchat.}
{104}{}{Just keep your nose clean and we'll get along just fine, stranger.}
{105}{}{You got questions? Look up Sheriff Dumont. He'll fill you in.}
{106}{}{Laws are on the bulletin board outside - no weapons, no drunks, no trouble.}
{107}{}{What can I do for you, stranger?}
{108}{}{You again?}
{109}{}{Me go in.}
{110}{}{I'd like to get into NCR.}
{111}{}{Nothing.}
{112}{}{You aren't going anywhere until you stow those weapons.}
{113}{}{Everybody's got to put their weapons away.}
{114}{}{Hmm...well, you look respectable enough. What's your name? I've got to put it in the log book.}
{115}{}{}
{116}{}{Alright then, I'll have the gate open for you in just a second.}
{117}{}{You are not to tamper with that! Please leave now or there will be trouble.}
