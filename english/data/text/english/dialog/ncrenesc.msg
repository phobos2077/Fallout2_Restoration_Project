# 0. QUICK LOOK
{100}{}{You see Renesco the Rocketman.}

# 0. LOOK (GLASSES = DISCOUNT, FREEBIE, DONE)
{150}{}{You see an old man with a pair of huge, garish glasses. He sighs irritatedly as you watch.}

# 0. LOOK (GLASSES = NOTHING)
{200}{}{You see Renesco the Rocketman. As you watch, he takes off his cracked glasses and polishes the one good lens.}
{201}{}{You see Renesco the Rocketman. As you watch, he takes off his cracked glasses and polishes the one good lens.}

# 1. FLOAT DIALOGUES (WTG)
{210}{}{One more lens, that's all I ask.}
{211}{}{Goddamn glasses!}
{212}{}{Damn my eyes!}
{213}{}{You gonna BUY something?}
{214}{}{This ain't a soup kitchen. You gonna BUY something?}
{215}{}{I'm gonna go blind I keep up this line of work.}
{216}{}{Gonna need some more base chemtex nine…}
{217}{}{Demand's picking up…}

# 2. FLOAT DIALOGUES (WTG)
{225}{}{Go to hell.}
{226}{}{Get outta here, or I'll have you shot to death. Twice.}
{227}{}{Get OUT of here.}
{228}{}{Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!}

# 3. INTRO SPIEL (WTG)
{235}{}{(The old man pushes his broken glasses up on his nose and sighs in exasperation.) YES? What is it you want? }
{236}{}{Come on, man, out with it!}
{237}{}{Come on, woman, out with it!}
{238}{}{Okee dokee it coming out…you better stand back (Zip.)}
{239}{}{Okee dokee. Need open bra first. Hold on (Zip.)}
{240}{}{Whut me WANT? Whut you GOT?}
{241}{}{[Stare at him for a second, just to make sure he's real, then wander away]}
{242}{}{Who are you?}
{243}{}{Hey, I have a pair of glasses, if you want them.}
{244}{}{How's the glasses?}
{245}{}{You know, there are decaf brands that taste just as good as the real thing.}
{246}{}{Man, am I in the wrong place. Goodbye.}

# 4.  RETARD (3, 5)
{255}{}{(Stares in shock.)}
{256}{}{…another postnatally-aborted wreck in a post-holocaust world replete with idiot man-children. (Raises his fists.)
 Out of my shop! Get out at once! Don't you come back, you hear?!}
{257}{}{Me sorry little }
{258}{}{Me not know how to put bra back on}
{259}{}{No shout at }
{260}{}{ hate you! }
{261}{}{I'm going, I'm going. For now.}

# 5.  WHO ARE YOU? (3)
{270}{}{Me? Oh, I'm just jolly Saint Nick, you cranially challenged half-wit.}
{271}{}{Me? I'm jolly Saint Nick. And YOU must be that stupid thug-for-hire that's been roaming around town like a
 starved dog hungry for its own excrement.}
{272}{}{Me? I'm jolly ol' Saint Nick. And YOU must be that stupid piece of tailchasing porno trash that's hung like
 a horse and as stupid as one.}
{273}{}{Me? I'm jolly ol' Saint Nick. And YOU must be that stupid slip of porno trash that trench coat-wearing elderly
 men use to fulfill their masturbatory fantasies.}
{274}{}{Well, I'm glad I don't have to introduce myself then. What do you do here, "Nick?"}
{275}{}{Saint Nick? Who the hell is that?}
{276}{}{Look grandpa, one more comment like that, and I'll be wearing your teeth as a necklace.}
{277}{}{Look, I'm going to let your comment slide…this time. Now, who are you?}
{278}{}{Impressive vocabulary…"Nick." You from around here?}
{279}{}{Forget this. I'm out of here.}

# 6. WHO ARE YOU? (3, 5)
{290}{}{(Glares at you, then snorts.) Name's Renesco. Just tell me what it is you want, you…well, whatever it is you are.
 (Squints at you.) You look like one of those sun-worshipping primates under all that get-up.}
{291}{}{I'm from a village to the northwest. Arroyo.}
{292}{}{What do you sell here?}
{293}{}{What do I WANT? I don't really know. Most of the time I ignore my quest and walk into the homes of others,
 riffling through people's shelves...oooh, like those over there!}
{294}{}{You have an interesting vocabulary…Renesco. Are you from around here?}
{295}{}{I'm outta here.}

# 7. WHAT DO YOU SELL? (6, 36, 42)
{305}{}{I sell recreational drugs mostly. That's why they gave me that idiotic appellation, 'the Rocketman.' Hmmmph. I
 also sell some caravan supplies. You NEED anything or can I get back to something important?}
{306}{}{Rocketman, huh? Know the line in that Elton John song, "Rocketman, burning off the mmmncfnfm there at home?' What's
 he really saying there?}
{307}{}{Can I see what you have in stock?}
{308}{}{You sell drugs here in the STORE?}
{309}{}{You mean like selling drugs to Wright's son?}
{310}{}{Go on back to what you were doing.}

# 8. ROCKETMAN/IGNORE QUEST (6, 7, 32, 36)
{320}{}{(Renesco glares at you. It looks like he is undressing you mentally, then tearing you limb from limb.)}
{321}{}{Nevermind, then. I had some other questions…}
{322}{}{Nevermind, then.}

# 9. YOU SELL DRUGS IN THE STORE? (7)
{330}{}{(Renesco looks at you in disgust.) Yes. In the STORE. This isn't the 20th century where drugs are sold by
 street corner cockroaches who live in constant fear of the authorities.}
{331}{}{Well, then -}
{332}{}{But -}
{333}{}{Uh, I think I better -}

# 10. YOU SELL DRUGS IN THE STORE? (9)
{350}{}{This is NEW RENO. There are no cops, no law, and there's plenty of customers who don't mind buying poison at the
 pharmacy down the street. Does THAT answer your question, primate?}
{351}{}{All except one: Was Richard Wright one of your customers?}
{352}{}{All right, all right...what have you got in stock?}
{353}{}{Actually, I had some more questions...}
{354}{}{But, like you said, the drugs are…poisonous. They kill the spirit. Doesn't it bother you to sell them?}
{355}{}{Sure does. I'll be going now.}

# 11. DOES IT BOTHER YOU TO SELL DRUGS IN THE STORE? (10)
{365}{}{Does it BOTHER me to sell them to idiots, slavers, crime lords and tribals that the world would be better off
 without? Primate, three words: get out more.}
{366}{}{OK...can I see what you have in stock?}
{367}{}{All right, all right. Look, I had some other questions...}
{368}{}{The drugs here in New Reno are finding their way to other places, and hurting people there. Doesn't that concern you?}
{369}{}{I'll start by leaving right now.}

# 12. YOU SELL DRUGS IN THE STORE 2? (11)
{375}{}{So? What do I care about them?}
{377}{}{The human race suffered a horrible tragedy. Now we are trying to rebuild. Selling Jet seems…counterproductive
 to that reconstruction.}
{378}{}{Well, whatever. I must be going now.}

# 13. SOME OF THE PEOPLE BEING HARMED ARE . . . (12)
{385}{}{So. What. No one is FORCING those idiots to inhale Jet. No one's going around and jamming it down their
 throats!}
{386}{}{Can I see -}
{387}{}{But don't -}
{388}{}{That is your -}

# 14. SOME OF THE PEOPLE BEING HARMED ARE . . . 2 (13)
{395}{}{Those lamphead rock humpers in Redding KNOW what they're taking, so I don't feel a millimeter of pity for 'em!
 Far as I'm concerned, Jet weeds out the human trash that shoulda died when the bombs dropped!}
{396}{}{Uh, okay. Can I see your stock?}
{397}{}{Where is this Redding you speak of? Why do you mention them?}
{398}{}{You mentioned Redding specifically. Why is Jet so prevalent in Redding?}
{400}{}{That is your right to feel that way. I must be going now.}

# 15. REDDING 1 (14)
{410}{}{Well, Redding's a…special case. See, there's people in Reno who make sure Redding's well-supplied. After all, you
 taste Jet once, you're hooked. It's how I make MY living.}
{411}{}{Speaking of which, can I see your stock?}
{412}{}{Who is making sure Redding is well-supplied? And why?}
{413}{}{So I noticed. Look, I had some other questions...}
{414}{}{I see…I must be going now.}

# 16. WHO'S SUPPLYING REDDING? (15)
{420}{}{Well, tribal, I doubt you have the sense to notice this yet, but New Reno doesn't produce anything useful.
 It's like a big, brightly-lit prairie tick sitting out in the desert. Now, Redding, on the other hand…}
{421}{}{Go on.}
{422}{}{…DOES produce something useful.}
{423}{}{I've heard enough.}

# 17. . . . DOES PRODUCE SOMETHING USEFUL (16)
{430}{}{First and last time I'm gonna warn you, tribal: Don't finish my goddamn sentences. I don't like smartass primates
 that talk when they should listen. No wonder you all still use spears…}
{431}{}{Not all of us. For example, I use a variety of weapons to kill people...let me show you.}
{432}{}{Forgive me. Please go on.}
{433}{}{Burn in hell. I'm outta here. }

# 18. GO ON ABOUT REDDING (16, 17)
{440}{}{Redding has a stable work force that mines raw materials, mostly gold. New Reno sure could use that gold. Somebody
 figures all we gotta do is get those miners addicted, and we got 'em for life. You understand now?}
{441}{}{Yes…except for one thing: Where did Jet come from?}
{442}{}{Who's trying to addict all the miners?}
{443}{}{Yeah, I understand. Look, I had some other questions...}
{444}{}{I don't want to hear anymore. I must be going now.}

# 19. WHERE DID JET COME FROM? (20)
{450}{}{(Points at Myron.) Why don't you ask your little horny toad friend there? I'm sure he'd be happy to tell you. (Glares
 at Myron.) Right, kid?}
{451}{}{We have one person to thank for Jet. You heard of Family Mordino's little golden boy, Myron? Well, the little
 bastard CREATED Jet. Big Jesus Mordino just let everyone know where they could get it.}
{452}{}{Tell me more about Myron.}
{453}{}{Is there any cure for Jet?}
{454}{}{I had some other questions...}

# 20. WHERE DID JET COME FROM? (18)
{460}{}{Big Jesus Mordino's funneling Jet into Redding. Typical power play. Once the pipeline really gets going, those
 miners are goners.}
{461}{}{Where did Jet come from?}
{463}{}{I see. Look, I had some other questions...}

# 21. TALK ABOUT MYRON (19, 24)
{470}{}{Horny as a toad and all the morals of one. Smart kid, though. High IQ. Wasting his brains manufacturing drugs, that's
 for damn certain.}
{471}{}{Where can I find him?}
{472}{}{I see. I had some other questions…}

# 22. WHERE CAN I FIND MYRON? (21)
{480}{}{The Mordinos' got him locked up somewhere. Heavily-guarded, probably. Don't know exactly where.}
{481}{}{Thanks for the information. Can I see what you have in stock?}

# 23. ANY CURE FOR JET? (19, 20)
{490}{}{A CURE for methamphetamine addiction?! Ha! I only know two: one is death. The other is locking yourself
 in a cage for a year without Jet and sweat it out of your system. Hmmmph. "Cure," my ass! What nonsense!}
{492}{}{There must be a cure. What's Jet's chemical composition?}

# 24. JET COMPOSITON? (23)
{505}{}{Why don't you ask your friend there? He designed the drug.}
{506}{}{I just sell the stuff. I'd ask a scientist. Or Myron. He designed the drug.}

# 25. TALK ABOUT VILLAGE (6, 42)
{515}{}{(Renesco glares at you in silence.)}
{516}{}{(Renesco glares at you again, this time in silence.)}
{517}{}{I think you'd like Arroyo. It's a peaceful village. Except for the plants possessed by evil spirits…and of course, the temple
 of trials filled with those deadly spear traps and the man-eating giant ants.}
{518}{}{Hey, you ever heard of a Garden of Eden Creation Kit? Or Vault 13?}
{519}{}{Okay, then…I'm out of here.}

# 26. TALK ABOUT VILLAGE 2 (25)
{525}{}{(Renesco continues to glare at you.)}
{526}{}{And sometimes the elder gets upset at little things, like…heh-heh…that one night when I ignored my vow of
 celibacy and snuck out with Reyna - Whose - Legs - Crush - With - Strength - of - Thousand - Snakes to the Arroyo canyon…}
{1526}{}{And sometimes the elder gets upset at little things, like…heh-heh…that one night when I ignored my vow of
 chastity and snuck out with Kor - Who - Thunders - Like - a - Thousand - Stallions to the Arroyo canyon…}

# 27. TALK ABOUT VILLAGE 2 (26)
{535}{}{(Renesco gives you a withering stare.)}
{536}{}{It was like yesterday. Reyna's body glowed like silver in the moonlight when she knelt down and…hey, you know what?
 You might like the elder. She's about your age.}
{1536}{}{It was like yesterday. Kor's body rippled like bronze in the moonlight as I knelt down and…hey, you know what?
 You might like the elder. She's about your age.}

# 28. WHO ARE YOU? (27)
{545}{}{(Renesco continues to glare at you as if he could somehow make you disappear just by imagining it hard enough.)}
{546}{}{Did I mention Arroyo was founded by my ancestor, the holy Vault Dweller? He made a legendary journey from the
 south after defeating a great evil. (Puff up chest and stare proudly into the distance.) Now, *I* am the deliverer of my
 tribe, chosen to search for the holy GECK!}
{547}{}{Okay, then, enough stories…I better be on my way. Praise the Vault!}

# 29. GECK? (25, 26, 27, 28, 36)
{555}{}{(Renesco's glare crumbles.) }
{556}{}{GECK? As in 'Garden of Eden Creation Kit?' Comes with a basic replicator unit, holodisc reader with selections
 from the library of congress, and a little pen flashlight?}
{557}{}{Yes, but that's not important right now. I haven't finished telling you about Arroyo.}
{558}{}{Yes! My village is having trouble with crops, and the GECK is needed to restore them. Do you know where I can find one?}
{559}{}{It is said to be sealed within Vault 13, or so the legends say. Do you know of such a place?}
{560}{}{If you're not going to LISTEN when I recite the holy scriptures, I'm out of here.}
{561}{}{Could be. Look, I have to go.}

# 30. I HAVEN'T FINISHED TELLING YOU ABOUT ARROYO (29)
{570}{}{Your backwater herb-smoking village be damned, and you along with it. Why is
 a primate like you looking for a GECK?}
{571}{}{Arroyo…my backwater herb-smoking village, as you say…is having trouble with its crops. The GECK is needed
 to restore them.}
{572}{}{It is said to be sealed within Vault 13. Do you know of such a place?}
{573}{}{I don't think I feel like sharing that at the moment. Goodbye.}

# 31. GECK NEEDED TO RESTORE VILLAGE (29, 30)
{580}{}{Hmmmmm. It sure could do that…easy. IF you could find one. Don't even know where you'd start looking. NCR
 or Vault City, maybe, but I doubt they'd have one…still…}
{581}{}{Still…?}

# 32. GECK NEEDED TO RESTORE VILLAGE (31)
{590}{}{Still, those self-righteous bastards might be able to point you in a direction. If they speak slowly and use small words…}
{591}{}{NCR or Vault City you say? I will go in search of these places and ask their villagers about the GECK. Thank you.}
{592}{}{Why would the GECK not be in sacred Vault 13? The scriptures SAY that the GECK is sealed within the sacred Vault 13.}
{593}{}{Very funny. I had some other questions…}
{594}{}{Okay, then…I'll go check it out. Thanks.}

# 33. GECK NEEDED TO RESTORE VILLAGE (X)
{600}{}{Hell no, primate. I've heard of vaults, sure, but not Vault 13. Closest thing is Vault City to the northeast…and
 if those aristocratic jackanapes inhabited a Vault once, they sure as hell don't live there no more.}
{601}{}{Vault City, you say? I will go in search of this Vault city and ask their villagers about the GECK.
 Thank you, Renesco. Praise the Vault! }
{602}{}{"Vaults?" There is more than one Vault?}
{603}{}{Hmmm. I had some other questions…}

# 34. THANKS (32, 33, 35)
{610}{}{If you're going to Vault City, don't thank me, primate. You're better off in New Reno. At least the people
 sizing you up for a coffin are honest about it.}
{611}{}{Okay, then…I'm on my way to Vault City. Praise the Vault! }
{612}{}{I see. Thanks for the warning. }

# 35. MORE THAN ONE VAULT? (33)
{620}{}{Why do you think it's called Vault THIRTEEN, spearchucker? What, was your tribe short on brains or do you just
 perform ritual lobotomies to cleanse the tiny voice of reason that speaks in your head?}
{623}{}{Yeah, there you go sugar-talking me again. Thanks…for the info, at least. }

# 36. YOUR VOCABULARY IS IMPRESSIVE (6, 42)
{630}{}{A person's past ain't a smart topic of conversation here in New Reno. Now, what is you want?}
{632}{}{You sound like an educated man. Have you ever heard of a GECK or a place called Vault 13?}
{634}{}{Nothing, nevermind.}

# 37. GLASSES (3, 42)
{640}{}{(Renesco snatches the glasses from you and puts them on. His eyes widen.) Sweet Reno! THAT'S what this damn
 shop looks like. (Frowns.) What a mess…and what is that on the shelves? Looks like brahmin shit.}
{641}{}{You're welcome…}
{642}{}{Enjoy.}

# 38. YOU'RE WELCOME (37)
{650}{}{Hmpphh! I…hmmm…uh…where did you get these?}
{651}{}{Well, there was this tiny radscorpion, see, and there was this scientist that was training him, and...you know what? Even I
 don't believe it. Just keep them, all right?}
{652}{}{Let's just say I found them. Somewhere.}

# 39. YOU'RE WELCOME 2 (37)
{660}{}{Hey! Waitaminute! Where did you get these?}
{661}{}{Well, there was this tiny radscorpion, see, and there was this scientist that was training him, and...you know what? Even I
 don't believe it. Just keep them, all right?}

# 40. I GOT THEM (38, 39)
{670}{}{Well, I…hmnnn…I'm…eh, grateful. I thought I was going to have to suffer with those broken frames for the
 rest of my life. If I can do something for you, you let me know…and, uh, I'll THINK about it.}
{671}{}{How about a discount?}
{672}{}{Nevermind…look, just wear them in good health, okay? I had some other questions…}
{673}{}{Someday - and that day may never come - I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day
 accept these glasses as a gift on my daughter's wedding day. }

# 41. DISCOUNT (40)
{680}{}{Ehhh…}
{681}{}{Errr….}
{682}{}{Well…}
{683}{}{Okay! Okay! I'll give you a discount! Hmphhh.}
{684}{}{C'mon. Just a little discount. C'mon…}
{687}{}{Great! Let's see what you've got, "buddy."}
{688}{}{Excellent! Say, I had some other questions…}
{689}{}{I'll be back to shop later. }

# 42. QUESTIONS? (8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 32, 33, 41, 49, 50, 51, 54, 55, 57, 65, 66, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75)
{700}{}{Make it quick.}
{701}{}{Look, I'm a busy man…}
{702}{}{Well? Out with it already!}
{703}{}{Yeah?}
{704}{}{Did I ever tell you about my village Arroyo?}
{706}{}{Did you sell Jet to Richard Wright?}
{707}{}{I've come to collect Mr. Salvatore's tribute.}
{710}{}{I'm looking for some mine parts for Broken Hills…}
{711}{}{You have an interesting vocabulary…are you from around here?}
{712}{}{Nevermind. }

# 43.  TOOLS: SO? (3, 42)
{725}{}{(Eyes narrow.) So?}
{726}{}{Well, I need the parts to fix the air purifier in their mine. I was told you could help me.}
{727}{}{Well, I need the parts to fix the air purifier in their mine. Zaius sent me. He said, uh…said...uh...shit.}
{728}{}{Well, I need the parts to fix the air purifier in their mine. Zaius sent me. He said, 'The canary's kicked the bucket.'}

# 44.  TOOLS: SURE. HERE'S SOME MONEY (43)
{735}{}{Yes, I do happen to have some parts that could fix the air purifier. 100 bucks.}
{736}{}{I'll take it. Here you go.}
{737}{}{How about fifty bucks?}
{738}{}{Uh, I don't have a hundred on me…I'll be back later with the cash. }

# 45.  200 OR NOTHING (3, 42, 44)
{745}{}{Inflation due to managerial irritation with hagglers. 200 or nothing.}
{746}{}{(Frowns.) 200 or nothing.}
{747}{}{Two hundred?! You said a HUNDRED a second ago!}
{748}{}{Uh, I'll take it. Here you go.}
{749}{}{Uh, I don't have two hundred on me…I'll be back later with the cash. }

# 46.  HE SAID: SHIT (43)
{755}{}{I STRONGLY doubt that is what he said. It wasn't 'The canary's kicked the bucket,' was it?}
{756}{}{Well, yes.}

# 47.  HE SAID: AND . . . (43, 46)
{760}{}{And…?}
{761}{}{"And?"}

# 48.  SECOND PART? (47)
{765}{}{And the SECOND part was…?}
{766}{}{"Second part?" He didn't say anything about a SECOND part. That low-down bast -!}

# 49.  HE DIDN'T?! THAT BASTARD! (44, 45)
{769}{}{Just testing you. There is no second part. Well, if Zaius sent you, I SUPPOSE I have some parts to spare. }
{770}{}{Here you go. Don't drop them.}
{771}{}{Thanks. I had some other questions…}
{772}{}{Uh, thanks. }

# 50. YOU SELL DRUGS TO WRIGHT'S SON? (7, 10, 42)
{780}{}{Don't you even TRY and pin that accusation on me. You want to know who did it, ask Tweedledum and Tweedledumber
 if they're still selling Jet laced with arsenic.}
{781}{}{'Tweedledum' and 'Tweedledumber?' Who are they?}
{782}{}{Jules said to ask you. He says you sell bad shit.}
{783}{}{Jagged Jimmy said to ask you. He says you sell bad shit.}
{784}{}{They both said to ask YOU about it. They say you sell bad shit.}
{785}{}{I don't think it was arsenic...I DO think he was poisoned, though.}
{786}{}{Can you tell me anything about this empty Jet canister?}
{788}{}{I'll go ask them then. }

# 51. WHO ARE THEY? (50)
{795}{}{That vulture Jules and that lying reprobate 'Jagged Jimmy.' Jules is always perched near the entrance
 to town looking for ignorant visitors to victimize, and Jagged Jimmy deals on 2nd Street to the rest of the Reno cattle.}
{798}{}{They said to ask you. They say you sell bad shit. Shit that kills people.}
{800}{}{I'll go talk to them then. }

# 52. THEY SAID ASK YOU. (51)
{805}{}{Look, primate…you don't even KNOW what you're babbling about.}
{806}{}{Oh, I think I -}
{807}{}{Yeah? Well then, why don't -}
{808}{}{Nevermind. I had some other qu -}
{809}{}{Look I better be go -}

# 53. THEY SAID ASK YOU 2. (52)
{815}{}{OPEN your mouth again and even a WHISPER, even a HINT, reaches Mr. Wright that I…or you…might've had anything
 to do that boy's OD, our lives ain't worth Brahmin shit. If THAT happens --}
{816}{}{Oh? So you -}
{817}{}{Me?! Now hold on just a -}

# 54. THEY SAID ASK YOU 3. (53)
{825}{}{If THAT happens, you tribal SHIT, I SWEAR you'll die before I do. Now…for the LAST time, that kid never bought SHIT
 from me, understand? Don't you EVER say his name in here again, or so help me…}
{826}{}{JULES says he didn't sell to the kid. JIMMY says he didn't sell to the kid. YOU say you didn't sell to him. One
 of you is lying.}
{827}{}{JULES says he didn't sell to the kid. JIMMY says he didn't sell to the kid. YOU say you didn't sell to him. Either
 you all are lying, or...somebody else is responsible.}
{828}{}{Can you tell me anything else about Richard Wright? Who did he hang around who might have used drugs?}
{829}{}{All right...look, I had some other questions...}
{830}{}{Okay, okay...I'm going now. }

# 55. THEY SAID THEY DON'T KNOW. (54)
{835}{}{I can answer that easy. One of those two mongrels is lying to save their behind. Between the two, they
 sell 90% of the Jet in Reno, and that's the only place the 'boy' we're talking about could've gotten it from.}
{836}{}{Or somebody that bought from one of you three. Who were your customers last month who might have had contact
 with…the victim?}
{837}{}{Can you tell me anything else about Richard Wright? Did he hang around anyone else who might have used drugs?}
{838}{}{I see...I had some other questions...}
{839}{}{I'm going now. }

# 56. THEY SAID ASK YOU. (55)
{845}{}{You STUPID bastard. }
{846}{}{You STUPID bitch. }
{847}{}{I TOLD you not to say his name in here. Get out! I see you again, I'll SHOOT YOU DEAD. If Mr. Wright comes looking
 for me, thinks I killed his boy, YOU'LL die first.}
{848}{}{Don't threaten me, old man…}
{849}{}{Whoa. I'm going now. }

# 57. KILLER REVEALED! . . . (55)
{855}{}{I have NO idea. I didn't know the boy, so I don't know his friends OR his habits. The only one who could tell
 you for sure is too busy being dead in Golgotha to tell you.}
{856}{}{Golgotha?}
{858}{}{Maybe I'll do that. Goodbye. }

# 58. TRIBUTE (3, 42)
{865}{}{Then you wasted a trip. I PAID Mr. Salvatore his 'tribute' *two weeks ago,* as per the schedule. I don't know
 who you are, or what you think you're doing, but you aren't getting one red chip from me. Get.}
{866}{}{Look, gramps. Stop giving me a hard time. Cough up the chips, or you'll be coughing up blood.}
{867}{}{I am Mr. Salvatore's representative. You will give me the tribute I have asked for, and you will do so now.}
{868}{}{I'll check with Mr. Salvatore about the schedule, then I'll be back. }

# 59. TRIBUTE 2 (58)
{875}{}{You lose your hearing, boy? }
{876}{}{You lose your hearing, girl? }
{877}{}{I SAID I. PAID. THE. TRIBUTE. ALREADY. *Two weeks ago.* If you were really from Salvatore, you would know that. Now git!}
{878}{}{Look. Last time: Hand over the chips.}
{879}{}{You are the one who has lost your hearing. I am Mr. Salvatore's representative, and you will pay the tribute.}
{880}{}{I warned you, gramps. Looks like we'll be doing this the hard way. Time to die.}
{881}{}{I'll check with Mr. Salvatore about the tribute, then I'll be back. }

# 60. SPEECH SUCCESS (59)
{890}{}{Prove you're from Salvatore, and I'll CONSIDER giving you the chips. Else, you aren't getting shit.}
{891}{}{I do not need to prove myself. I am his representative, and that is all you need to know.}
{892}{}{What, you think this laser pistol is just for show?}
{893}{}{If you do not give me the tribute in five seconds, I WILL kill you.}

# 61. SPEECH FAILURE (59, 60)
{900}{}{Get the hell out of here, you penny-ante thug! You so much as show your face in here again, and I'll shoot you myself!}
{901}{}{I warned you. Time to die.}

# 62. SHOW OFFICIAL, CAN'T PAY (3, 42, 60)
{910}{}{Hmmmph. Don't matter, I can't pay. The last collection nearly wiped me out.}
{911}{}{That is not my concern. You will get me the money now. Mr. Salvatore does not want to hear your excuses.}

# 63. GIVE ME MONEY EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T PAY (62)
{920}{}{Threatening me ain't gonna help. Mr. Salvatore wants his money. I don't have it. He'll be mad at me, but he'll
 be mad at you, too. Salvatore doesn't LIKE people who let him down…you better figure out something quick.}
{921}{}{I already have. I will pay your share for this period. In exchange, you will give me a discount at your store.}
{924}{}{I'll try and figure something out…I'll be back.}

# 64. IN EXCHANGE FOR FREE ACCESS TO YOUR STORE (63)
{930}{}{Now hold on, you Neanderthal…}
{931}{}{I will not argue with you anymore. My patience is at an end. Those are my terms.}

# 65. THOSE ARE MY TERMS (64)
{940}{}{I...look, now, I...hmmmm...all right, then. You get a…"discount."}
{941}{}{Let me see your stock. I will make my 'purchases' now.}
{943}{}{I don't want anything now, but don't worry, I'll be back. }

# 66. HOW'S THE GLASSES (64)
{950}{}{(Folds arms.) Adequate. If you are expecting some handout for being a Good Samaritan, you are GRAVELY
 mistaken. Now…what do you want?}
{951}{}{Goddamn whatever Deathclaw or marketing director spawned you! You WANT something?! Here! HERE! Take THIS!
 Take ALL I have! Anything to get you to LEAVE ME ALONE!}
{952}{}{Let me see your stock.}
{953}{}{I had some questions…}
{955}{}{What the hell IS this…? }

# 67. POISONED (50)
{960}{}{Poisoned? What are you babbling about?}
{961}{}{The body's condition was consistent with Radscorpion poisoning. I think he died because his Jet was poisoned,
 NOT because of an overdose.}
{962}{}{I found an empty Jet canister in his room. It had traces of Radscorpion venom in it.}
{963}{}{Nevermind. I had some other questions...}
{964}{}{Forget it. I have to be going now. }

# 68. POISONED 2 (67, 73, 74)
{970}{}{Radscorpion...? (Renesco suddenly freezes, as if remembering something.)}
{971}{}{You son of a bitch. You *poisoned* the kid, didn't you?}
{972}{}{You know something about it, don't you?}

# 69. POISONED 3 (68)
{980}{}{Whoa! Now wait just a minute...!}
{981}{}{Don't mess with me, Renesco! You try and weasel out of this one, and you'll be joining Richard. Understand?}
{982}{}{That's it. Me and Mr. Wright are going to have a little talk. Good day, Renesco...or should I say, "goodbye."}

# 70. POISONED 4 (69)
{990}{}{Wait a minute! Look...I didn't SELL it to the kid! He never bought ANYTHING from me! I...was ASKED
 to make some Jet laced with radscorpion venom, but...but I DIDN'T sell it to the kid!}
{991}{}{You were ASKED to make poisoned Jet? For who?}
{992}{}{Who DID you sell it to?}

# 71. POISONED 5 (70)
{995}{}{The Salvatores requested it -- they said it was a..."special order." I didn't know they were going to give
 it to the Wright kid. You HAVE to believe me...I don't poison kids!}
{996}{}{Just adults, huh, Renesco? You sorry son of a bitch...}
{997}{}{WHY did you poison the Jet? You had to know they were going to kill someone with it.}
{998}{}{All right, all right, I believe you. I had some other questions...}
{999}{}{Just shut up. Look, I had some other questions...}
{1000}{}{The Salvatores, huh? I think Mr. Wright will want to know about this. }

# 72. RESPONSE (71)
{1005}{}{The Salvatores OWN me, they OWN this place, and when they want something, I give it to them, or they'll kill
 me and have me replaced. I never meant any harm to that boy.}
{1007}{}{Just shut up. Look, I had some other questions for you...}
{1008}{}{Yeah, I'm sure you had the best of intentions while you were spiking that Jet with poison. Goodbye, Renesco.}
{1009}{}{Later, Renesco. }

# 73. JET CANISTER (50)
{1020}{}{It's empty. It's a Jet canister like the hundreds of others all over New Reno. Anything else I can help you with?}
{1021}{}{Does this belong to you?}
{1022}{}{Know anything about the radscorpion venom traces that are in this canister?}
{1023}{}{Yeah, I had some other questions...}

# 74. JET CANISTER (73)
{1030}{}{No. Anything ELSE I can help you with?}
{1033}{}{No. Goodbye. }

# 75. GOLGOTHA? (57)
{1040}{}{Golgotha? Mass graveyard outside of town to the south. Follow the stench...the one OTHER than your own.}
{1041}{}{Oh. I had some other questions...}
{1042}{}{You keep sweet-talking me like that, Renesco, and you'll be a long time dying. }
{1043}{}{THANKS, Renesco. }

{2000}{}{You have exposed Renesco's involvement in Richard Wright's death.}

# END LINES
{5257}{}{ is so big. Me go now }
{5259}{}{ no shout WHY YOU KEEP SHOUTING BE STOPPING THE SHOUTING }
{6259}{}{ KILL YOU}
{5260}{}{…*sniff*…go get big brother to beat you up, old man! Then we'll have ice cream and…*sniff*…CAKE
 and a big party with clowns and…}
