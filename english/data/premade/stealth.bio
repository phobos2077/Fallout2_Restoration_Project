
MINGAN'S STORY:

Mingan's whisper-soft
tread and acquisitive
fingers have always
aided his natural
curiosity. Several years
ago the tribe decided
that Mingan's talents
would be best used on
someone else. Since then
Mingan has been the
tribe's most
accomplished scout.
However, the tents of
nearby tribes provide
little challenge these
days. It's time to scout
farther afield.
